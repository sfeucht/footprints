4,4844821,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro%20Co%20RAT,Pro Co RAT,"The Pro Co ""The RAT"" is a distortion pedal produced by Pro Co Sound. The original RAT was developed in the basement of Pro Co's Kalamazoo, Michigan facility in 1978. Numerous variations of the original RAT pedal are still being produced today.

The pedal has changed in appearance over the years, but its tone has remained largely the same. Pro Co has also introduced variations of the RAT, including the Turbo RAT and the You Dirty RAT, among others.

History
The origins of the Pro Co ""The RAT"" can be traced back to the mid-1970s, when Pro Co engineers, Scott Burnham and Steve Kiraly repaired and hot-rodded existing distortion pedals, such as the Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face. Burnham decided he could build a superior product from the ground up, and designed ""The RAT"" pedal.

In 1978, ""The RAT"" was being built as a custom-order product. Only twelve of these pedals (including one prototype), commonly referred to as the ""Bud Box"" RAT, were produced. Each pedal was built in a standard project box, hand painted, and hand drilled. In 1979, Pro Co began mass-producing them. This iteration was built in a custom designed, rectangular sheet-metal enclosure, with an L shaped removable top/back section giving access to the internals. The top panel was labeled with Pro Co Sound ""The RAT"" and the three control knobs as Distortion, Tone and Volume.

In 1983, Pro Co switched to a smaller, U-shaped enclosure. Finally, in 1988, the RAT2 was introduced, which included an on/off LED. Various RAT2 circuit board layouts and wiring configurations have surfaced in the last few years, including the noted ""RAT3 version A and B"" all under the RAT2 moniker. The RAT2 model is still available today, but in 2008 production moved to China and is now manufactured by Neutrik for Pro Co Sound.

Other models of RAT products include:

Circuitry 

The Pro Co ""The RAT"" is a distortion pedal with a quite simple circuit, which can be broken down into four simpler blocks: distortion stage, tone control, output stage and power supply.

The design is based around a single opamp, originally the Motorola LM308 (switched to Texas Instruments OP07DP around 2002-2003). The distortion is produced using a variable gain circuit with diodes shorting the output to ground at a certain voltage level to produce hard clipping of the input waveform. Originally, 1N914 diodes were used, which were later replaced with 1N4148 since RAT2. The 'Turbo RAT' pedal uses red LEDs for this purpose (red LEDs have about a twice as high forward voltage as the original silicon diodes), while the 'You Dirty RAT' pedal uses 1N34A germanium diodes (clipping at a lower forward voltage). The distortion stage is followed by a passive 'reverse' tone filter and volume control.

The general design is very similar to the Boss DS-1 distortion pedal. A major difference is the opamp used (the LM308). Known for its poor slew rate, it largely accounts for the sonic difference between the two pedals.

Popular modifications to the RAT
The RAT is a popular pedal for modifying. Some of the possible modifications include:

 Resistor Mods: The Ruetz RAT mod which involves simply cutting the 47 Ω resistor to disengage half of the drive circuit. Gain is reduced somewhat and the bass is no longer attenuated. Additionally, the 560 Ω resistor controlling the lower half of the distortion filter can receive similar treatment. Either mod will translate to a thicker (fuzz like) bass response at the expense of losing distortion.
 Toggle Switches: The Mightier Mouse mod involves a 3-way switch to select between RAT / RAT2 (clipping via silicon diodes), Turbo RAT (clipping via red LEDs), and FAT RAT (MOSFET clipping) modes. It also shows an alternative to the Ruetz RAT mod by using a potentiometer or trimpot to replace the resistor instead of cutting it out of the circuit.
 Diode Lift: Removing one of the two (asymmetric clipping) or both (pure opamp clipping) clipping diodes results in a volume boost with a crunchier tone.
 Chip Substitutions: The original RAT pedals featured the rare Motorola LM308 opamp, which is now quite expensive to acquire. Recent RAT2 pedals nowawadays feature the widely available Texas Instruments OP07DP. Other opamps that people try, include: the CA3130EZ (MOSFET-based), the NE5535A / NE5534AP (high slew rate, low noise), the LM741 (low drive) and finally the TL071 / TL081 (both BI-FET based). Many RAT modders install an opamp socket to enable easy swapping of opamps, which is similar to what people do with the Ibanez Tube Screamer circuit.
 Capacitor Mods: ""softening"" ceramic caps replaced with silver mica or metal film caps for better tonal fidelity. These include the 30 pF cap riding the opamp chip and the single 100 pF cap.
 Power Jack: 2.1 mm (Roland / BOSS-style) 9 V DC adapter socket mod. Because the tip on the BOSS-style adapter is negative, one needs to install a plastic 2.1 mm socket to avoid shorting out the barrel of the plug against the RAT's steel chassis (note, the official website says it uses a positive tip adapter).

Clones
Because of the RAT's popularity, numerous large and small pedal designers and manufacturers have attempted to replicate its sound as 'clones' or in new designs. Often the goal of these 'clones' is to capture the sound of vintage RATS at a more affordable price point. Many RAT clones allow users to switch between the different RAT circuits (Turbo, standard, etc) or between eras (Whiteface, LM308 Chip, Big box...). The simplicity of the circuit has also made it popular among pedal-kit manufacturers for first-time builders. Some examples of RAT 'clones' are:

6,18212193,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy%20Longmore,Roy Longmore,"Roy Longmore (29 April 1894 – 21 June 2001) was an Australian soldier and centenarian, who after Alec Campbell, was noted as the second last living Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) veteran who saw service in World War I.

ANZAC soldier
Longmore set aside his life as a farm-hand in Geelong, Victoria, when he enlisted in the Australian Army with the branch of the Australian Imperial Force at age 21.  Private (Pte) Roy Longmore, 3rd Reinforcements, 21st Battalion, of Bannockburn, Victoria enlisted on 13 July 1915; and he embarked from Melbourne aboard HMAT Anchises on 26 August 1915. After training in Egypt, was sent to the Battle of Gallipoli where he was a sapper with the 2nd Division, burrowing underneath the Turkish positions and laying mines.  After evacuation from Turkey, he fought at Pozières, Armentières, and Villers-Bretonneux. He was wounded three times in France and was momentarily given up for dead when he was shot as the Armistice in November 1918, approached.  He later recalled, 
""We were patrolling in a gully when suddenly half a dozen Germans appeared over a hill armed with machine guns and opened fire. Jerry riddled me, knocking me flat on my back, and the last I heard was 'Longy's had it, they got him.'""
Fortunately, his fellow soldiers saw him move and rescued him. Lance Sergeant (LSgt) and returned to Australia on 16 March 1919 as a member of the 2nd Pioneer Battalion.

Civilian life
After returning to Australia in 1919, his injuries made returning to farm work impossible, so he drove a taxi in Melbourne.  Another change caused by the war was more telling.  Before, he had hunted rabbits; but he later explained that when he returned home, he no longer had an appetite for firing at anything alive.

Longmore married and had one son, Eric. The one-time LSgt Longmore died peacefully in his sleep at a Burwood Nursing Home aged 107 on 21 June 2001. He was the second last Anzac to die. At his death, Australia honored him one final time with a state funeral.

Australian ""legend""
In 2000, Longmore along with fellow ANZAC veterans Alec Campbell and Walter Parker was recognized as an ""Australian Legends.""  His name and photograph were honored as part of an annual series of commemorative postage stamps issued by Australia Post since 1997.  The stamps commemorate living Australians ""who have made lifetime contributions to the development of Australia's national identity and character"". Longmore lived to fully enjoy this honor.

Longmore's 45-cent Legend stamp displays the soldier's portrait as a young man, photographed just prior to his departure for Gallipoli. Formal photographs of the other two ANZAC centenarians complete this stamp set, titled0, The Last ANZAC's  In addition, a fourth stamp features the 1914-15 star medal which was presented to all those who fought in campaigns during those war years. These stamps, designed by Cathleen Cram of the Australia Post Design Studio, commemorate the story of events and people shaping contemporary Australia. 
The Longmore stamp honors him as an individual and as a representative of all 68,000 soldiers at Gallipoli whose actions affected Australia's evolving self-image.

The college was founded in 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I at the request of Hugh Price, a Welsh clergyman, who was Treasurer of St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. The college still has strong links with Wales, and about 15% of students are Welsh. There are 340 undergraduates and 190 students carrying out postgraduate studies. Women have been admitted since 1974, when the college was one of the first five men's colleges to become co-educational. Old members of Jesus College are sometimes known as ""Jesubites"".

Mathematicians who have studied at Jesus College include Nigel Hitchin (Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford 1997–2016), Jonathan Borwein (a former Rhodes Scholar who has held professorial appointments in Canada and Australia), and Jim Mauldon (who taught at Oxford before moving to the United States to teach at Amherst College in Massachusetts). David E. Evans is Professor of Mathematics at Cardiff University, and H. W. Lloyd Tanner was Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy at one of its predecessor institutions, the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire.  Several noted individuals from biology, botany and zoology were educated at the college, including the Welsh clergyman Hugh Davies (whose Welsh Botanology of 1813 was the first publication to cross-reference the Welsh-language and the scientific names of plants), Edward Bagnall Poulton (Professor of Zoology at Oxford) and James Brontë Gatenby (Professor of Zoology at Trinity College, Dublin).  Frank Greenaway was Keeper of the Department of Chemistry at the Science Museum in London for over 20 years, and the physicist Chris Rapley was director of the museum 2007–2010.  Other physicists who are Old Members of the college include Michael Woolfson (a former Professor of Physics at the University of York) and Edward Hinds (whose work on ultra-cold matter won him the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society in 2008).  Edwin Stevens, who studied Natural Science at the college, designed the world's first wearable hearing aid, and Sir Graham Sutton became director-general of the Meteorological Office ('Met Office').

The college had its own science laboratories from 1907 to 1947, which were overseen (for all but the last three years) by the physical chemist David Chapman, a Fellow of the college from 1907 to 1944.  At the time of their closure, they were the last college-based science laboratories at the university. They were named the Sir Leoline Jenkins laboratories, after a former principal of the college.  Scientific research and tuition (particularly in chemistry) became an important part of the college's academic life after the construction of the laboratories. The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College those graduates of the University of Wales who wished to continue their research at Oxford.  One of the college science lecturers had a link with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI); 17 students joined ICI between the two World Wars, some of whom (such as John Rose) reached senior levels in the company.  The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students, and they were closed in 1947.

14,51847753,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20the%20Buliok%20Complex,Battle of the Buliok Complex,"The Battle of the Buliok Complex took place on 11 February 2003 in an area within the provinces of Maguindanao and Cotabato in Mindanao, Philippines. The 60-hectare complex, which stretches from Pikit, Cotabato to Pagalungan, Maguindanao, was a stronghold of the Muslim separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Accused by the Philippine government of harboring members of Pentagon, a notorious kidnap-for-ransom gang operating in Mindanao, the MILF was attacked in the Buliok complex by the Armed Forces of the Philippines under orders from then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

Background

After losing their camps, foremost of which was Camp Abubakar, due to the ""all-out-war"" policy of then-President Joseph Estrada in 2000, the MILF withdrew into the areas around the Liguasan Marsh. The Buliok Complex (called the Buliok Islamic Center or the Buliok Mosque by the MILF) encompasses areas where the boundaries of Maguindanao, Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat meet. It was within this complex that the MILF re-established their presence.

The battle
The Philippine government commenced military operations against the MILF on the day Eid al-Adha was being celebrated, tactically reasoning that the MILF forces would be vulnerable to attack. The government at first would not state the reason for the attack on the complex; later it would admit that the main objective was the MILF itself, in order for the government to maintain the dominant position in the conflict. Jesus Dureza, chairman of the government panel during peace talks with the MILF during this time, is on record stating that the attack on the Buliok complex came after the government failed to forge a ceasefire agreement with the MILF.

Aftermath
The Buliok complex was captured by government forces on 13 February 2003. A month after, the MILF attempted to retake their lost stronghold in an offensive that resulted in the deaths of 68-200 of their members. During this period, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the MILF exchanged widely-conflicting casualty reports. Government military officials commented on how ""youthful-looking"" the slain MILF fighters were; Mohagher Iqbal, then-spokesman of the MILF central committee, admitted that some of their fighters were ""able-bodied teenagers"" who voluntarily joined the MILF.

Salamat Hashim, the founder of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, died by year's end.

In seismology, it is the standard of localizing earthquakes. The scheme was proposed in 1965 by Edward A. Flinn and E. R. Engdahl. The first official definition was published in 1974 and a revision in 1995. Because each F-E region is composed of 1x1 degree blocks with integer latitudes and longitudes, the borders of the F–E regions may differ from political boundaries. For instance, the F–E region 545 (""Northern Italy"") also includes parts of France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. After the 1995 revision there are 754 F–E regions, sequentially numbered from 1 to 757 with three gaps (172, 299 and 550) at dissolved regions. The regions are grouped into 50 larger seismic regions.

21,58829904,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin%20Hern,Kevin Hern,"Kevin Ray Hern (born December 4, 1961) is an American businessman and politician from the state of Oklahoma. A Republican, he is a member of the United States House of Representatives for . He was first elected in 2018.

Early life and education
Hern graduated from Dover High School in Dover, Arkansas, in 1980, and Arkansas Tech University in 1986. He worked at Rockwell International and attended the Georgia Institute of Technology, studying for a Ph.D. in astronautical engineering.

Career 
After the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Hern had difficulty finding a job, and became a McDonald's franchisee. He bought his first McDonald's in North Little Rock, Arkansas in 1997. He sold the North Little Rock franchise in 1999 to move to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where he bought two franchises. He expanded his business to 18 franchises in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, area.

U.S. House of Representatives

Elections 
2018

After Jim Bridenstine resigned from the United States House of Representatives in 2018 to become administrator of NASA, Hern ran to succeed him in  in the 2018 elections. Hern advanced to the runoff, where he defeated Tim Harris. He then advanced to the general election, where he defeated Democratic nominee Tim Gilpin. Outgoing Governor Mary Fallin then appointed Hern to serve the balance of Bridenstine's third term. She was able to do so because under Oklahoma law, if a House seat falls vacant in an even-numbered year and the incumbent's term is due to end the following year, the governor can appoint someone to serve the remainder of the term. Accordingly, Hern was sworn into the House on November 13.

2020

Hern defeated Democratic nominee Kojo Asamoa-Caesar and Independent Evelyn L. Rogers in the November 2020 general election.

Tenure
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hern's KTAK Corporation received between $1 million and $2 million in federally backed small business loans from American Bank and Trust as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. KTAK stated it would retain 220 jobs. The loan was seen as notable since Hern is a vocal opponent of deficit spending; in 2018, discussing a balanced budget, he said, ""While there is no easy fix to this, the first step is clear: stop adding to it."" In 2020, he said, ""This isn't a bailout. It's a repayment of what the government has taken away from American workers and businesses."" KTAK operates franchises. During the Paycheck Protection Program negotiations, Hern pushed to increase the amount of aid going to franchises.

In December 2020, Hern was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

In July 2021, Hern voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan, while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407–16.

Immigration 
Hern voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

Hern voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).

Operational history
Puriri was owned by the Anchor Shipping and Foundry Company. She was one of four ships requisitioned as a consequence of the 's minefield and the loss of the liner , the others being ,  and . Puriri was taken over on 20 November 1940 and handed to the dockyard for conversion.

She was commissioned on 19 April 1941, and assigned to the 25th Minesweeping Flotilla, which was assigned to sweep German mines in the Hauraki Gulf.

Fate
On 13 May 1941, the launch Rawea attached a buoy to a German mine that had been caught in a fishing net eight miles north-east of Bream Head. Puriri and HMNZS Gale were sent to deactivate it, and arrived in the area the next day. Gale sailed past the mine without seeing it, but Puriri, also not seeing the mine, struck it at 11 am. The explosion caused the ship to immediately sink at  and now lies at a depth of 98m.

Of the 31 aboard, five were killed or drowned, and three seamen were injured, one seriously. Gale rescued the 26 survivors.

Season
Entering the season, UCLA joined several other schools in the Pacific Coast Conference, though ice hockey was not yet sponsored by the conference. They were also joined on the ice by two other California programs (California and Loyola) for their first official seasons. UCLA, however did have to content with several problems throughout the season. The first issue was a lack of a head coach for the team. Former team captain Harvey Tafe was brought in to keep the team afloat. The Bruins also had to scramble to find a place to practice and were only able to schedule three games on the year. The team didn't even meet until February 25 but, by the time they did, the program had been rescued from the abyss. The reason the team was so late in starting was that the school's administration had decided to discontinue the program after the second season but a later meeting approved its renewal for the spring semester.

After some wrangling, the team scheduled three games against USC with the first coming on March 12. Unsurprisingly, with the Trojans having been together for far longer than the Bruins, UCLA lost a lopsided affair to begin their season. Afterwards, UCLA played far better against Southern California. The return of Chester Englund between the pipes helped keep their final two games within one goal, though they lost both.

Jacobs served as team manager.

Note: UCLA used the same colors as UC-Berkley until 1949.

Its Gaelic Football team participates in competitions organized by Cork GAA, and is a member of Beara division. The club, like the other Beara clubs, does nor field a hurling team.

History
The Castletownbere GAA Club like most of the GAA Clubs in Beara was officially affiliated to the GAA in 1927, when the divisional system was established.  Gaelic Football was however played for many years prior to 1927 in Castletownbere and there were various teams throughout the parish. 
There was a team from the Town called The Magpies who wore Black and White jerseys.  These were the colours adopted by the club when it affiliated in 1927.  The colours did change to green and subsequently blue but have long since returned to the traditional Black and White.
The club had to wait until 1942 to contest its first Beara Championship final and a further five years until 1947 to win the Beara Title for the first time.  Between 1947 and 1976 the club won nine Divisional Championships.  In 1963, 1964, and 1965 a second team from the parish Rosmacowen entered the Beara Championship.  The two teams met in the Beara Championship in 1965 with the Castletownbere team winning.  Between 1966 and 1970 Rosmacowen formed a team with Bere Island called St Brendan's.
In 1974 Castletownbere club contested its first Cork Junior Football Championship Final when a team captained by Donal Holland lost by 1-7 0-8 to Fermoy.  This was repeated in 1976 when Castlehaven defeated a team captained by Ger Batt O Sullivan by 3-7 to 0-6 in the County Final.
1977 proved to be a historical year for the club when on the occasion of its 50th anniversary a team captained by Seanie O Sullivan won the club's tenth Beara Championship and first County Championship.  Rockchapel were defeated in the county final at Macroom on a score line of 3-5 to 0-8.
In 1978 Castletownbere entered the Intermediate ranks and played at this level until 1986 when they won the Cork Intermediate Football Championship. Once again, the venue was Macroom, as the club beat Kilshannig by 1-8 to 0-7.
The 1987 season saw Castletownbere compete at senior level for the first time when they defeated Carrigdhoun by 4-11 to 0-5 in the first round of the championship.  They were eventually beaten at the quarter final stage by the reigning County Champions Imokilly.  The club again played in the senior championship in 1988 before returning to the intermediate grade in 1989.  The club contested five County Intermediate finals in 1990, 1997, 1999, 2006 and 2011 but it was only in 2012 that they would finally win the intermediate championship. Captained by Alan O Regan, Castletownbere defeated Éire Óg on a scoreline of 1-12 to 0-13.

It began life as a computer-bulletin board system on CompuServe Information Service before the start of the Internet proper.

The organisation itself claims to be the world's oldest continually-operated online forum.  It was founded by The Aviation Safety Institute's John B. Galipault (1930–1993) and Sandy Trevor on the CompuServe Information Service in 1981.  Forum participants represent all areas of the aviation industry, and core discussion ranges from airmanship to regulatory issues. The ""Special Interest Group"" phraseology in ""Aviation Special Interest Group"" derives from CompuServe service command line navigation convention where discussion forums were prefaced by SUBJECT/SIG, as in ""AVIATION/SIG"" or ""AVSIG.""  AVSIG was the first ""SIG"" discussion site on the CompuServe service.  The Aviation Safety Institute moved the AVSIG forum to the web concurrent with its termination of a hosting contract with CompuServe in 2004.  AVSIG is the world's oldest continuously-operated online forum and one of a handful of pre-web online discussion forums operating today.  The forum is noted for requiring real names for posting to encourage both authenticity and polite discourse.  As of February, 2013 the AVSIG forum has registered over 1,300 users.

He was drafted 26th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, and made his NHL debut with them in 2014. Danault also played six seasons for the Montreal Canadiens.

Playing career
As a youth, Danault played in the 2005 and 2006 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the Victoriaville Tigres minor ice hockey team. He later played junior ice hockey with the Victoriaville Tigres and Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He was selected 26th overall in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks.

On March 30, 2012, he was assigned to the Blackhawks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs.

In the 2014–15 season, Danault was recalled from the IceHogs by the Blackhawks and made his NHL debut on November 22, 2014, in a 7–1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.

Danault was initially assigned to the Rockford IceHogs to begin the 2015–16 season. On December 18, 2015, Danault was recalled from Rockford to the Blackhawks, and on December 20, he earned his first NHL point with an assist on Andrew Shaw's goal in a 4–3 win against the San Jose Sharks. He scored his first career NHL goal on January 8, 2016, the game-winner in a 3–1 win against the Buffalo Sabres. After solidifying a role amongst the Blackhawks' fourth line and contributing with 5 points in 30 games, on February 26, 2016, Danault was acquired by the Montreal Canadiens (along with Chicago's second-round pick in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft) in exchange for forwards Dale Weise and Tomáš Fleischmann. On July 5, 2016, Danault re-signed with the Canadiens on a two-year contract.

On January 13, 2018 during a game against the Boston Bruins, Danault was hit in the head by a shot from Zdeno Chára. Danault remained motionless on the ice for several minutes. He was eventually stretchered off the ice and taken to the hospital. The Canadiens  lost the game 4–3 in a shootout.

On July 15, 2018, Phillip re-signed with the Canadiens agreeing to a three-year contract. On 22 December 2018, Danault scored his first career NHL hat-trick in a 4–3 overtime victory against the Vegas Golden Knights. Danault finished the 2018–19 season with a career-high 53 points, and finished seventh in votes for the Selke Trophy.

Danault became an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2021, and on July 28, he signed a six-year, $33 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings.

The final was contested by Cork of Munster and Galway of Connacht, with Cork winning by 0-12 to 0-11.

The All-Ireland final between Cork and Galway was the eighth championship meeting between the two teams but their first in an All-Ireland final. Cork were appearing in their first final since defeat in 1977, while Galway were appearing in their first final since 1979.

Having lost the senior All-Ireland decider to Kilkenny the previous week, Cork's under-21 team featured three players - Ger Cunningham, Kevin Hennessy and Tony O'Sullivan - who had played in that game. Both defences were in complete control in the first ever goalless final. The game hung in the balance throughout, with Cork coming from behind in the closing stages to win by a long-range Kevin Hennessy point.

Cork's All-Ireland victory was their first since 1976. The win gave them their eighth All-Ireland title overall and further secured their position as first on the all time roll of honour.

Galway's All-Ireland defeat was their second since last winning the title in 1978.

Giovanni Manfredini (Cremona, 1730- Cremona, December 9, 1790) was an Italian painter and architect.

He was a pupil of Giovanni Battista Zaist. He also worked also an architect and decoration in Cremona. He worked in the hall of canenichesse of San Benedetto, and painted for the salons in the houses of the Magio and Gerenzani family
His major work in Cremona was painting the interior of the church of San Faccio, also called Il Foppone. The ceilings are painted with architectural motifs and fixtures. The spandrels of the cupola are painted with the four virtues.  The cupola is decorated with the apostles.

The three sons of Giovanni were painters. The oldest, Paolo Manfredini, (1754-November 25, 1805) had modest talents. One of the middle sons, Giuseppe Manfredini, was an ornamental painter, painting in the salons of the houses of Manna e Stanga in the Stanga. Giuseppe moved to Brescia where he died in 1815. The youngest brother, Serafino Manfredini, showed the most talent. He painted extensively in the Cathedral of Cremona: in 1823, he decorated the chapel of the Blessed Virgen del popolo; in 1825,  the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament;  and in 1826, he repainted the altarpiece of Annunziata, originally by Malosso.

41,692295,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley%20Fox,Charley Fox,"Charles William Fox, DFC
and Bar, CD  (b. February 26, 1920, Guelph, Ontario; d.October 18, 2008, Tillsonburg, Ontario) was a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II. He attended Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute.

Biography
Fox, the son of an Irish immigrant, joined the RCAF in 1939 at the beginning of the war (his brother Ted joined the Royal Canadian Artillery). He graduated near the top of his class in 1941 and was offered a job as a flight instructor in Dunnville, Ontario. He remained in this position until 1943 when he began combat training in Bagotville, Quebec. He flew Spitfires over Europe, destroying or damaging 153 enemy vehicles (mostly trains), and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (with bar).

In 1944, he began his tour of duty with the Canadian 412 Squadron. On D-Day he flew three patrols off the coast of France. On July 17, 1944, he flew from the Allied air base at Beny-sur-Mer in Normandy and strafed an unknown black car; he later learned that one of the passengers was German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who was seriously injured in the attack. This is disputed as an Australian and RAF (Chris Le Roux of 602 Squadron) pilot, and a French and RAF ( of 602 Squadron) pilot also claimed to have been responsible for the attack. Australian Fred Cowpe of 453 Squadron also claimed responsibility for the strafing attack, asserting that his guns' camera verified the assertion. He recorded this action in his aircraft log book. As Rommel was soon afterwards implicated in the assassination plot against Adolf Hitler, he was allowed to commit suicide and his death was announced as a result of injuries from the air attack. In 2004 Fox was officially credited with injuring Rommel, although he expressed regret about the attack, as Rommel was supposedly planning to secretly negotiate an earlier end to the war with the Allies.

Fox ended his tour of duty in January 1945, and served in the 420 Reserve after the war. He retired in 1956 and began to work at a shoe factory, from which he retired in 1998. On April 30, 2004, he was named honorary colonel of 412 Squadron in Ottawa, ultimately belonging to 8 Wing/CFB Trenton. For his long service in the RCAF, he was awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration.

He died in a car accident near Tillsonburg, Ontario, on October 18, 2008.

Legacy

Fourteen of Fox's planes were judged to be no longer usable after returning from missions due to excessive damage from enemy fire.

Charles Fox was noted as an educator of youth and spokesperson for veterans. He founded Torch Bearers, a non-profit organization aimed at educating young people about Canadian military exploits. He regularly took on speaking engagements to keep veterans' stories alive and fought with school boards to ensure Remembrance Day ceremonies were held annually.

According to Fox's family, he spent his life wondering why he survived numerous dates with death and was in the process of telling his story and those of other veterans in a book titled Why Not Me?, which the family hopes to finish. ""It did give him a purpose in life and he was searching for that,"" according to his son.

Mr. Fox had one son (James William Fox), two daughters (Susan Fox and Adrienne Black), nine grandchildren, three step-grandchildren, and fourteen great-grandchildren.

Early career 
Takagi was heavily influenced by his father, a touring car driver. In the early 1980s he began racing karts, competing in his first championship kart race in 1987. After winning several All Japan National Kart A2 series races, Takagi ended his kart racing career in 1991 and began racing Formula Toyota in 1992. In 1993, he began competing in All Japan Formula Three, finishing 10th in his rookie season.

Formula One

During his performance in a 1994 race he drew the attention of Japanese Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima, joining the Nakajima Racing team and competing in Formula 3000. He was heavily involved in the team from 1995 until he was chosen as Tyrrell's Formula One test driver in 1997.  He graduated to a race seat for . Takagi later competed with the Arrows Formula One team, and his European popularity was on the rise. However, there were organizational and communication problems between Takagi and both teams, and he left Formula One at the end of the  season.

Post–Formula One career
In 2000, Takagi joined Nakajima Racing's Formula Nippon team, earning eight victories in ten races, the most dominant performance ever by a driver in the series. He later competed in CART (Champ Car) for the Walker Racing team in 2001 and 2002 finishing in a career-best 4th place in Houston, Texas. He transferred to Indy Racing League and joined Mo Nunn Racing, finishing 10th in 2003. In the same year, he competed in the Indianapolis 500, starting in 7th place and finishing in 5th, earning him the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award.

After another, largely disappointing season in the IndyCar Series, Takagi returned to Japan in 2005 to compete in Formula Nippon once again, taking part ownership of the Cerumo team and running one of their cars in his own name (Takagi Planning with CERUMO).  Takagi also was one of the co-drivers of the #38 Toyota Supra Super GT car, claiming the series title along with Yuji Tachikawa. Takagi's title made him the first Super GT rookie to become champion in the GT500 class since John Nielsen and David Brabham in 1996, as well as the last until Jenson Button in 2018.

After Haydar's death, Mir Hussein bin Haydar came to power. He died two months later and was succeeded by Umar bin Haydar, who in 1827 was succeeded by Nasrullah.

Nasr-Allah bin Haydar Tora was ruler in a time when the Central Asian states were under pressure from the advance of the Russian Empire in the north and the British Indian Empire in the south. Nasr-Allah is best known in the West as the Emir who imprisoned and eventually executed in 1842 the British envoys Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly, and imprisoned but eventually released Joseph Wolff, who came in 1843 to seek news of them.

Emirate of Bukhara – Kokand Khanate wars
Nasrullah bin Haydar Tora organized several unsuccessful military campaigns against the Kokand Khanate. In 1839, he declared war against Kokand due to their building of the Pishagar fort near the Bukhara front. He conquered Khojand twice in 1839 and 1841, forcing the Khan of Kokand into a peace in his favour and took Ura Tepe and Khojend as compensation. The Khan of Kokand was also forced to pay a heavy amount and recognize him as lord, putting his name on the coins and the khutba. After a revolt in Khujent, the Emir's forces occupied Khojent and Kokand. Madali Khan, the Khan of Kokand, escaped to Marghilan, but was captured and executed in Bukhara at the end of April 1842. Nasrullah also personally ordered the execution of Ali-Khan and Nodira of Kokand along with most of their families. Bukharan forces in the Khanate of Kokand were expelled after a revolt in Kokand two months later.

Nasr-Allah bin Haydar Tora died in 1860 and his son Muzaffar bin Nasrullah (1860–1885) came to power.

51,38985936,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying%20arch,Flying arch,"A flying arch is a form of arch bridge that does not carry any vertical load, but is provided solely to supply outward horizontal forces, to resist an inwards compression. They are used across cuttings, to avoid them collapsing inwards.

Operation 
The conventional arch supports a vertical load downwards on the centre of the arch and translates this into forces both downwards and outwards at the base of the arch. In most cases, this sideways force is a nuisance and must be resisted by either strong foundations or a further 'bowstring' girder, in the form of a tied-arch bridge.

In some cases though, originally for railway cuttings in loose rock, the sides of the cutting are unable to retain their own weight and tend to slide inwards. Flying arches may be provided to retain these side walls. Unlike the conventional arch, the vertical load on the arch does not carry a useful load, it is merely used to generate the side-thrust, which in this case is useful for restraining the side walls.

Flying arches are not a common solution to railway cuttings. For large cuttings in soft earth, a gentle slope is self-supporting in most conditions. In small cuttings, retaining walls are a more common solution, although the thick masonry required to construct these soon becomes expensive. Flying arches were often used, as at Llansamlet, where an initial cutting of gentle slopes was later considered to be unreliably stable and the arches were then added as a safety measure.

Notable examples 
The first railway use of constructed flying arches was at Chorley, on the Bolton and Preston Railway, in 1841. These were a series of narrow 25 foot long, strut-like arches between two masonry retaining walls. The retaining walls constrained the side forces such that they could only act axially along the columns; between earth banks, such narrow arches would otherwise have been at risk of collapse from off-axis forces. In 2008 the original stone arches were replaced by steel during work to lower the running lines in order to create clearance for electrification work. The stone arches were subsequently restored atop the new steel structures in 2014.

The South Wales Railway at Llansamlet, near Swansea, runs through a cutting designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. After a landslip in the opening year of 1850, Brunel then designed four 70 foot flying arches to hold the cutting walls apart. For extra stability, these arches were ballasted with high mounds of copper slag, a dense waste product conveniently available locally. The four arches are now individually Grade II listed.

Just west of Swansea, the 829 yard Cockett Tunnel suffered a partial collapse in 1899, long after Brunel's death. Some time after reconstruction, the Eastern end of the tunnel was opened out (reducing the length to 788 yards) and the resulting cutting supported by two brick-built flying arches.

About 
In July 2020, after the international social movement of Black Lives Matter (BLM) and protests, a Henry Watkins Allen statue in Port Allen, created by local artist Angela Gregory was under debate over its historical significance. One side of the debate is the sculpture may need more context for it to hold any significance, since Allen was a former Confederate States Army military leader, the owner of the Allendale Plantation, and he had owned enslaved African Americans. On the other side of the debate, Henry Watkins Allen shaped Louisiana history and some say he should have more representation, even beyond the one monument by Gregory.

Henry Watkins Allen's connection to the city of his namesake, Port Allen was his residence at the Allendale Plantation.

Commissioned between 1985 and 1986, the station is located  from Muswellbrook, and  from Singleton in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia.

Prior to September 2014 Bayswater Power Station was part of NSW Government power producer, Macquarie Generation. Macquarie Generation was acquired by AGL Energy in September 2014.

History
The first generator was completed in 1985, and the remaining three generators progressively that same year and throughout 1986.

Bayswater draws its cooling water from the Hunter River under water entitlements negotiated with the government of New South Wales. The Barnard River Scheme also allows Bayswater and Liddell to transfer water from the upper Manning River catchment into the Hunter River for their use. Much of the coal is supplied by overland conveyors from mines it shares with the nearby Liddell Power Station.

Coal consumption is around  per annum and produces around  of electricity a year. This is enough power for 2 million average Australian homes and families.

Greenhouse emissions
Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates this power station emits 19.80 million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year as a result of burning coal. In 2010 the Australian Government announced the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to help combat climate change. It is expected to impact on emissions from power stations.  The National Pollutant Inventory provides details of a range of pollutant emissions, including CO, estimated at  for the year ending 30 June 2011.

In 2009, the power station was the subject of ""the first ever legal action aimed at curbing greenhouse gas pollution from a coal-fired power station"". Environmental activist Pete Gray went to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, asking it to find that the power station had been ""wilfully or negligently disposing of waste [...] by emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in a manner that has harmed or is likely to harm the environment in contravention of section 115(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997"", and sought an injunction against the station. The case, Gray and Anor v Macquarie Generation, was ongoing at the time of Gray's death from cancer in April 2011.

Mid-life upgrade
In December 2018, a proposed upgrade to the Bayswater Power Station was approved to be completed around the same time as the proposed closure of the Liddell Power Station in 2022. Both are owned by AGL Energy and consume coal from the same mine. The upgrade approval did not impose tighter air emission controls, however AGL claimed that the closure of Liddell would result in a net improvement in air quality. The upgrade will increase the rated capacity of three turbines on the four generating units, increasing the capacity of each unit by 25MW whilst slightly decreasing the amount of coal consumed.

 Wolfgang Dinzenhofer (1678-1747) from Plankenhäusel in Au near Aibling, did probably learn at another Wolfgang Dientzenhofer in Amberg, according to documents of the local Salesian monastery. Afterwards, he built several churches in Oberbayern, in Götting, Kirchdorf bei Nußdorf am Inn, Flintsbach etc.
 Christoph Dinzenhofer (1681-1722 in Prague) from Pfraundorf, was a cousin of the architect brothers, and also constructor
 In 1631, an Abraham Dintzenhofer is recorded in the ""Preßburger Bücher des ehrsamen Handwerks der Maurer- und Steinmetzen"", the records of the constructor guild in Bratislava

67,900224,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimedium,Epimedium,"Epimedium, also known as barrenwort, bishop's hat, fairy wings, horny goat weed, or yin yang huo (), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. The majority of the species are endemic to China, with smaller numbers elsewhere in Asia, and a few in the Mediterranean region.

Epimedium species are deciduous or evergreen hardy perennials. The majority have four-parted ""spider-like"" flowers in spring.

The species used as a dietary supplement is Epimedium grandiflorum. It contains icariin, which is a weak PDE5 inhibitor in vitro. Its clinical effects are unknown. There is little clinical evidence, but it is thought to have erectogenic properties and is found in some men's sexual health supplements.

Description

Species of Epimedium are herbaceous perennials, growing from an underground rhizome. Their growth habits are somewhat variable. Some have solitary stems, others have a ""tufted"" habit, with multiple stems growing close together. There may be several leaves to a stem or the leaves may be solitary, produced from the base of the plant. Individual leaves are generally compound, often with three leaflets, but also with more. Leaflets usually have spiny margins. The leaves may be annual, making the plant deciduous, or longer lasting, so that the plant is evergreen. The inflorescence is an open raceme or panicle, the number of flowers varying by species.

Individual flowers have parts in fours. There are four smaller outer sepals, usually greenish and shed when the flower opens. Moving inwards, these are followed by four larger petal-like inner sepals, often brightly coloured. Inside the sepals are four true petals. These may be small and flat, but often have a complex shape including a nectar-producing ""spur"" that may be longer than the sepals. There are four stamens.

One of the common names for the genus, bishop's hat, arises from the shape of the flowers, particularly where the spurs are longer than the sepals.

Taxonomy

The genus was given its name by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in describing the European species E. alpinum. The name is a latinized version of a Greek name for an unidentifiable plant, epimedion, that is mentioned in Pliny's Natural History (xxvii.57). The meaning of the original name is unclear.

accepted species (65)

Hybrids

Some artificial hybrids are cultivated in gardens. These include:

E. × cantabrigiense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pubigerum
E. × perralchicum Stearn, hybrid between E. perralderianum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum
E. × rubrum Morr., hybrid between E. alpinum and E. grandiflorum
E. × versicolor Morr., hybrid between E. grandiflorum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum
E. × warleyense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum
E. × youngianum Fisch & C.A.Mey, hybrid between E. diphyllum and E. grandiflorum

Cultivation

Some varieties and hybrids have been in Western cultivation for the last 100 to 150 years. There is now a wide array of new Chinese species being cultivated in the West, many of which have only recently been discovered, and some of which have yet to be named. There are also many older Japanese hybrids and forms, extending the boundaries of the genus in cultivation. The majority of the Chinese species have not been fully tested for hardiness nor indeed for any other aspect of their culture. The initial assumption that the plants would only thrive where their native conditions could be closely replicated have proven to be overly cautious, as most varieties are proving extraordinarily amenable to general garden and container cultivation.

The cultivar 'Amber Queen' is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Propagation
While they can be successfully propagated in early spring, epimediums are best divided in late summer, with the aim of promoting rapid re-growth of roots and shoots before the onset of winter. Several breeders (in particular Darrell Diano Probst, Tim Branney & Robin White) have also undertaken their own hybridization programmes with the genus.  Various new nursery selections are gradually appearing in the horticulture trade, the best of which extend the colour and shape range of the flowers available to the gardener.

Chemistry 
Epimedium wushanense contains a number of flavonoids. 37 compounds were characterized from the underground and aerial parts of the plant. Among them, 28 compounds were prenylflavonoids. The predominant flavonoid, epimedin C, ranged from 1.4 to 5.1% in aerial parts and 1.0 to 2.8% in underground parts.

It is composed of discussions and examples on offensive and defensive strategies from a wide variety of people and conditions, applying them to social conflicts such as family quarrels and business negotiations.

Reception 
The Independent said Greene has set himself up as ""a modern-day Machiavelli"" but that ""it is never clear whether he really believes what he writes or whether it is just his shtick, an instrument of his will to shift £20 hardbacks."" and concludes ""There is something less than adult about it all."" Admiral James G. Stavridis said the book had good breadth, but it lacked depth. Leadership theorist and author John Adair said Greene ""shows a poor grasp of the subject"" and the book is based on the flawed ""assumption that the art of military strategy and the art of living are comparable"". Booklist said the book was repetitive, lacked a sense of humor, and had an annoying ""quasi-spiritual tone"". NBA player Chris Bosh stated that his favorite book is The 33 Strategies of War. 
The 33 Strategies of War was part of the reading list for youths attending the Indigenous Leadership Forum organised by the University of Victoria, which aimed to redesign radical Indigenous politics and the Indigenist movement. It is also read by students attending a Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary course in Christian apologetics.  The book has been banned by several US prisons.

In the book Greene writes that ""Afghanistan was rich in natural gas and other minerals and had ports on the Indian Ocean"": Afghanistan is land-locked. (Trade to and from Afghanistan uses ports in other countries, such as Chabahar Port in Iran.) The political tales in the book are said to be ""mostly foolish or just plain wrong"".

The book has ""far too many duff sentences"", for example: ""Your goal is to blend philosophy and war, wisdom and battle, into an unbeatable blend.""

It has sold more than 200,000 copies.

71,23739032,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface%20Paradise,Surface Paradise,"Surface Paradise is the second full-length album by Australian rock band Root!, released on 24 July 2009. The album follows the previous year's EP release Get Up Yourself, of which several references are made to. Continuing the band's more rock-oriented explorations since their debut, the album features several recurring motifs, both musical and lyrical and can be considered a loose concept album. The album's concept is that of the fictional, and perhaps metaphorical, 'Surface Paradise', which is most specifically referred to in the album's title tracks. The paradise itself is directly mentioned as a being like a supermarket, yet it is likely to be a non-physical place, where the world's trendy and elite are seen to reside.

The album features extensive liner notes, tying into the album's conceptual themes. Rather than featuring any traditional descriptions of the songs, the notes are exhibited as several pages taken from a book. The book appears to deal with the band's self-titled 'Root' character, as well as the characters 'The Unit' and 'Tyfani'. In addition to the full-length album, early runs of the CD are accompanied by a bonus disc of early Root! demos. This disc, titled First Root!, is accompanied by its own set of liner notes which detail the band's formation and early years.

The museum has a collection of some 46,000 works, which range from late-Gothic paintings and sculptures to 16th century local artists such as Jan Rombouts the Elder and Josse van der Baren to 19th-century paintings and sculptures by various Flemish masters including Constantin Meunier, Jef Lambeaux and George Minne.

History

M – Museum Leuven continues the municipal museum operations that started in the early 19th century. In 1823, the first museum was founded on the second floor of the Leuven City Hall. About one century later, the collection was moved to the former private residence of the mayor Leopold Vander Kelen in the historic center of Leuven.  This location is now the principal exhibition space of M Museum.

Before it was opened in 2009, the M Museum building was renovated after a design by Belgian architect Stéphane Beel.  The design integrates historical features and sleek contemporary architecture around a pretty courtyard. The total area of the museum is 13,500 square meters.

In addition to its exhibition space, the museum building houses the M-café, the M-shop, an auditorium, a children's workshop, a courtyard and workshop spaces.

Permanent collection and exhibitions
M Museum manages the art collection, which is the property of the city of Leuven. This collection has grown from what originally was an 18th-century room of curiosities. Through gifts, the art collection grew into a full-fledged collection offering an overview of the art production in Leuven and Brabant from the Middle Ages to the present.

The historical collection of M has as its core paintings and objects from the late Gothic period (15th and 16th century) and a collection of 19th century paintings.  The M collection includes masterpieces by Dirk Bouts, Rogier van der Weyden, Constantin Meunier, Jef Lambeaux and others. M is also a platform for discovering contemporary art as the collection includes painting, sculpture, photography, video, film and architecture.

The museum organises many activities throughout the year such as themed exhibitions, family Sundays, children's workshops, tours, lectures, book presentations and framework of the exhibition offer.

81,40371358,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoluments%20attachment%20orders%20in%20South%20Africa,Emoluments attachment orders in South Africa,"An emoluments attachment order in South African law is a court order whereby the judgment creditor is able to attach part of the salary or wages of the judgment debtor. Once an emoluments attachment order has been granted, the employer of the judgment debtor (who is referred to as the garnishee) is obliged (on a continuing basis, and until such time as the judgment debt has been paid in full) to pay a certain portion of the judgment debtor's salary or wages to the judgment creditor.

The employer is known as the emoluments attachment debtor or garnishee. It is important to distinguish between the employer as an emoluments attachment order debtor, or garnishee, and the actual judgment debtor. Emoluments attachment orders are signed by the judgment creditor, or by a nominated attorney, as well as by the clerk, and are served by the sheriff on the emoluments attachment debtor or garnishee. An emoluments attachment order may be executed against the emoluments attachment debtor or garnishee as if it were a judgment of the court. The order is always subject to the rights of the judgment debtor, emoluments attachment debtor or any interested party to dispute the validity or correctness of the order.

The emoluments attachment order “is a good way of proceeding against a judgment debtor who does not possess sufficient attachable assets to pay off a significant portion of the debt.” Because the money goes directly from the employer to the judgment creditor, the latter's attorney does not have to worry about the judgment debtor spending it before it can be attached. The judgment debtor also has an interest in retaining his job. As long as he does so, the debt will continue to be paid.

When to apply 
Application for an emoluments attachment order may be made when

 the court has suspended the execution of an order or warrant for the imprisonment of a judgment debtor in terms of section 65F(2), pending the payment by the judgment debtor of the judgment debt and costs in specific instalments as determined in the suspension order; or
 the court has ordered a judgment debtor to pay the judgment debt and costs in specified instalments, as determined in the order; or
 the judgment debt remains unpaid despite the fact that the judgment debtor has served the term of his or her imprisonment or periodical imprisonment by the court due to a failure to comply with the order; or
 the judgment debtor consented thereto in writing; or
 a court has authorised it.

Jurisdiction 
Application for an emoluments attachment order may be made from the court of the district wherein the employer (that is, the garnishee) resides, carries on business or is employed; or alternatively, where the judgment debtor is employed by the State, the court of the district wherein the judgment debtor is so employed by the State.

Requirements 
In terms of section 65J(2)(a) and (b), an emoluments attachment order will not be issued

 unless the judgment debtor has consented thereto in writing, or the court has so authorised and does not suspend the authorisation;
 unless the judgment creditor or an appointed attorney has
 sent a registered letter to the judgment debtor at his or her last known address informing the judgment debtor of the amount of the judgment debt and the costs which remain unpaid, and also warning that an emoluments attachment order will be issued if the mentioned amount is not paid within seven days after the date on which that registered letter has been posted; and
 filed with the clerk an affidavit or affirmation wherein is indicated
 the amount of the judgment debt on the date of the order laying down the specific instalments;
 the costs, if any, incurred since that date; and
 the balance owing; and
 it is declared that the provision above, requiring the sending of the registered letter, have been complied with on the date specified therein.

Once the emoluments attachment order has been issued and served on the emoluments attachment debtor or garnishee, a certain amount will be deducted from the judgment debtor's salary by the garnishee at the end of every month, and paid over to the judgment creditor. The garnishee is entitled to deduct a five per cent commission for this service.

The court may on good cause suspend, amend or rescind the order, especially where the judgment debtor can show that, after the deduction, there are insufficient means available to support the judgment debtor and any dependants. Where the judgment debtor leaves the employment of the garnishee, the judgment debtor must advise the judgment creditor of the name and address of the new employer. The judgment creditor may then serve a certified copy of the order, together with a certificate of the balance of the debt owed, on the new employer. The new employer, as the new garnishee, is then bound by the order.

Difference between emoluments attachment order and garnishee order 
In terms of the procedure adopted in the Magistrates’ Courts, there is a distinction between emoluments attachment orders (which relate to the attachment of the salary or wages owing or accruing to the judgment debtor by a third party), and garnishee orders (which relate to the attachment of all the other kinds of debts which may be owed to the judgment debtor by a third party).

In essence, an emoluments attachment order is a procedure whereby a debt may be collected from a judgment debtor. The order is served on the debtor's employer (the garnishee), who is instructed to make regular weekly or monthly deductions from the debtor's salary and to pay these deductions over to the judgment creditor.

A garnishee order, on the other hand, allows a judgment creditor to attach a money debt owed to the judgment debtor by a third party. The order is served on the third party and attaches money owed by the third party (who is also known as a garnishee) to the judgment debtor. The third party or garnishee is then obliged to hand over to the judgment creditor directly as much of the attached money debt as is necessary to satisfy the judgment debt and costs.

History

The area has been inhabited since ancient times (Paleolithic stone tools were found here). Edelény was first mentioned in 1299, but the village of Borsod, which was annexed to the town in the 20th century, was already mentioned in 1108 (Borsod comitatus belonged to the castle of Borsod in the Middle Ages).

The residents of Edelény worked in agriculture in mediaeval times. During the Turkish occupation of Hungary, the town was deserted several times.

In the 19th century, industry became more important in the area. In 1838, a sugar factory was built, and a brown coal mine was opened. The Jewish population (1910: 8.3%; 1941: 7.9%) was deported and murdered in early June 1944.

Two nearby villages were annexed to Edelény: Borsod in 1950, and Finke in 1963. Edelény got town status in 1986.

Twin towns – sister cities

Edelény is twinned with:
 Bad Sobernheim, Germany
 Moldava nad Bodvou, Slovakia
 Siewierz, Poland

84,45152343,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just%20Cause%20%28video%20game%20series%29,Just Cause (video game series),"Just Cause is an action-adventure video game series created by Avalanche Studios, which was formerly owned by Eidos Interactive and after 2009 by Square Enix Europe. The series consists of Just Cause, Just Cause 2, Just Cause 3, and Just Cause 4. The games are open world and primarily take place in islands and archipelagos. Each game in the series tasks the player by giving them tools (such as the parachute, grappling hook and wingsuit) to overthrow a governing body in the game's setting. By June 2018, the series had shipped over 15 million copies worldwide.

The series directly draws its name from the real-life United States invasion of Panama, code-named ""Operation Just Cause"".

Overview
Each installment in the series takes place on a fictional island nation situated throughout the real world, where the player plays the character Rico Rodriguez, a secret agent who originally hails from the fictional nation of Medici (featured in the third game). On foot, Rico is capable of many actions. These include walking, swimming, jumping, as well as operating weapons. Players can also take control of vehicles found in the world and perform stunts while driving them. Players can also utilize Rico's grappling hook, parachute, and wingsuit (from the third game onwards) to travel around the map. 

During the game, the player is given a  story and side missions, where the player has to gain points with certain factions. When not playing story or side missions, the player can free-roam in the open world and create chaos. However, doing so will attract a ""heat"" level (similar to Grand Theft Auto's Wanted Level), which increases based on the resistance and the amount of enemies, who try to stop the player using fatal methods.

The player can also play several optional side missions, such as liberating a village or taking over a drug cartel's villa. In Just Cause, these missions are repetitive but necessary to gain points with certain factions. In Just Cause 2, the side missions became unique and more complex.

Games

Just Cause (2006)

The core gameplay consists of elements of a third-person shooter and a driving game, with a large open environment to move around in. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, swimming and jumping, as well as utilizing weapons and basic hand-to-hand combat. Players can take control of a variety of vehicles, including cars, boats, airplanes, helicopters and motorcycles. Players can also perform stunts with their cars in which they can stand on the roof and jump to another car, or choose to open their parachute whilst still in motion on the roof. Other key features of the game include parasailing (grappling onto a moving vehicle while utilizing a parachute) and skydiving. Just Cause is set off the island nation of San Esperito (inspired by the Caribbean).

The open, non-linear environment allows players to explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game, players can complete them at their own leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, players can free-roam, cause chaos or partake in a variety of optional side missions.

Just Cause 2 (2010)

Just Cause 2 is an action-adventure game with one of the largest game maps ever. All gameplay is in an open world/sandbox and most missions can be done in various creative ways. The game is set on the fictional country of Panau (which is off of Southeast Asia), an archipelago ruled by Pandak 'Baby' Panay.

Originally set to be released in 2008, it was pushed back multiple times until it was released on March 23, 2010, in North America and March 26, 2010, in Europe.

Just Cause 3 (2015)

Just Cause 3 was released worldwide on December 1, 2015. The game is set on the fictional Mediterranean island of Medici, where it is run by dictator Di Ravello. Along with a larger map than Just Cause 2, there is the added feature of a wingsuit to be used by the main character, Rico Rodriguez.

In comparison to Just Cause 2, the storyline is longer, but there are no faction side-missions. However, there are now Random Encounters (which can re-occur) and more types of races and other challenges.

The game allows players to shoot their way through walls, and expanded destruction features.

Just Cause 4 (2018)

Just Cause 4 is the latest game in the Just Cause series, released on December 4, 2018 The game is set in the fictional South American country of Solís. The new dynamic weather systems expand upon the function of the wingsuit introduced in Just Cause 3 and are the focus of the storyline.

In comparison to Just Cause 3, the map is much larger and more diverse, however, the removal of it's liberation mechanic does reduce the need to visit large portions of the map.

Just Cause Mobile (2022) 
Just Cause Mobile was officially announced by Square Enix during The Game Awards for iOS and Android mobile devices. It is a free-to-play action shooter game set in the Just Cause universe featuring single-player and multiplayer four player co-op and PvP gameplay for up to thirty players. While the console and PC games are third-person affairs, the mobile take on the franchise will feature a top-down isometric perspective. The game is scheduled to globally release in 2022.

Reception 
The Just Cause series has received a mixed reception from critics, but audiences generally have given the series a positive reception. Critics and audiences alike praise the series for its innovative gameplay, open-world design, set-pieces and non-linear approach to mission structure, however it is generally criticised by critics and audiences for its generic storyline and cliché characters.

Film adaptation
In 2010, it was reported that a movie adaptation of Just Cause, titled Just Cause: Scorpion Rising, was in production, written by comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill. Nothing came of these plans, and Hill's Just Cause: Scorpion Rising was never produced.

In 2015, Adrian Askarieh, producer of the Hitman films, stated that he hoped to oversee a shared universe of Square Enix films with Just Cause, Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, and Thief, but admitted that he does not have the rights to Tomb Raider. He also stated, at that time, that the latest outlook for the Just Cause film was that it would be based on the third release of the video game series. In May 2017, the Game Central reporters at Metro UK suggested that the shared universe was unlikely, pointing out that no progress had been made on any Just Cause, Deus Ex nor Thief films.

In March 2017, it was announced that Jason Momoa would play Rico Rodriguez and Brad Peyton would direct the movie. , Peyton admitted that no script existed yet, and that he and Momoa already had full schedules well into 2019. On May 21, 2019, it was announced that Derek Kolstad would write the film. On July 15, 2020, it was announced that Michael Dowse would direct the film, which is produced by Constantin Film and Askarieh's Prime Universe.

85,19364294,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibrated%20geometry,Calibrated geometry,"In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a calibrated manifold is a Riemannian manifold (M,g) of dimension n equipped with a differential p-form φ (for some 0 ≤ p ≤ n) which is a calibration, meaning that:
 φ is closed: dφ = 0, where d is the exterior derivative
 for any x ∈ M and any oriented p-dimensional subspace ξ of TxM, φ|ξ = λ volξ with λ ≤ 1. Here volξ is the volume form of ξ with respect to g.
Set Gx(φ) = { ξ as above : φ|ξ = volξ }. (In order for the theory to be nontrivial, we need  Gx(φ) to be nonempty.) Let G(φ) be the union of Gx(φ) for x in M.

The theory of calibrations is due to R. Harvey and B. Lawson and others. Much earlier (in 1966) Edmond Bonan introduced G2-manifold and  Spin(7)-manifold, constructed all the parallel forms and showed that those manifolds were Ricci-flat. Quaternion-Kähler manifold were simultaneously studied  in 1967 by Edmond Bonan and Vivian Yoh Kraines and they constructed the parallel 4-form.

Calibrated submanifolds

A p-dimensional submanifold Σ of M is said to be a calibrated submanifold with respect to φ (or simply φ-calibrated) if TΣ lies in G(φ).

A famous one line argument shows that calibrated p-submanifolds minimize volume within their homology class. Indeed, suppose that Σ is calibrated, and Σ ′ is a p submanifold in the same homology class. Then

where the first equality holds because Σ is calibrated, the second equality is Stokes' theorem (as φ is closed), and the inequality holds because φ is a calibration.

Examples

 On a Kähler manifold, suitably normalized powers of the Kähler form are calibrations, and the calibrated submanifolds are the complex submanifolds.  This follows from the Wirtinger inequality.
 On a Calabi–Yau manifold, the real part of a holomorphic volume form (suitably normalized) is a calibration, and the calibrated submanifolds are special Lagrangian submanifolds.
 On a G2-manifold, both the 3-form and the Hodge dual 4-form define calibrations. The corresponding calibrated submanifolds are called associative and coassociative submanifolds.
 On a Spin(7)-manifold, the defining 4-form, known as the Cayley form, is a calibration. The corresponding calibrated submanifolds are called Cayley submanifolds.

But it was actually done in Besant Theosophical College, Madanapalle, where Tagore stayed for few days in February 1919 that the now familiar tune was set. It was Margaret Cousins, wife of educationist, Dr. James Henry Cousins, who composed the tune for ""Jana Gana Mana"".

87,51349357,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grzegorz%20%C5%9Alak,Grzegorz Ślak,"Grzegorz Andrzej Ślak (born 16 May 1965 in Ostrzeszów) - Polish entrepreneur, lawyer (specializing in excise duties), financier.

Career 
Ślak started his career at Bank Przemysłowo-Handlowy in Rybnik, where he was involved mainly in financing and restructuring energy, steel and mining-related companies.

In 2002 he became the President of the Management Board of Rafineria Trzebinia.

As the first person in Poland, he has ""built"" a facility for producing higher fatty acid methyl esters ('biofuels') and pharmaceutical glycerine, thus becoming ""the pioneer of Polish biofuels"".

In 2005, he ""built"" the first plant for hydrorefining of purified paraffin in Central and Eastern Europe under license by Exxon Mobil. The plant allowed for use of petroleum processing products (paraffin) in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries.

In 2005, he developed a new technology and started to produce a new fuel, trade name ""ON BIO 10"", consisting of diesel oil and 20% addition of higher fatty acid methyl esters. On this basis, the Minister of Economy adopted the quality standard for this fuel which is still in effect. For this product, Rafineria Trzebinia was awarded the Promotional Emblem “Teraz Polska” in 2006.

In June 2006, Ślak was accused of reducing the payable excise duties for the unprecedented amount of PLN 760 million in connection with his duties as the President of the Management Board of Rafineria Trzebinia. After two years, tax authorities confirmed accuracy of the settlements, thus accepting correctness of the tax rate applied by Ślak.

In 2006, he became the President of the Management Board of Skotan S.A., leading the company to one of its biggest stock increases on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

In 2008, he became the President of the Management Board of Bioeton S.A. In this company, he carried out a capital investment which allowed for the takeover of BDK Kyritz GmbH, a German renewable energy company. In 2009, he became the President of the Management Board of BDK Kyritz GmbH in Germany. Ślak restructured the company, which involved restoring its financial liquidity. At that time, the company was in the state of so-called ""temporary bankruptcy"".

In July 2011 he took up the position of the President of the Management Board of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A.,  a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group, which produces methyl esters and higher fatty acids (biodiesel), as well as raw and pharmaceutical glycerine. At the time of Ślak's taking up of the position, the company had not been operating due to a lack of contracts. As a result of his restructuring, Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A. generated a 7-digit net profit for the year 2012. At the same time, Ślak carried out an investment in bioethanol dehydrated spirit production plant, thus expanding the company's economic activity. The successful restructuring enabled the company to begin an application process for entering the stock market at the beginning of 2015.

As the President of the Management Board and a shareholder of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A., he has been carrying out works to build a plant for producing algae fuels (third-generation fuels). If successful, it will be the first plant of this sort in Europe.

Since October 2011, Ślak has been simultaneously holding the post of the President of the Management Board of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. (also a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group) - a producer of spirits and vodkas. At the time of Ślak's taking up of the position, the company had fulfilled all the legal requirements to file for bankruptcy.

In 2012, his actions resulted in signing agreements with world-scale alcohol producers: one with Brown-Forman (the owner of Jack Daniels and Finlandia brands) for the production of Maximus vodka and another with Diageo (the owner of Johnnie Walker and Baileys) for the production of Smirnoff vodka. As a result of the financial restructuring, the company is planning to enter the stock market in 2016.

As part of the restructuring process, Ślak carried out an investment in Poland's most modern alcohol production line licensed by CFT Packaging S.A. The line is able to produce 100 million bottles a year, which increases the overall productivity of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. to 150 million bottles a year, thus placing the company among the biggest alcohol producers in Central-Eastern Europe.

In 2013, he replaced the deceased Aleksander Gudzowaty as the President of the Management Board of Bartimpex S.A.

Ślak is the President of the Management Board and a shareholder of HGBS Finanse S.A, a fund investing in new technology and ""excise business"" enterprises.

In his career, he has been or is a member of the following supervisory boards (among others): Orlen Oil S.A, J.W. Construction S.A., Orlen Asfalt S.A, Polonia Warszawa S.A., Euronaft Sp. z o.o.

Dispute over the offset agreement 
In April 2003, the Polish government signed an agreement with the U.S. for purchase of 48 F-16 jets for US$3.5 million. In exchange, the Americans agreed, among others, to invest in Poland's economy and help Polish enterprises to invest in the American market. They failed to fulfill the latter point. In 2014, carrying out the duties of the President of Bartimpex Management Board, Grzegorz Ślak led the company to reach a settlement with Lockheed Martin under which the Polish company was awarded several million dollars in damages. Bartimpex was the only legal entity in Poland to have been awarded damages for the unfulfilled offset agreement conditions.

The Yamal–Europe gas pipeline 
Grzegorz Ślak initiated the PGNiG takeover of the part of the Yamal–Europe gas pipeline that goes through Poland. The transaction enabled PGNiG to take over 4% of the shares, which gave it advantage over Gazprom (52% to 48%) and guaranteed the Polish party the decisive vote on the most significant matters concerning EuropolGaz, the owner of the pipeline.

Awards 
He was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit for contributions to the development of oil industry pursuant to the Polish President's Decree of 4 June 2003.

He received ""Man of the year 2005"" Medal awarded by Gazeta Krakowska for ""professionalism in company management, introducing innovative technologies, effectiveness in winning new markets and supporting culture and sport"".

Community involvement 
He funded two ultrasound devices which allow for earlier cancer detection for the Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases and Occupational Hypertension of University Teaching Hospital in Wrocław.

He funded a gamma camera used for an effective thyroid examination for the Department of Endocrinology in Zabrze.

He funded a device which facilitates performing cancer surgery in children for the Department of Pediatric Surgery and Urology of Wrocław Medical University.

Hobbies 
Ślak is an avid enthusiast of football and motorcycle speedway. In 2004 and 2005, he led the speedway team Unia Tarnów to its first in history title of the winner of Team Speedway Polish Championship.

For many years, he has been connected with Polish speedway rider Tomasz Gollob, who officially handed the 2010 gold medal for winning Individual Speedway World Championship over to Ślak. In 2010, he also wrote a book, entitled Why only now?! Gollob as the world champion. A true story.

In 2008, he carried out a capital transaction which led to the takeover of Groclin Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wlkp. by the shareholder of J.W. As a result, the club changed its name to Polonia Warszawa and the registered seat to the city of Warsaw. It was the first transaction of this sort and so far one of a kind on the top level of Polish football events.

He acts as a speedway expert and Grand Prix commentator on Canal+.

The school operated from its founding in 1874 until the mid-1970s.  Its campus, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, housed a variety of state offices, and a state Department of Corrections pre-release center until 2003 when the state put the complex up for sale and began moving offices off campus. The site remained unsold until 2016, when it was purchased by Mastway Development, LLC of Winthrop, Maine. Since then the main building has been completely renovated to serve as a 36 bed student dormitory for the University of Maine at Augusta which opened in August of 2019.

Description and history
The former Maine Industrial School for Girls campus is located just northwest of downtown Hallowell, on the north side of Winthrop Street.  It occupies about , set on an east-facing hillside overlooking the downtown and the Kennebec River beyond.  The campus buildings are generally rectangular brick structures, aligned with the long axis running north-south.  They are organized around a central grassy area.  The oldest surviving building, located near the southeastern edge of the campus, dates to 1898.  The most prominent buildings are the former Central Building (1917–19) on the east side of the green, and Stevens Hall (1936–38) on the west side.  Most of the buildings have some measure of Colonial Revival styling, although the 1898 Baker Building has an Italianate corbelled cornice.  The 1905-06 Administration was designed by Lewiston architect William R. Miller.

The school was established by an act of the state legislature in 1874, as a place where ""wayward girls"" could be given a proper moral education, in a facility similar to one that had previously been established for boys.  It was roughly modeled on the Lancaster Industrial School for Girls in Massachusetts.  The school was at first considered to be a nominally secure educational facility or reform school, and not a correctional facility.  This view evolved over time, and by the time of its closure in the 1970s it was viewed more as a penal institution.

The school's earliest buildings were either destroyed by fire or torn down.  Following the school's closure, its buildings were repurposed by the state to house offices of some of its departments.  The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Following closure of the Stevens School in the mid-1970s, the buildings were repurposed for state offices until 2003 when state put the complex up for sale and began moving offices off campus. The site remained unsold until 2016, when it was purchased by Mastway Development, LLC. By this time, most of the long vacant buildings, considered an eyesore by the community, has suffered from neglect and considerable deferred maintenance. The Administration Building was the first rehabilitation project to be completed at the Stevens School campus in 2018 using state and federal historic tax credits. The building is now professional office space on the first floor with four apartments filling the upper stories. In 2018 Mastway Development also collaborated with the City to site and build a new Hallowell Fire Station on the campus. The City of Hallowell has contributed to the rehabilitation of the campus with more than a half million dollars in infrastructure improvements funded by a citizen-supported bond issue. 

Erskine Hall, sitting at the head of the common green will house the second student housing building for University of Maine at Augusta with accommodations for 47 more students in the Fall of 2020. The former dormitory building is being converted into new apartments with classic finishes and modern amenities, porches, patios and student lounges. This building abuts Stevens Hall which currently houses 36 students from the University of Maine at Augusta. Next door to Erskine Hall is the Central Commons building which will boast 29 new apartments through CHOM, Community Housing of Maine’s affordable senior housing project opening in 2020. Behind Erskine Hall is the Flagg Dummer building, which is under development for housing.

There are forty-nine full-time academic staff and over one thousand students. The current Head of the School of Law is Professor Jane Mair.

The 2019 Complete University Guide league rankings placed Glasgow at 2nd in the UK while the 2019 rankings from The Guardian placed Glasgow at ninth in the UK. The 2018 The Times league rankings placed Glasgow at 4th in the UK.

History
At the University's foundation in 1451, there were four original faculties: Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. Both Canon and Civil Law were taught, however by the sixteenth Century, instruction in both of these had fallen out of practice. It was during this time that James Dalrymple of Stair came to Glasgow to study for an MA (1633–1637) and then became a regent (1641–1647) teaching philosophy. He went on to become Lord President of the Court of Session in 1671, and published his Institutions of the Law of Scotland in 1681, the first systematic exposition of Scots Law. The Stair Building, where the School of Law is housed, is named in his honour.

In 1713, Queen Anne endowed the Regius Chair of Law at the University. The first occupant of the Chair (from 1714) was William Forbes, and subsequent notable Professors have included John Millar, William Gloag, David Walker and Joe Thomson. This revived the teaching of Law at Glasgow, and subsequent Chairs included the Chair of Conveyancing, established in 1861 by the Faculty of Procurators; the Douglas Chair of Civil Law in 1948; the Chair in Jurisprudence (1952); in Public Law (1965); and the John Millar Chair of Law in 1985, named for the previously mentioned Regius Professor of Law.

In 1984, the Faculty of Law became the Faculty of Law and Financial Studies, and in 1992, the individual legal departments were grouped together into the School. In 2005, the Faculty merged with the Faculty of Social Sciences, becoming the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences. On 1 August 2010 the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Science was combined with the Adam Smith Business School, the School of Social and Political Studies, the School of Education and the School of Interdisciplinary Studies into a new College of Social Sciences.

Academia

The School of Law is housed in the Stair Building (named for Viscount Stair), a row of internally connected terraced houses on The Square opposite the University Chapel. The School is associated with traditional Scots law teaching and with internationally recognised research across a wide range of subjects including Corporate Law and Financial Regulation, Intellectual Property Law, and Law and Security.

CREATe

CREATe is the RCUK research centre for copyright and new business models in the creative economy. With an ambitious programme of 40 projects delivered by an interdisciplinary team of academics (law, cultural economics, management, computer science, sociology, psychology, ethnography and critical studies), the centre is a pioneering academic initiative designed to help the UK cultural and creative industries thrive and become innovation leaders within the global digital economy. CREATe will examine the business, regulatory and cultural infrastructure of the cultural and creative industries by exploring cutting-edge questions around digitisation, copyright, and innovation in the arts and technology. The University of Glasgow, leads a consortium of 7 Universities which also comprises the University of East Anglia, the University of Edinburgh, Goldsmiths (University of London), University of Nottingham, University of St Andrews and the University of Strathclyde. CREATe is supported by £5m of funding over four years (2012-2016) from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).

Students
Students in the School of Law elect class representatives from each of their classes to represent them at meetings of committees within the School of Law. The School comes within the College of Social Science constituency on the Students' Representative Council.

Law Society
The Glasgow University Law Society organises social activities for students at the School of Law, including the annual Law Ball, held every February. The event is of a comparable size to the GUSA Ball, and because of the number of students attending it is necessary to hold the event in city centre hotels as there is no hall in the University large enough to accommodate it. The Society co-ordinate various different events, focusing around being either social, academic or charity, headed by their respective Convenor. Membership is open to all students of the School of Law, and the Society is affiliated to the SRC.

The Society publishes the Glasgow University Law Review, an annual publication containing legal articles written by members of the Society.

Mooting
The School of Law has a student-run Mooting Society, which runs an internal competition, The Dean's Cup, as well as organising the Alexander Stone National Legal Debate. All Scottish universities offering the LLB are entitled to enter this, although the competition is generally between Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Strathclyde universities. The final is held in February or March each year in the Alexander Stone Court Room on the ground floor of the Stair Building. University of Strathclyde currently holds the trophy.

The Sheriff's Cup, organised by Glasgow Sheriff Court, is an inter-varsity event held between Glasgow and Strathclyde and judged by a Senator of the College of Justice. The moot is held annually and takes place in one of the larger court rooms at Glasgow Sheriff Court.  The team of Craig MacLeod and Christopher Rae led Glasgow to victory in 2016, with the moot judged by Lord Matthews.

96,12286627,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eriodictyon%20angustifolium,Eriodictyon angustifolium,"Eriodictyon angustifolium, common name narrowleaf yerba santa, is a perennial shrub.

The plant is native to pinyon-juniper woodland habits of western North American deserts. It is found in the Mojave Desert in California, Nevada, & Utah; and in Baja California.

Description
Eriodictyon angustifolium has toothed leaves, about 10 centimeters in length, that are sticky above and hairy below.

The white, five-petaled flowers are in bloom in June &/or July.

Distribution 
In Baja California, this plant is found growing in the foothills of the Sierra de Juarez and the Sierra de San Pedro Martir, but it can be found growing further south on the sky islands of the Sierra de la Asamblea and the Sierra de San Borja.

Uses 
Eriodictyon angustifolium extract, but not Eriodictyon californicum extract, reduces human hair greying. Sterubin is the most abundant flavonoid in Eriodictyon angustifolium extract.

Dietary eriodictyon angustifolium tea supports prevention of hair graying by reducing DNA damage in CD34+ hair follicular keratinocyte stem cells.

It is in a corner of Inokashira Park near the Ghibli Museum. A branch of the zoo is in Mitaka. It opened on May 17, 1942.

Overview 
Large animals, such as the Asian elephant Hanako, were bred until 2016. Other animals, such as the Japanese serow and raccoon, are still bred.  In 2006,  to reduce the risk of breeding, the Ministry of the Environment moved some endangered Tsushima leopard cats to the zoo.  Breeding restarted on February 22, 2008.

It is divided into a main zoo in Gotenyama, Musashino and a branch location in Inokashira, Mitaka. In the main park, mainly mammals and birds are raised, and water birds are kept in the garden surrounded by Inokashira pond. Also, there is a cultural museum, where special exhibitions and lectures or meetings are held. There was also a ""tropical bird greenhouse"", but on June 2, 2013 it closed due to its age. There is an aquarium with fish and amphibians in the secondary park.

A sculpture garden is in one corner of the park with works by Seibo Kitamura.  In addition, a small amusement park (a merry-go round, teacups, train) is in another corner of the park.

Smoking has been banned at the zoo, as of July 5, 2018.

History 
In September 1905, Shibusawa Eiichi borrowed a corner of Inokashira Gotenyama Garden from the Imperial Family and founded the Tokyo Maternity Hospital Conversion Division (later Inokashira School) to accommodate juvenile delinquents. On May 1, 1917, the entire town was granted to Tokyo and Inokashira Park was opened. On May 5, 1934, ""Nakanoshima small animal zoo"" opened at the current branch location.

In 1939, when the Inokashira school relocated, the plan to build a big zoo in this area was advanced. Initially it was conceived as ""a big zoo"" comparable to the Ueno Zoo, but due to the wartime budget and supplies shortage, large animals can not be gathered. The plan changed to a ""nature observation park"". It opened on May 17, 1942.

Two giraffes were bred at the time of the opening, but both died by the end of the war.

Hanako 

Hanako (1947–2018) was a female Asian elephant that was kept at Inokashira Park Zoo. She was born in Thailand in 1947. She came to Japan for the first time after the war, gifted to Ueno Zoo in 1949. She inherited the name of the elephant ""Hanako (Wanry)"" who was starved to death during the war. Hanako visited the whole country and Tokyo under the Ueno Zoo's  ""Mobile Zoo"" project that began in 1950 and visited Inokashira Natural Culture Park for three consecutive years. On 5 March 1954 she was moved to Inokashira Park Zoo from Ueno Zoo.

In 1956, she stepped on and killed a man who was inebriated and trespassing before the garden opened. In 1960 she stepped on and killed a male keeper.

Her lower left teeth fell out in the 1980s, so she has been fed with a liquid diet consisting of banana and apple.  In 2013, Hanako broke the longevity record of elephants raised in Japan.  On May 26, 2016, she died at the age of 69.

98,26031040,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staying%20Power%20%28album%29,Staying Power (album),"Staying Power is the twentieth and final studio album by American R&B singer Barry White, released on July 27, 1999.  The album was White's first release for five years, and his only recording for the Private Music label, with whom he had signed following a four-album deal with A&M which had culminated in 1994 with the acclaimed The Icon Is Love, his most successful album since the 1970s.

Staying Power features duets with Chaka Khan and Lisa Stansfield.  These are the only White tracks with a shared vocal credit, apart from the 1981 duet album Barry and Glodean. Lead single ""Staying Power"", although not a significant hit, won White two Grammy Awards in 2000 in the categories Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance.  It also contains covers of War's ""Low Rider"", which seems tailor-made for White's voice and a slowed-down version of Sly and The Family Stone's ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)"" (done the same way Sly recorded it on his ""There's A Riot Goin' On' album) with a rap by a rapper solely identified as Mr. Rogers. Staying Power was less successful than The Icon Is Love, peaking at #13 on the R&B chart and #43 on the pop chart.  Similarly, its critical reception was more mixed, the overall opinion tending to the view that while there is little to find fault with, the material and production is less distinguished than had been the case with The Icon Is Love.  (Allmusic reviewer Stephen Erlewine for example describes Staying Power as ""...classy and entertaining, but [it] doesn't add to the legacy"".)

99,36481871,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edderside,Edderside,"Edderside is a hamlet in the civil parish of Holme St. Cuthbert in Cumbria, United Kingdom. It is located approximately one mile as the crow files to the south-east of Mawbray, or two-and-a-half miles by road, and a similar distance east of Salta, and north-east of Allonby. The small hamlet of Jericho is located less than a mile to the north-east. Approximately 23 miles to the north-east is the city of Carlisle. Allonby Bay, an inlet of the Solway Firth, is one-and-a-half miles to the south-west, as is the B5300 coast road which runs between Silloth-on-Solway, six-and-a-half miles to the north, and Maryport, six miles to the south.

Notable landmarks in the area include Edderside Hall and the church at Holme St. Cuthbert. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside were conducted in 1989–1990 by Robert H. Bewley.

Etymology
The name Edderside is derived perhaps from the Old English ædre-sīde, meaning ""beside the water-course"". Another possibility for the first part of the name is *ador, an ancient Brittonic river-name element, meaning ""a channel"", from the name for a stream that flows into the Black Dub. Recorded variant spellings include Eddersyde,  Edarside,  Eddysid, Etherside,  Ederside, and Adderside.

History
The area around Edderside has a very long history. On nearby Salta Moss, a Bronze Age rapier was discovered in the 1980s, and may have been crafted as early as 1100BC, proving the area was inhabited at least by that time. The rapier currently resides in the Tullie House museum in Carlisle. The site of the present hamlet was inhabited by the second century AD, and there are Roman remains in the vicinity.

This section of the west Cumbrian coastline was fortified by the Romans during this period, as a series of milefortlets were constructed to guard the Solway coast beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall. The remains of Milefortlet 17 are located at nearby Dubmill Point.

Following the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, records from Holmcultram Abbey in Abbeytown showed Edderside paid an annual tithe of six large baskets of meal. Also during the 16th century, raids by Scots across the Solway Firth were still relatively common. At Dubmill Point, a man named William Osmotherly was kidnapped for ransom during such a raid. As such, local communities including Edderside participated in the ""seawake"", a night watch along the coast.

In the 19th century, there were six functioning farms in the hamlet, each paying an annual tithe of twelve bushels of barley. In 1828, a man named William Barwise built a large home in the hamlet which is still standing. He and his wife Fanny moved to the area from Shropshire and lived in Edderside Hall until 1845, when they left the area for Liverpool. Between the 1820s and 1870s, one additional cottage was built for farm labourers. By the mid-19th century, Edderside was considered to be a wealthy settlement, at least by the standards of the area, with a single estate in the early 1880s being worth at least £10,000. Adjusted for inflation, such an estate would be worth £1,000,000 in the 2010s.

In 1878, an iron ship was commissioned in Liverpool bearing the name Edderside by the Whitehaven Ship Building Company. She had her maiden voyage from Liverpool that year, arriving in Sydney in June 1879. In 1895 she was converted to a barque rig, and sold to new owners based in Norway in 1903. She sank off the coast of South Africa in 1919, having left the port of Durban bound for Buenos Aires with a cargo of coal, but collided with another vessel in dense fog. All seven hands were lost.

Edderside today

Edderside is a small hamlet with three functioning farms, but lacks any facilities of its own. There is a caravan park and restaurant, Manor House Park, to the south-west on the road leading to the coast. At nearby Mawbray, the Lowther Arms pub closed in May 2018. The village of Allonby has several hotels and restaurants, a leisure centre with a swimming pool, and Twentyman's, a small shop.

On the B5300 coast road, a mile-and-a-half to the south-west of Edderside, a bus service runs approximately once every two hours north to Silloth-on-Solway and south to Maryport. From Maryport railway station, the nearest station to the hamlet, trains along the Cumbrian Coast Line head north to Carlisle and south to Whitehaven, Barrow-in-Furness, and occasionally Lancaster.

Edderside lies within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This AONB was designated to preserve what was determined to be one of the most picturesque stretches of coastline in all of England. Nearby Salta Moss is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

101,44158116,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism%20cover%20test,Prism cover test,"The prism cover test (PCT), is an objective measurement and the gold standard in measuring strabismus, i.e. ocular misalignment, or a deviation of the eye. It is used by ophthalmologists and orthoptists in order to measure the vertical and horizontal deviation and includes both manifest and latent components. Manifest is defined by the eye deviating constantly or intermittently, whereas latent is where the deviation is normally controlled but becomes present when the eyes are dissociated. A PCT reveals the total deviation and cannot distinguish between latent and manifest strabismus as you are using an alternate cover test.

A number of different instruments are required when performing a PCT.
 Horizontal and vertical prism bars (or loose prisms).
 An occluder 
 Near accommodative target. For example, near fixation stick 
 Distance target. For example, most commonly a Snellen chart is utilised, however the LogMAR chart is preferred as it has letters of equal legibility, same numbers of letters on each row and uniform spacing between letters and rows This compared to the Snellen Chart which has ‘poor reproducibility and reliability’ 

In order to perform a PCT, you must first perform a cover test as this gives an estimation of the size of the strabismus, thus an approximate starting point on the prism bar. You can also get an indication of presence and type of strabismus by observing the patients’ eye and observing corneal reflections, also known as Hirschbergs.  It also shows whether the patient has a manifest or latent deviation. If a manifest deviation is present, it reveals which eye has the deviation or if it is alternating between both eyes.

Indicated in 
 Patients with manifest and latent strabismus 
 Patients with concomitant and incomitant deviations.
 Horizontal and vertical deviations 
 Patients with good fixation, visual acuity and cooperation 
 For accurate (within two prism dioptres) numerical recording that will provide a point of reference for future consultations 
 Monitoring the efficacy of various noninvasive treatments and also surgery interventions

Not indicated in 
 Cyclotropias or torsional deviations 
 Patients with eccentric fixation because the movement of the deviating eye stops when the stimulus falls on the eccentric retinal area used for fixation and not on the fovea 
 Patients that do not have simultaneous perception 
 Patients that have difficulty with nystagmus
 Unreliable deviations greater than eighty prism dioptres

Advantages 
 Provides complete dissociation that gives the maximum angle of deviation 
 Provides a comparison of distance and near deviations

Disadvantages 
 Can not be used in all types of deviations as above in ‘Not indicated in’

Method 
The prism cover test must be conducted at near (33 cm), at distance (6m) and if necessary at greater than 6 metres.
Before commencing the test, ensure the patient is sitting upright with their chin and head straight. Patients with a head tilt (abnormal head posture) are ‘not formally controlled by using a bite bar or chin rest’ and are always tested with their head tilt and then without their head tilt 

The results leading on from the cover test will give you an indication of the type of deviation and which way you should hold your prism for the next stage of the test. Either BASE IN for an exodeviation (eye turned out), BASE OUT for an esodeviation (eye turned in), BASE UP for a hypodeviation (eye turned down) or BASE DOWN for a hyperdeviation (eye turned up).

Steps:
1. The patient should be measured in primary position first and then in any other positions of gaze of concern. For near fixation, the patient should hold an accommodative target (fixation stick) at 33 cm, ensuring it is in line with their visual axis. By having the patient read out loud the letters at the top of the fixation stick, it is easy to ensure they are maintaining their accommodation.

2. The examiner then holds the prism bar over the patients deviating eye, starting at a small strength prism, however, if the deviation on the cover test appeared to be large, a larger strength prism may be used to achieve results quicker.

3. With the prism present, an alternate cover test is performed. It is important that an alternate cover test is performed correctly in order to ensure maximum dissociation as we are determining the total deviation size which includes both latent and manifest.

Note: It is important to ensure the patient maintains good fixation, by continuing to look at the near fixation stick.

4. As the alternate cover test is performed, the examiner watches the patients eye for movement. If movement is seen, the prism bar is moved to increase the power. If the ‘deviation exceeds 50 prism dioptres, such that a single prism bar cannot be used’, prisms can either be stacked or split 

5. Prism strength is increased until the eye under the prism produces no movement, meaning the deviation is neutralised.

6. To confirm neutralisation the next prism of increasing strength should produce a movement in the opposite direction indicating overcorrection.

7. Once the results for the near PCT have been recorded, the procedure should be repeated at 6m with the Snellen chart and if needed at greater than 6m by patient fixating out the window.

8. Continue the test until neutralisation has been established.

Recording 
The PCT recordings assist in classification and diagnosis of specific strabismic conditions by comparing the size of the deviation from near to distance and also in other various positions of gaze.

When recording the results obtained on a PCT it must be noted:
 If correction (glasses or contact lenses) was worn at the time of measurement
 The fixation distance where the prism neutralised the deviation. That way we can gain an understanding as to whether it increases or decreases in size in different positions of gaze and therefore make a diagnosis of whether it is a concomitant or incomitant deviation.
 The prism base utilised. For example, Base in (BI), Base out (BO), Base up (BU) or Base down (BD).
 The angle of the deviation with the units in prism dioptres
 Which eye is fixating and which eye is deviating
 Whether the test was performed with or without an abnormal head posture

Examples of recording 
                PCT cc  (D) 12 p.d BI  6 p.d BU (FL) (N) 18 p.d BI  6 p.d BU (FL)

or

                PCT cc  (D) 12 p.d BI  R/L 6 p.d (FR&L)     (N) 18 p.d BI  R/L 6 p.d (FR&L)

Interpretation 
In the first example, it has been noted that when conducting the PCT, this patient wore correction, was fixing left and has a twelve prism dioptre exotropia in the distance. At near they have a larger exotropic deviation measuring 18 prism dioptres. They also have a right hypertropia of six prism dioptres. This means that when the PCT was performed, the deviating eye was neutralised and no movement was seen at these points on the prism bar.

Considerations 
 Ensure prisms are held straight, if they are held off centre the power of the prism will not be accurate. There are two types of prisms, the first type is glass prisms which need to be held in the prentice position and the second type is plastic prisms that need to be positioned in the frontal plane.
 Try to estimate the angle of deviation before placing the prism over the affected eye, this way time can be saved in busy clinics and especially with children who may have a short attention span.
 In larger deviations when stacking prisms (see image for table of stacking prisms) or prism bars it may be easier to place one before each eye to better observe if there is any movement taking place 
 The cover should be altered slowly enough to give the patient time to fixate accurately and avoid fusion by continued use of alternate cover test 
 To control accommodation with a fixation target ensure it is maintained by asking the patient to identify the next letter

103,37601680,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%20Louisiana%20State%20Hospital,East Louisiana State Hospital,"The East Louisiana State Hospital is a state-operated mental hospital located on Louisiana Highway 10, a short distance east of the town of Jackson, Louisiana in East Feliciana Parish.

History

The hospital was created by the Louisiana Legislature in 1847 and commenced operations in 1848. The hospital was originally known as the ""State Insane Asylum."" The location was chosen because Jackson is situated in an upland well-drained location that is relatively free of disease-bearing mosquitos, which plagued asylums in New Orleans. The main building, which was built between 1847 and 1854 is considered to be a particularly fine example of Greek revival architecture.

The United States Census for 1860 lists the names of 98 patients.

Dr. John Welch Jones, a resident of Jackson, was appointed as superintendent in 1874. Jones found the treasury had no funds, the patients had no clothes to wear, and lacked the necessities of life. Jones was forced to dip into his own pocket to provide operating funds for three months. He organized the strongest inmates as farm laborers and had them produce vegetables and field products for consumption in the asylum.

He purchased a brick making machine and had the inmates make bricks. Having produced 3,000,000 bricks of good quality, he was able to persuade the state legislature to appropriate funds for a new building. This was followed by four more buildings.

The capacity of the hospital was increased from 166 to more than 600. The hospital received 130 inmates from New Orleans in one day.

The New Orleans Civil Sheriff transported more than 80 patients to the Insane Asylum in 1895,

The hospital, then known as the East Louisiana Hospital for the Insane, did not participate in the early twentieth century eugenics movement, which called for the sterilization of persons considered to be mental defectives, however such persons were segregated.

Richard Avedon made a series of photographs, depicting the state of patients at the hospital in 1963.

The hospital campus contains a cemetery for patients who died at the asylum.

The hospital today

Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals operates the East Louisiana State Hospital, which provides ""mental health evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation services to adult citizens of Louisiana in a manner that will meet all legal and regulatory standards for patient care, accreditation, and licensing bodies."" The hospital now includes a number of separate clusters of buildings known as ""colonies"". The hospital provides more than 500 psychiatric beds.

The hospital has a forensic unit where people who have committed crimes and been judged insane receive care.

It separately has other units where non-criminals receive care.

Background
Early work included recordings of distorted telephone calls and late night television. He uses a range of vintage recording equipment and analog synthesisers, electronic percussion and drum machines. 
In 2007 the Protect & Survive EP was released on the White Label Music record label. This early work was created using little or no percussion instead using a Doepfer analogue sequencer to create simple, minimal rhythms. Soon after the release of the EP Kontour was approached by Some Bizzare Records. The label owner, Stevo Pearce (ex-manager of Soft Cell), wanted to include The Kennedy Syndrome on a new compilation album he was compiling titled Some Bizzare Double Album. This led to the recording of a new studio album for the record label. In 2008 Kontour released the album Scanners on Some Bizzare Records, Stevo Pearce is credited as executive producer of the album. The album was released after the ""Protect & Survive"" EP and moved on from the minimal sounds of tracks like Shark Cage. The album was recorded using no MIDI instruments or personal computers, instead primitive music sequencers, Roland RE-501 tape effects and a Roland CR-78 Drum Machine were used. The vocals on the album where treated like a sound source and manipulated with audio effects.
Kontour worked with the American group Lucid Sketchmaster collaborating on the album The Seed. Kontour featured on the track ""God Come Tell Me"" contributing lyrics and ""music construction"".
In 2012 Kontour contributed a recording to a project titled A Broadcast to the Trees. The project involved a selection of unreleased music, contributed by various artists, which was broadcast via an FM transmitter into the Galloway Forest. The broadcast was not archived or streamed online. The only people who were able to hear the transmission would have been in a small radius of the forest at the time. After the music was transmitted it was deleted. Other artists who contributed to this project included Gareth Jones, Martyn Ware and Dave Ball.

Scanners recording for Some Bizzare Records (2008)
In 2007 Kontour began recording sessions for Some Bizzare Records. The album was completed at the end half of 2007 being mixed and mastered for its 2008 release date. Mastering took place at The Exchange in London and was performed by Simon Davey who has mastered bands like Laibach, Aphex Twin and Depeche Mode.
Scanners was released on 4 February 2008.  It was largely composed of experimental, electronic songs. Songs structures were improvised incorporating a less than disciplined approach. The release had mixed responses, some listeners found the album too experimental. While others labeled it ""original"".

Passed in 2001, the specific wording in Article 181 states that performing actions to ""turning over or obtaining a dependent person"" is considered human trafficking and deemed illegal. Article 181 is part of the Chapter of Belarusian law that list crimes against persons, freedom, honor and dignity.

Punishments 

If a person is found guilty of a ""general offense"" related to this article could be sentenced from a period of three months prison term and up to three years of probation or up to six years in prison with the option of the state seizing the property of the convicted.

If the persons that are being trafficked are considered minors under the law and/or involve a group of people to be sold as prostitutes or sex slaves, the punishment is increased to a prison term of five to ten years.  People who are sold for their organs also face the five- to ten-year prison terms.  Organized crime circles are also affected by this section, since the law targets both individuals and groups who deal with human trafficking.

If the person being trafficked suffers a physical injury that leads to serious health problems or death, the prison term is extended to eight or fifteen years.

Text of the Law 

Actions intended to sell or purchase or undertake other types of activities regarding turning over or obtaining a dependent person (trafficking of people), shall be subject to the arrest-up to three months; or to restriction of freedom-up to three years; or to imprisonment with the seizure of property or without-up to six years.
The same actions committed:
knowingly against a juvenile;
against two or more persons;
with the goal of sexploitation or other type of exploitation;
with the goal of using the victim's organs or tissue for purposes of transplantation;
by a group of people based on foregoing planning, or by an organized group;

alternate retelling of the first film. It has a significantly larger budget ($20 million) than its predecessor ($7.6 million). Lead actor York detailed the making of the film in a journal which he then published in book form, titled Dispatches from Armageddon.

Plot
Stone Alexander is a six-year-old boy whose mother has died giving birth to his younger brother, David. During a party at his influential father's home, Stone is left alone with David, who is in his crib. As Stone stares into the fireplace, a fiery force engulfs the boy, possessing him. Stone attempts to burn his baby brother, but David is saved by their nanny. Their father, Daniel (David Hedison), sends Stone away to a military academy in Italy for his education, under the guidance of General Francini (Franco Nero).

Not long after arriving at the academy, he is drawn to a church where he meets his demonic Guardian (Udo Kier) (who later becomes Stone's false prophet), and participates in a black mass ceremony. Years pass, and although Stone is periodically abused by some of his classmates, he eventually earns their respect, becoming the top student in his class. After graduating, Stone meets his younger brother David (Chad Michael Murray), who is now a teenager. Soon after graduation, Stone marries his Italian girlfriend, Gabriella, the daughter of General Francini. The General was initially against their marriage, but Stone summons two smoke-like demons to intimidate the General into giving in.

Eventually, Stone becomes President of the European Union He uses his seat of power to dissolve the United Nations and create a world government called the World Union. To consolidate his power, Stone pressures the President of the United States Richard Benson (R. Lee Ermey) to join his global community. Stone summons Benson to meet with him in Rome. Prior to departing for Italy, President Benson orders the U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet to take up position off of the coast of Italy in the event of an emergency.

Accompanying the president on his flight to Italy is David Alexander (Michael Biehn), who is now the Vice President of the United States, and the president's military aide, U.S. Marine Colonel Rick Howard (Gil Colon). During an informal meeting on Air Force One, David and Col. Howard warn the president to keep his distance from Stone, due to a CIA report, which indicates that over 200 people who had opposed Stone in the past had died under questionable circumstances after close contact. Unfortunately, Benson fails to grasp just how ruthless Stone really is; Stone kills him with a supernaturally induced heart attack. David is sworn in as the new President at the hour of President Benson's death.

Much to Stone's disappointment, his brother also refuses to join his New World Order. Secretary of State Breckenridge (Jim Metzler) however, wants the United States to join the global community aligned with Stone.  After failing to convince David to fall in line with the World Union, he publicizes a doctored video of David murdering his father. In reality, it was Stone who killed him.

Breckenridge orders the FBI to arrest the president. After a heated exchange of gunfire between the Secret Service detail and the FBI agents, the president escapes by helicopter to Norfolk Naval Base, where the U.S. Navy brass provides him with transport to the Sixth Fleet on an amphibious assault ship. After arriving, David orders a special forces raid on Stone's castle headquarters in Rome; however, he discovers that Stone is already in Israel. David finds Gabriella (Diane Venora) in the dungeon, confined there by the Guardian after she witnessed some of Stone's demonic powers. She dies in David's arms after professing her love. Following the raid, Colonel Howard receives word that Breckenridge is sending U.S. troops to Israel to join Stone's military coalition, which are on the plains of Megiddo planning a strike on Jerusalem.

Following the raid in Rome, David and Colonel Howard move quietly to join U.S. forces already in Israel. Unknown to Stone, the Mexicans, Chinese, and Americans are really there to destroy Stone and his army. David attempts to kill Stone himself but is soon captured.

Later, Chinese tanks open fire upon his European troops from one side while U.S. and Mexican forces attack from the other. Shortly afterwards, Stone's troops are hit by air strikes as well. Taken completely by surprise, and with his forces being quickly overrun, Stone instructs all his soldiers to fight to the death.  After overrunning Stone's armored and artillery positions, the Mexican tanks charge headlong, targeting the enemy headquarters.

Stone and his officers are swallowed in a huge fireball as tank shells rain in.  David barely manages to break free and jump away before the headquarters explodes behind him.  David is stunned as Stone walks out of the ashes unharmed. He then morphs into a massive creature with some ram's horns and huge leather wings. David realizes in horror that the creature is the incarnation of the devil himself. After fatally wounding David, Stone/Satan summons up his dark brethren as reinforcements, and revives his dead army.  In a full display of his supernatural powers, he even darkens the sun, plunging the whole battlefield into darkness.

The reinforcements soon outnumber and overrun the Mexican, Chinese, and American forces. In triumph, Stone/Satan, celebrates as he cries out loudly that he is Lord.  At this boast, a bright white light lances down into the ruins of the headquarters, and begins dropping meteors of light upon the battlefield. All of Stone's soldiers are killed, while all of the allied survivors remain untouched, and are freed from their bonds. Stone's former Guardian is dismayed at Stone/Satan's defeat, and tries to run from the battlefield. A globe of light chases him and quickly impales him with swords of pure light, causing him to be vaporized. Stone/Satan himself is driven to his knees, and forced to admit that Jesus Christ is the one true Lord. The light then pulverizes the ground beneath him, dropping Stone/Satan (who is trying in vain to hang onto a ledge and is calling out for David to come and save him right before he loses his grip while shouting Nazarene) into a deep pit of molten lava, the Lake of fire. There he finds out that he is chained, and screams in anguish, defeated. As David lies on the ground looking up into the sky smiling, the light becomes brighter, and then fades away, revealing a scene of an Earthly paradise. A scripture is revealed on screen that God has established his home with man, and that He shall reign forever, and ever.

Ever since seeing Sydney Pollack’s great ironic World War two movie Castle Keep (1969), I have wanted to stage modern war at an ancient castle. Megiddo (2001) provided the perfect opportunity at Castle Ordeski in Brac-chiano, where indenta-tions of cannonballs from a sixteenth-century siege are still visible on the walls. We however, didn’t leave a scratch as twelve Apache helicopters strafed the battlements, while US Army Rangers rappelled down and fought their way in. this is because our choppers are digital, intercut with stuntmen rappelling from off-screen scaffolding. this kind of sequence would have been prohibitive, even with my $18 million budget, until the computer graphic era. In the battle scenes we can digitally multiply tents and tanks on the ground and add Harriers and helicopter gunships to the skies.
Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 has been aired frequently by the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), both over the internet and on television, since its initial release in 2002.

The film was produced by Code Productions in conjunction with TBN's Gener8Xion Entertainment, Infinity Omnimedia, and TBN Films.

Reception
Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 10% based on reviews from 20 critics.

Accolades
Cinematographer Bert Dunk was nominated for Best Cinematography in Theatrical Feature at the Canadian Society of Cinematographers Awards.

113,5833004,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%20Walker%20Phillips,Mary Walker Phillips,"Mary Walker Phillips (November 23, 1923 – November 3, 2007) was an American textile artist, author and teacher. She revolutionized the craft of hand knitting by exploring knitting as an independent art form.  In the catalog to her 1984 Fresno Arts Center exhibition, Jack Lenor Larsen described Phillips as the ""transition between the old-fashioned, pattern-book knitting and the extraordinary things going on in England and America today.""  Her hand-knit tapestries and other creative pieces are exhibited in museums in the U.S. and Europe.

Biography 
Phillips was born in Fresno, California, on November 23, 1923, and began knitting in childhood as a traditional knitter.  She attended the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan from 1946-1947, when she received her BFA, studying contemporary weaving and textiles. She moved to San Francisco and worked in the studio of Dorothy Liebes as a weaver before setting up her own studio. Her talent was quickly recognized by the wife of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who commissioned her to create interior textiles for Taliesin West, the Wrights' home in Scottsdale, Arizona. Later, she traveled to Europe before returning to Fresno where she worked as a freelancer and teacher.

In 1960, she returned to the Cranbrook Academy of Art to continue her studies in experimental textiles. She earned her MFA in 1963. She then moved to Greenwich Village, New York City.

Work 
Inspired by a friend, textile designer Jack Lenor Larson, she added knitting to her artistic practice. The Fresno Art Museum showed 100 of her works in 1964. The works included woven upholstery, tie-dyed blankets, wall hangings, rugs, knitted sculptures and ceramics. She is well known for her architecturally inspired knitted wall hangings that were very abstract and is regarded as a pioneer in the use of experimental materials. These knitted art pieces incorporated unusual natural and synthetic materials such as linen, silk, paper, tape, leather, hair, asbestos fibers, seeds, fiberglass and metals. Unlike past knitting forms, she strayed away from the usual patterns and instead created works that resembled tapestries and lace. As a fellow of the American Craft Council, she is noted as being the first to acknowledge knitting as a form of artistic expression.

Phillips created woven textile works for architectural spaces, but soon her work transitioned from weaving into knitted works and macramé. This shift in her artistic practice was an important part of the transition of the 20th century fiber arts movement, that implicated the movement from utility to art.

Besides being an important fiber artist, she was also an important teacher and taught at the New School for Social Research.

Phillips is regarded as one of the most important fiber artists of the 20th century, as well as an important personality in the fiber arts movement and the advancement of the American studio craft.

Books 
Her books about hand knitting for the mass market and her workshops helped revolutionize the mass production industry, shifting it from woven fabrics to knits. Previously, knitting had been limited to the creation of practical items, such as sweaters. Her works and influence helped create the hand crafted, 'DIY' revolution.

Jack Lenor Larsen (a textile designer) wrote in the forward to Phillips' book, Step by Step Knitting, “[S]he is the great knitter of our time. She has taken knitting out of the socks-and-sweater doldrums to prove that knit fabric can be a blanket, a pillow, a piece of art ... she demonstrates that knitting is a creative medium of self-expression.”

Her works are in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design (Smithsonian) New York. She has written five books on knitting and macramé including: Step-by-Step Knitting (1967); Step-By-Step Macramé (1970) (which sold 700,000 copies by 1972); Creative Knitting, An Art Form (1971); Knitting (1977); and Knitting Counterpanes, Traditional Coverlet Patterns for Contemporary Knitters (1989).

In 1984, she was awarded a fellowship grant from the National Endowment for the Arts for her last book, Knitting Counterpanes: Traditional Coverlet Patterns for Contemporary Knitters.

116,920765,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat%20%28system%20call%29,Stat (system call),"is a Unix system call that returns file attributes about an inode.  The semantics of  vary between operating systems. As an example, Unix command  uses this system call to retrieve information on files that includes:
 atime: time of last access ()
 mtime: time of last modification ()
 ctime: time of last status change ()

stat appeared in Version 1 Unix. It is among the few original Unix system calls to change, with Version 4's addition of group permissions and larger file size.

stat() functions
The C POSIX library header , found on POSIX and other Unix-like operating systems, declares the stat() functions, as well as related functions called fstat() and lstat(). The functions take a struct stat buffer argument, which is used to return the file attributes. On success, the functions return zero, and on error, −1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.

The stat() and lstat() functions take a filename argument. If the file is a symbolic link, stat() returns attributes of the eventual target of the link, while lstat() returns attributes of the link itself. The fstat() function takes a file descriptor argument instead, and returns attributes of the file that it identifies.

The family of functions was extended to implement large file support. Functions named stat64(), lstat64() and fstat64() return attributes in a struct stat64 structure, which represents file sizes with a 64-bit type, allowing the functions to work on files 2 GiB and larger (up to 8 EiB). When the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS macro is defined to 64, these 64-bit functions are available under the original names.

The functions are defined as:

int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int lstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int fstat(int filedesc, struct stat *buf);

stat structure
This structure is defined in  header file as follows, although implementations are free to define additional fields:

struct stat {
	mode_t			st_mode;
	ino_t			st_ino;
	dev_t			st_dev;
	dev_t			st_rdev;
	nlink_t			st_nlink;
	uid_t			st_uid;
	gid_t			st_gid;
	off_t			st_size;
	struct timespec	st_atim;
	struct timespec	st_mtim;
	struct timespec st_ctim;
	blksize_t		st_blksize;
	blkcnt_t		st_blocks;
};

POSIX.1 does not require st_rdev, st_blocks and st_blksize members; these fields are defined as part of XSI option in the Single Unix Specification.

In older versions of POSIX.1 standard, the time-related fields were defined as st_atime, st_mtime and st_ctime, and were of type time_t.  Since the 2008 version of the standard, these fields were renamed to st_atim, st_mtim and st_ctim, respectively, of type struct timespec, since this structure provides a higher resolution time unit. For the sake of compatibility, implementations can define the old names in terms of the tv_sec member of struct timespec. For example, st_atime can be defined as st_atim.tv_sec.

The struct stat structure includes at least the following members:

 st_dev identifier of device containing file
 st_ino inode number
 st_mode protection mode; see also Unix permissions
 st_nlink reference count of hard links
 st_uid user identifier of owner
 st_gid group identifier of owner
 st_rdev device identifier (if special file)
 st_size total file size, in bytes
 st_atime time of last access
 st_mtime time of last modification
 st_ctime time of last status change
 st_blksize preferred block size for file system I/O, which can depend upon both the system and the type of file system
 st_blocks number of blocks allocated in multiples of DEV_BSIZE (usually 512 bytes).

The st_mode field is a bit field. It combines the file access modes and also indicates any special file type. There are many macros to work with the different mode flags and file types.

Criticism of atime 

Reading a file changes its  eventually requiring a disk write, which has been criticized as it is inconsistent with a read only file system. File system cache may significantly reduce this activity to one disk write per cache flush.

Linux kernel developer Ingo Molnár publicly criticized the concept and performance impact of atime in 2007, and in 2009, the  mount option had become the default, which addresses this criticism. The behavior behind the  mount option offers sufficient performance for most purposes and should not break any significant applications, as it has been extensively discussed. Initially,  only updated atime if atime < mtime or atime < ctime; that was subsequently modified to update atimes that were 24 hours old or older, so that  and Debian's popularity counter (popcon) would behave properly.

Current versions of the Linux kernel support four mount options, which can be specified in fstab:
  (formerly , and formerly the default;  as of 2.6.30) always update atime, which conforms to the behavior defined by POSIX
  (""relative atime"", introduced in 2.6.20 and the default as of 2.6.30) only update atime under certain circumstances: if the previous atime is older than the mtime or ctime, or the previous atime is over 24 hours in the past
  never update atime of directories, but do update atime of other files
  never update atime of any file or directory; implies ; highest performance, but least compatible
  update atime according to specific circumstances laid out below

Current versions of Linux, macOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, and NetBSD support a  mount option in /etc/fstab, which causes the atime field never to be updated. Turning off atime updating breaks POSIX compliance, and some applications, such as mbox-driven ""new mail"" notifications, and some file usage watching utilities, notably tmpwatch.

The  option on OpenBSD behaves more like Linux .

Version 4.0 of the Linux kernel mainline, which was released on April 12, 2015, introduced the new mount option . It allows POSIX-style atime updates to be performed in-memory and flushed to disk together with some non-time-related I/O operations on the same file; atime updates are also flushed to disk when some of the sync system calls are executed, or before the file's in-memory inode is evicted from the filesystem cache.  Additionally, it is possible to configure for how long atime modifications can remain unflushed.  That way, lazytime retains POSIX compatibility while offering performance improvements.

ctime 
It is tempting to believe that  originally meant creation time; however, while early Unix did have modification and creation times, the latter was changed to be access time before there was any C structure in which to call anything . The file systems retained just the access time () and modification time () through 6th edition Unix. The  timestamp was added in the file system restructuring that occurred with 7th edition Unix, and has always referred to inode change time. It is updated any time file metadata stored in the inode changes, such as file permissions, file ownership, and creation and deletion of hard links. In some implementations,  is affected by renaming a file: Both original Unix, which implemented a renaming by making a link (updating ) and then unlinking the old name (updating  again) and modern Linux tend to do this.

Unlike  and ,  cannot be set to an arbitrary value with , as used by the  utility, for example. Instead, when  is used, or for any other change to the inode other than an update to  caused by
accessing the file, the  value is set to the current time.

Time granularity 
  provides times accurate to one second.
 Some filesystems provide finer granularity. Solaris 2.1 introduced a microsecond resolution with UFS in 1992 and a nanosecond resolution with ZFS.
 In Linux kernels 2.5.48 and above, the stat structure supports nanosecond resolution for the three file timestamp fields. These are exposed as additional fields in the stat structure.
 The resolution of create time on FAT filesystem is 10 milliseconds, while resolution of its write time is two seconds, and access time has a resolution of one day thus it acts as the access date.

The painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote:126. THE MUSIC-PARTY. deG. 34. On the left in a large hall, the left-hand portion of which is represented, sit three persons at a table covered with an Ispahan carpet, upon which are some oranges. One gentleman plays the cello, another the flute, while a lady sings. The flute-player sits on the extreme left behind the table, wearing a slouch hat. 
The cello-player sits to the right of the table, in full view of the spectator ; he has long curls, and wears knee-breeches and a pink doublet with slashed sleeves over a white shirt with broad cuffs. He raises a glass with his left hand and holds his bow with his right. He looks at the lady sitting at his right ; she has her music-book in her lap, and wears a greenish bodice and a yellow silk skirt. Between the two men is a boy, and behind him a couple. From the right comes a little dog. At the back of the hall a flight of stone steps goes up through a door. A second door on the right shows a well-lighted room, in which a young couple stand. Above these doors a copy of Raphael's School of Athens is let into the wall.

According to Dr. W. Bode, the picture dates from about 1662 to 1665. Its canvas is 32 inches by 27 inches. Described by Ch. Blanc, Le Tresor de la Curiosite, ii. 262. 
Owners of the painting include Pierre de Grand Pre, Paris, February 16, 1809 (bought for 2620 -francs, Paillet), James, London, 1892 (Thieme), and it is in the collection of the A. Thieme at Leipzig, No. 45 in the 1900 catalogue

The large hall, the left-hand portion of the painting, is a gallery of the main hall of the (then) Amsterdam City Hall, today the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. The painting at the back is a fantasized version of the School of Athens by Raphael, but in reality another painting was installed. The gallery is possibly the one in the southeast corner near the registry office for weddings, as there are three couples represented. Possibly the doorway on the right is meant to be the registry office itself.

De Hooch made at least two more paintings with scenes of the interior of the Amsterdam City Hall:

She was the creator of a series of folk art sculptures known collectively as Mollie Jenson’s Art Exhibit (also known as Mollie Jenson’s Zoo & Museum). Her work is an example of outsider art and vernacular architecture.

Mollie Nelson was born in 1890, the daughter of a Norwegian farmer. She inherited her father's farm near River Falls, and lived there until 1959. She married Obert Jenson in 1911, and was the mother of six children. Her early artwork consisted of traditional craft items, including hooked rugs, quilts, paintings, horn furniture, and wood carvings.

Jenson completed her first outdoor sculpture, the ten-foot tall Dutch Windmill, in 1940. The Windmill was constructed of concrete embellished with tile mosaics, topped with electric lights and a blackface lawn jockey. Jenson’s 1941 Fireplace began as an outdoor hearth made of concrete, limestone, and ceramic pieces. Through continual additions, she expanded the structure into a cavern-like, elaborately decorated covered patio. Her last large-scale work was the Horseshoe, a diorama inspired by the Patriotism Shrine at nearby Dickeyville Grotto. The Horseshoe consisted of a semi-circular stone wall, decorated with curving concrete spires and deer antlers.

From 1938 to 1959, Jenson also operated a roadside zoo featuring 150 animals, including monkeys, peacocks, a lion, and a retired circus bear.

Following Jenson’s death, family members concerned with the safety of the structures demolished all but the Dutch Windmill.

123,972038,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De%20Havilland%20Firestreak,De Havilland Firestreak,"The de Havilland Firestreak is a British first-generation, passive infrared homing (heat seeking) air-to-air missile. It was developed by de Havilland Propellers (later Hawker Siddeley) in the early 1950s, entering service in 1957. It was the first such weapon to enter active service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm, equipping the English Electric Lightning, de Havilland Sea Vixen and Gloster Javelin. It was a rear-aspect, fire and forget pursuit weapon, with a field of attack of 20 degrees either side of the target.

Developed under the rainbow code ""Blue Jay"", Firestreak was the third heat-seeking missile to enter service, after the US AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder, both of which entered service the previous year. In comparison to those designs, the Firestreak was larger and almost twice as heavy, carrying a much larger warhead. It had otherwise similar performance in terms of speed and range. It was also a very complex system, with an unusual internal design, requiring the launch aircraft to provide both cooling for its tube-based electronics and heating to prevent various moving parts from freezing prior to launch.

An improved version, ""Blue Vesta"", was developed as part of the Operational Requirement F.155 project but ended when that project was canceled in 1957. Development restarted as a somewhat simpler version for the Lightning which was given the name ""Red Top"". This featured transistorized electronics and greatly simplified internal design. Keeping its code name, it entered service on Lightning and Sea Vixen as the Hawker Siddeley Red Top. Red Top could not be carried on early versions of the Lightning, and so Firestreak remained in service until 1988, when the last RAF Lightnings retired.

Development

Red Hawk
Firestreak was the result of a series of projects begun with the OR.1056 Red Hawk missile, which called for an all-aspect seeker that could attack a target from any launch position. When this proved too ambitious for the state of the art, another specification lacking the all-aspect requirement was released as Blue Sky, which briefly entered service as Fireflash the year before Firestreak.

Blue Jay
In 1951 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), in charge of missile development, felt that infrared seeking had progressed to the point of reconsidering the Red Hawk requirement. This too turned out to be too demanding for the seekers of the era, although a more limited tail-aspect design was clearly possible in the short term. This led to another lower-performance specification that was released in 1951 as OR.1117, and given the Ministry of Supply rainbow codename Blue Jay.

Blue Jay developed as a fairly conventional-looking missile with cropped delta wings mounted just aft of the midpoint and small rectangular control surfaces in tandem towards the rear. Internally, things were considerably more complex. The tube-based electronics took up most of the forward quarter of the fuselage, leaving little room for a warhead. This led to the warhead being moved to the rear of the fuselage where it was wrapped around the rocket nozzle. That left no room for the actuators for the rear-mounted control fins, which were instead operated by nose-mounted actuators via long pushrods. The actuators were powered by compressed air from bottles at the extreme rear, fed forward through long pipes. The air bottles also powered a turbo-alternator for electrical power after launch. In the case of a miss, the missile self-destructed when the alternator slowed down after the air ran out.

The Magpie rocket motor took up only a small portion of the missile fuselage, placed between the actuators and the warhead, roughly centred under the mid-mounted wings. It consisted of  of cordite that burned for 1.9 seconds, exiting the rear of the missile via a long tailpipe running through the rear section of the missile.

The lead telluride (PbTe) IR seeker was mounted under an eight-faceted conical arsenic trisulphide ""pencil"" nose and was cooled to  to improve the signal to noise ratio. The unusual faceted nose was chosen when a more conventional hemispherical nose proved prone to ice accretion. The seeker was cooled by running filtered air through an ammonia-cooled heat exchanger.

There were two rows of triangular windows in bands around the forward fuselage, behind which sat the optical proximity fuzes for the warhead. The prodigious  warhead had a  lethal radius and was triggered either by the proximity fuzes or four contact fuses set on the front of the wings. The outer casing of the warhead was designed to fragment into  pieces fired forward in a 50 degree cone.

The electronics, made from vacuum tubes, generated significant heat. For this reason, the Firestreak missile undergoing a ground test was cooled by Arcton, and in-flight by ammonia pumped through the missile from bottles in the rear of the launching ""shoe"". The bottles contained enough ammonia for 15 minutes, so the missile could only be started up during the approach. An air bottle in the fuselage-mounted weapon pack kept the ammonia bottles pressurized before launch. Hot air from the engine compressor stages connected to the rear of the launch pack and was routed to the missiles. During flight, this kept various moving components warm, warm enough that they would not freeze up during the 13 second flight time.

Service

The first airborne launch of Blue Jay took place in 1955 from a de Havilland Venom, the target drone - a Fairey Firefly - being destroyed. Blue Jay Mk.1 entered service in 1957 with the RAF, where it was named Firestreak. Firestreak was deployed by the Royal Navy and the RAF in August 1958; it was the first effective British air-to-air missile.

For launch, the missile seeker was slaved to the launch aircraft's radar (Ferranti AIRPASS in the Lightning and GEC AI.18 in the Sea Vixen) until lock was achieved and the weapon was launched, leaving the interceptor free to acquire another target. A downside was that the missile was highly toxic (due to either the Magpie rocket motor or the ammonia coolant) and RAF armourers had to wear some form of CRBN protection to safely mount the missile onto an aircraft. ""Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, ... Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.""

Improvements
Two minor Blue Jay variants were studied but not adopted. The Blue Jay Mk.2 included the more powerful Magpie II motor and a PbTe seeker which offered better detection capabilities. Blue Jay Mk.3 had an increased wingspan and reduced performance motor. The derated motor was intended to limit acceleration when launched from supersonic rocket-powered interceptors such as the Saunders-Roe SR.177 and Avro 720, where the additional speed imparted by the Magpie II would have given it a maximum speed so high it would suffer from adverse aerodynamic heating.

Looking for an improved weapon for the Operational Requirement F.155 interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk.4, which was later given its own rainbow code, Blue Vesta. This adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk.2, further improved by cooling it to improve its sensitivity in what became known as the ""Violet Banner"" seeker. The motor was further upgraded to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as ""mach tips"". Work on Mk.4 was curtailed after 1956 as the RAE decided that the closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so rapid that the missile would have no chance to be launched while still within the range of its seeker.

In August 1956, the Fleet Air Arm took over development of the Blue Jay line with Blue Jay Mk.5, replacing the IR seeker with a semi-active radar homing (SARH) system intended to be used with the De Havilland Sea Vixen's AI.18 radar with a special continual wave illuminator mode. This was otherwise identical to Mk.4, differing only by replacing its seeker section with a longer ogive nose cone holding the radar receiver antenna. Problems fitting the illuminator antenna to the Sea Vixen ended work on this project. In November 1957 it was briefly restarted under the name Blue Dolphin as other radar-guided developments ended, but this was never deployed.

Red Top

After the fallout of the 1957 Defence White Paper led to the cancellation of the F.155 and many other interceptor projects, the English Electric Lightning was allowed to continue largely because development was almost complete. This left it with no modern weapon, so Blue Vesta was reactivated in a slightly modified form. In November 1957, paperwork with the Blue Vesta name on it was considered disclosed and the project was assigned the new name ""Red Top"".

In contrast to the Mk.4 there were several important changes. The adoption of transistorized circuits in place of the former thermionic valves eliminated the need for cooling the electronics, as well as making the guidance section significantly smaller. This allowed the warhead to be moved from its former position near the tail to the midsection, which also allowed it to grow in size and weight, replacing the former blast-fragmentation type with an expanding-rod system that was significantly deadlier. The rear section of the missile was now left empty, allowing the fin actuators to be moved there, removing the complex routing. This still left more room that was used up by replacing the Magpie III with the new Linnet, which offered significantly higher performance and boosted the typical top speed of the missile from Mach 2.4 to 3.2 whilst almost doubling effective range to .

Given the elimination of the ammonia cooling, which was also used by the Violet Banner seeker of the Mk.4, the decision was made to use a simplified seeker that did not require cooling to the same level. This led to a new indium antimonide (InSb) design that was cooled with purified air at  filtered to 3 μm. This reduced its sensitivity compared to Violet Banner, lacking its true all-aspect ability, but further simplified the design and eliminated ground handling concerns.

Never given its own name by the RAF, the new design entered service in 1964 as Red Top. It was faster and had a longer range than Firestreak, and ""was capable of all aspect homing against super-sonic targets."" Despite Red Top being intended to replace Firestreak, Firestreak remained in limited service until the final retirement of the Lightning in 1988; carrying Red Top required more vertical tail to stabilize the effects of the missile's larger wings, so Firestreak remained in use on older models of the Lightning.

They were rebuilt from earlier LBSCR E1 class 0-6-0T locomotives originally built 1874–1883. The rebuilt locomotives were intended to be used in the West of England.

Construction
In 1927 there was a surplus of the Stroudley ‘E’ tanks in service on the Central Section of the Southern Railway, many of which were in good condition as they had been fitted with larger boilers by D.E. Marsh after 1911. At the same time there was a need for additional tank locomotives in the Western Section for use in shunting, station piloting and particularly for services on the North Cornwall line to Padstow.

Ten locomotives had their frames extended, bunkers and water tanks enlarged at Brighton works over the next two years. A pony truck of the same design as a ’N’ class locomotive was also added to create a radial trailing axle, making them 0-6-2T. The rebuilt locomotives were dispatched to the Western section during 1928 and 1929 and found to be successful. Some complaints from passengers about rough riding on the meandering North Cornwall line were addressed by having the locomotives on this line re-balanced during 1936 while other locomotives that weren't balanced were restricted to local and shunting and banking duties.

The new class performed well for nearly twenty years but withdrawal commenced in 1955 and they were finally all replaced by Ivatt's prairie tanks by 1959.

133,37203811,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS%20Peel%20Castle,SS Peel Castle,"The passenger steamer SS Peel Castle was operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company from her purchase in 1912 until she was sold for breaking in 1939.

Construction and dimensions
Peel Castle was built as Duke of York at Dumbarton by William Denny and Brothers, who also supplied her engines and boilers. She had a registered tonnage of ; length 310 feet; beam 37 feet; draught 16 feet and a design speed of 17 knots.

Peel Castle had accommodation for 1,162 passengers, and a crew of 42.

Pre-war service
As Duke of York she entered service in 1894 on the joint Fleetwood - Belfast service of the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway and the London & North Western Railway. In 1911, she was sold to the ""Turkish Patriotic Committee"". In 1912 the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company purchased her and renamed her Peel Castle; the company also purchased Duke of Lancaster, renamed The Ramsey.

War service
She was requisitioned by the Admiralty at the outbreak of war in 1914.

She was fitted out as an Armed Boarding Vessel (ABV) by Cammell Laird in late November 1914. She was to have 100 officers and crew and was fitted out as an auxiliary, capable of carrying boarding parties and prize crews, and was put under the command of Lieutenant-Commander P. E. Haynes RNR

Peel Castle sailed under the White Ensign in January 1915, her engine room manned mostly by Steam Packet Company personnel, and became part of the Downs Boarding Flotilla, a section of the Dover Patrol. She remained with the Patrol for three years and one month.

She would spend ten days at sea and four days in port at Dover. She was mainly tasked with regulating the large amount of maritime traffic between the Kent coast and the Goodwin Sands and to act as one of the guard ships that would stop and examine all neutral shipping proceeding to Continental ports. For the duration of the war the Dover Strait was closed by anti-submarine nets and minefields. No ship could pass except through the Patrol, and at one stage British warships were intercepting, searching and marshalling up to 115 vessels a day.

In this strenuous work, Peel Castle played a busy and successful part. She was first fired upon by a retreating merchantman, and then at least once by British shore batteries. She endured many air raids and sent boarding parties onto many ships. Her crew captured a number of enemy personnel who were trying to get back to Europe hidden in neutral ships, including Franz von Rintelen, an infamous agent of Admiral Tirpitz.

In 1916 she was badly damaged by fire and had to be refitted at Chatham. Later she transferred to the Orkney Islands. After having been fitted with depth charge throwers and paravanes and with her boat deck extended as a landing for kite balloons, she patrolled north of Shetland.

Peel Castle was next moved to the Humber-Tyne Patrol, an area where shipping was very concentrated and where losses had been heavy. With her observer aloft in the balloon she would cruise up and down the convoys, looking for enemy submarines.

The war over, Peel Castle was refitted once more, this time as a troop carrier, work she continued until May 1919, after which she returned to Liverpool and resumed her peacetime Steam Packet Company duties.

Post-war service

Upon returning to the Steam Packet fleet, Peel Castle was mainly used for subsidiary winter services. She undertook the direct Friday sailing from Liverpool to Ramsey, and also excursion trips and cargo duties.

On the morning of Saturday 7 June 1924, Peel Castle went aground in Douglas Bay. She had left Liverpool operating the midnight sailing, and had approximately 550 passengers embarked. As she approached Douglas, Peel Castle encountered a bank of fog which forced her to slow her speed. Steaming at minimal speed, Peel Castle continued inbound to Douglas, sounding her whistle continuously, but ran aground on a bank of sand in the middle of Douglas foreshore. The impact was reported to be so slight that passengers were unaware of the situation until members of the ship's company informed them of the development.

As the tide receded and the fog began to lift, a large crowd gathered on the shore. Passengers remained on board Peel Castle until she refloated. Shortly after 13:00hrs the vessel was refloated, aided by the Fenella, and then proceeded to Douglas Harbour under her own power.

No apparent damage could be seen so Peel Castle left Douglas the following day, bound for the Graving Dock at Cammell Laird's in order to be inspected by representatives of Lloyd's of London. No damage was found on the subsequent inspection, and Peel Castle returned to service.

Disposal
Peel Castle was retired after a service life of 45 years. She was broken up at Dalmuir on the Clyde in February 1939.

Delta¹ Tauri (δ¹ Tauri, abbreviated Delta¹ Tau, δ¹ Tau) is a double star in the zodiac constellation of Taurus. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 20.96 mas as seen from Earth, it is located roughly 156 light-years distant from the Sun. The system is faintly visible to the naked eye with a combined apparent visual magnitude of +3.772. It is considered a member of the Hyades cluster.

The two constituents are designated δ¹ Tauri A and B. A is itself a binary star with components designated δ¹ Tauri Aa (officially named Secunda Hyadum , the traditional name for the entire system) and Ab.

Nomenclature 

δ¹ Tauri (Latinised to Delta¹ Tauri) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two constituents as Delta¹ Tauri A and B, and those of A's components - Delta¹ Tauri Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The system bore the traditional name Hyadum II, which is Latin for ""Second of the Hyades"". In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Secunda Hyadum for the component Delta¹ Tauri Aa on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

In Chinese,  (), meaning Net, refers to an asterism consisting of δ¹ Tauri, Epsilon Tauri, Delta³ Tauri, Gamma Tauri, Alpha Tauri (Aldebaran), 71 Tauri and Lambda Tauri. Consequently, the Chinese name for Delta¹ Tauri itself is  (), ""the Third Star of Net"".

Properties 

Delta¹ Tauri A is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 529.8 days and an eccentricity of 0.42. The visible member, component Aa, is an evolved G- or K-type giant star with a stellar classification of . The 'CN0.5' suffix indicates a mild overabundance of cyanogen in the outer atmosphere. It is chromospherically active and shows a radial velocity variation of  with a period of . The primary, component Aa, has 2.8 times the mass of the Sun, while the secondary, component Ab, has 1.3 times the Sun's mass.

Delta¹ Tauri B is a magnitude 13.21 visual companion separated by 111.8 arcseconds from A. It is most likely not physically related to the main star.

Between the late 18th century and 1947, it used to be a suburb of the town of Gorizia (now in Italy). When the city was partitioned in 1947, most of the city center remained in Italy, while its eastern suburbs were annexed to Yugoslavia. Part of Pristava (Rafut) remained in Italy, and while part of it became part of Slovenia. In some cases, the border was drawn literally between individual houses. Until Slovenia's entry into the Schengen zone in 2007, a local border pass functioned in Pristava.

The Kostanjevica Monastery, in which Charles X of France is buried, is located on a hill above the settlement.

Inspection work began in the early 1990s and was a collaboration between the Organization Department and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's anti-graft body. The decision to formally establish the leading group was announced in November 2009 by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The group gained special prominence since 2013 under the leadership of Wang Qishan as a result of the wide-reaching anti-corruption campaign following the 18th Party Congress. The Leading Group and its General Office is tasked with dispatching ""inspection teams"" (xunshizu, 巡视组) to the provinces, central government organs such as ministries, and state-owned enterprises.

Under Wang Qishan, inspection teams have been sent out in several 'rounds', with each round numbering about a dozen inspection teams who 'embed' themselves as part of a regional or central organization for weeks to conduct inspection work on party disciplinary enforcement. Several prominent cases, such as that of Hubei Vice-Governor Guo Youming, Inner Mongolia politician Wang Suyi, Guangzhou Party Secretary Wan Qingliang, and a whole host of officials from Shanxi province, were initiated by the central inspection teams.

Playing career

Club

Blanchfield played his club hurling with the famous James Stephens club in Kilkenny and enjoyed much success.  He won his first senior county title in 1935.  It was the club's first ever victory in a county final.  Blanchfield added a second county medal to his collection in 1937.

Inter-county

Blanchfield first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Kilkenny in 1935.  That year he collected his first Leinster title following a victory over Laois. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Blanchfield's take on Limerick for the second time in three years. Once again the match was a close one, however, Kilkenny clung on and won by a single point – 2-5 to 2-4. It was Blanchfield's first All-Ireland medal.  

In 1936 Blanchfield added a second Leinster medal to his collection before lining out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Once again, the two outstanding teams of the decade, Kilkenny and Limerick, were paired together in the championship decider. Limerick were coming into their prime at this stage and gained revenge for the defeats of 1933 and 1935 by trouncing ‘the Cats’ on a score line of 5-6 to 1-5.  

Kilkenny bounced back in 1937 with Blanchfield collecting a third Leinster winners' title.  The All-Ireland final pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary in the unusual venue of FitzGerald Stadium in Killarney. ‘The Cats’ were definitely on a downward spiral by this stage as they were walloped by 3-11 to 0-3.  

In 1939 ‘the Cats’ reclaimed their provincial crown with a victory over reigning All-Ireland champions Dublin.  It was Blanchfield's fourth provincial medal of the decade.  The subsequent All-Ireland final against Cork has gone down in history as the famous ‘thunder and lightning’ final when a huge downpour interrupted play. In the end victory went to Kilkenny by a single point.  It was not the last time that ‘the Cats’ would defeat ‘the Rebels’ by a single point in a final.  It was Blanchfield's second All-Ireland medal.  

In 1940 Blanchfield added a fifth Leinster medal to his collection after another defeat of Dublin.  The All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny and Limerick, the two dominant team of the last decade, take to the field for one final game.  Kilkenny had peaked in the final the year before while Limerick were now reaching their prime.  A 3-7 to 1-7 defeat for Kilkenny resulted in Blanchfield ending up on the losing side for the third time.  

An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the county hampered Kilkenny’s championship hopes for the next few seasons.  In spite of this the team bounced back in 1943 with Blanchfield adding a sixth Leinster medal to his already impressive collection. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final provided what was regarded as the time as the biggest shock in the history of the championship. Antrim had defeated Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final in, what was described as, a fluke.  Antrim proved that their victory was far from lucky as they defeated Blanchfield's side in the subsequent semi-final.  

Two years later in 1945 Blanchfield won his seventh and final Leinster medal before lining out in his final All-Ireland final.  Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion.  Almost 70,000 people packed into Croke Park to witness a classic encounter, with 5,000 more fans being locked out of the stadium.  Tipp took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back with three second-half goals.  In spite of this Tipp held on to win the game by 5-6 to 3-6.  Blanchfield retired from inter-county hurling after this defeat.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Furness, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of four other local parishes. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.

History

The church was built in 1874 to a design by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. Holy Trinity was built on the site of an earlier church. For 67 years the curate of that church had been Robert Walker, who was made famous by the poet William Wordsworth. Wordsworth called him ""Wonderful Walker"", and made reference to him in his Duddon Sonnets and in the poem The Excursion. It was paid for mainly by the industrialist H. W. Schneider.

Architecture

Exterior
Holy Trinity is constructed in coursed slate rubble and has a slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel in one range, with an organ loft and vestry to the north, and a south porch. At the west end is a gabled bellcote. All the windows are lancets. There are wide buttresses externally between the nave and the chancel. A stone is attached to the porch incorporating a sundial; this had formerly been the shearing stool of Walker.

Interior
Inside the church is a stoup with a trefoil arcade. Painted on the wall of the chancel are the Ten Commandments. Also in the church is a brass. This had formerly been on a gravestone; it is to the memory of Walker, who died in 1802, and his wife, Anne, who had died two years previously. The stained glass, dating from 1897, is by Kempe. The two-manual organ was built in 1902 by Young.

Gordon film The Food of the Gods, based on the 1904 H.G. Wells novel of the same name. It is a sequel in name only, as its plot bears no relation to the 1976 film.

The main themes of the film are animal testing and size change. In the film, a growth serum is tested on lab rats, turning them into giants. While the animals rampage, the use of the same serum on cancer cells causes massive tumors.

Plot 
Dr. Neil Hamilton (Paul Coufos) receives a call from his mentor Dr. Kate Travis (Jackie Burroughs) about a young boy named Bobby, whose deficient growth has been treated with Travis' experimental serum. Bobby has swiftly and unexpectedly grown larger than a full-grown adult and become violent. To find an antidote, Neil takes a sample of the serum back to his lab at a university science complex. There, animal-rights activists led by Mark Hales (Réal Andrews) and Neil's girlfriend Alex Reed (Lisa Schrage) are protesting the work of Prof. Edmund Delhurst (Colin Fox), who claims to study cancer but in fact subjects animals to experimentation seeking a cure for baldness.

Neil and his assistant Joshua (Frank Pellegrino) inject the serum into some lab rats. That night, the activists (minus Alex) break into the complex to trash Delhurst's lab and accidentally release the now-giant rats, which kill Mark and escape into the campus' utility tunnels. Police Lieutenant Weizel (Michael Copeman) does not believe the surviving activists' statements despite Neil's corroboration about the serum, and Dean White (David B. Nichols) hires a pair of exterminators to handle what he believes are normal-sized rats.

The giant rats kill several people, including one of the exterminators and the surviving activists, Al and Angie, escape. But the giant rats apparently kill whoever tried to hunt the animals down themselves. Delhurst's assistant, a janitor named Zeke, is attacked. But, the surviving exterminator, despite taking several rat bites to his arms and face, appears and burns this rat. Later, a night watchman tries to escape some rats, though he is killed off screen.  Alex discovers the body of a workman (a Mexican forced from his car and chased by rats) while two other men killed by the rats, whose bodies are still in the car, are discovered by the police. Although Lieutenant Weizel is convinced of the threat, Dean White remains skeptical and refuses to shut the campus down because of the upcoming grand opening of the university's new sports complex. When Joshua falls victim to the rats, Neil attacks the Dean and is fired.

Delhurst steals the serum sample and tests it, first on Neil's pet rat Louise, then on a sample of cancer cells. He accidentally contaminates himself with treated cells and dies within minutes as his entire body develops massive tumors. Neil returns to the lab to retrieve the antidote he has created, testing it by destroying Delhurst's transformed corpse. Meanwhile, the rats attack the swimming competition being held in the new sports complex, killing several people including Dean White.

Neil uses the enlarged but still-docile Louise, who is in heat, to lure the giant (male) rats into the university courtyard where Weizel and his men gun them all down. Neil phones Dr. Travis to inform her of the antidote, but it is too late; Bobby, now psychotic and larger than ever, kills Travis while she is on the phone and escapes.

It was produced by the Only Ones themselves, with the assistance of Robert Ash and was mixed at Basing St., Escape and CBS.

The album was re-released in Europe in 2009 on Sony Music Entertainment, featuring rare bonus content. The reissue was a CD which comprises 13-tracks. It includes the original album digitally remastered from the original 1/2"" mix tapes; alongside three bonus tracks.

Critical reception

Trouser Press called it ""the best of the three original albums"" in which ""Perrett's languid vocals and songs provide the character and focus, while the band's skills carry it off handsomely"". The album is still widely admired by British critics. In 1994, The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music named The Only Ones one of the 50 best punk albums of all-time. The compilers claimed that the Only Ones were ""the closest thing the UK had to Johnny Thunders' Heartbreakers, a laconic, shamble of a band who were, at moments, touched by a creative greatness that made you get out of the glare"".

Since the end of the 1990s, the album has also appeared on several all-time greatest albums lists. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

151,1885523,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teorema,Teorema,"Teorema, also known as Theorem (UK), is a 1968 Italian allegorical film written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini and starring Terence Stamp, Laura Betti, Silvana Mangano, Massimo Girotti and Anne Wiazemsky. Pasolini's sixth film, it was the first time he worked primarily with professional actors. In this film, an upper-class Milanese family is introduced to, and then abandoned by, a divine force. Themes include the timelessness of divinity and the spiritual corruption of the bourgeoisie.

Plot
A mysterious figure known only as ""The Visitor"" appears in the lives of a typical bourgeois Italian family. His arrival is heralded at the gates of the family's Milanese estate by an arm-flapping postman. The enigmatic stranger soon engages in sexual affairs with all members of the household: the devoutly religious maid, the sensitive son, the sexually repressed mother, the timid daughter and, finally, the tormented father. The stranger gives unstintingly of himself, asking nothing in return. He stops the passionate maid from committing suicide with a gas hose and tenderly consoles her; he befriends and sleeps with the frightened son, soothing his doubts and anxiety and endowing him with confidence; he becomes emotionally intimate with the overprotected daughter, removing her childish innocence about men; he seduces the bored and dissatisfied mother, giving her sexual joy and fulfillment; he cares for and comforts the despondent and suffering father, who has fallen ill.

Then one day the herald returns and announces that the stranger will soon leave the household, just as suddenly and mysteriously as he came. In the subsequent void of the stranger's absence, each family member is forced to confront what was previously concealed by the trappings of bourgeois life. The maid returns to the rural village where she was born and is seen to perform miracles; ultimately, she immolates herself by having her body buried in dirt while shedding ecstatic tears of regeneration. The mother seeks sexual encounters with young men; the son leaves the family home to become an artist; the daughter sinks into a catatonic state; and the father strips himself of all material effects, handing his factory over to its workers, removing his clothes at a railway station and wandering naked into the wilderness, where he finally screams in primal rage and despair.

Reception
On its release, the religious right and the Vatican criticized the sexual content in the film. Others considered the film ""ambiguous"" and ""visionary"". The film won a special award at the Venice Film Festival from the International Catholic Film Office, only for the award to be withdrawn later when the Vatican protested.

Scholars view the film differently due to the openness or ambiguity of the film. The author of A Certain Realism: Making Use of Pasolini’s Film Theory and Practice, Maurizio Viano, says that in order to understand the film there must be ""adequate translation"". Most scholars writing about the film do not discuss Pasolini's cinematographic techniques but Pasolini's philosophical arguments. Viano argues that Pasolini intended to be theoretical in this film because he wanted to be recognized as ""a film theorist"".

Structure and title etymology
Teorema means theorem in Italian. Its Greek root is theorema (θεώρημα), meaning simultaneously ""spectacle"", ""intuition"", and ""theorem"". Viano suggests that the film should be considered as ""spectatorship"" because each family member gazes at the guest and his loins , although this seems unlikely: the Greek word denotes the object of spectatorship, rather than the actual act of spectatorship, which would be theoresis (θεώρησις).

As a term, theorem is also often considered as mathematical or formulaic. In this sense, the film also contains a programmatic structure. It begins with documentary-like images and then moves on to the opening credit with a dark volcanic desert, a home party scene, cuts of the factory in sepia tone, introduction of each family member in silence and sepia tone, and, then, the guest sitting in the back yard in colour. The middle section is divided into three: ""seductions"", ""confessions"" and ""transformations"".

Not only is the film's structure formulaic but so is the psychological development of each character. They all go through ""seductions"", ""confessions"" and ""transformations"". The way each character changes their state of mind is the same. They all fall into a sexual desire for the guest. They all have sex with him. When the guest leaves, they all, except the maid, confess to him how they feel about themselves. In the final section of the film, after he leaves, they lose the identities they previously possessed. The maid goes back to her village and performs miracles while subsisting on nettles, but asks to be buried alive. The daughter falls into a catatonic state. The son maniacally paints his desire for the guest. The mother picks up young men who resemble the guest and has sex with them. The father strips naked in the middle of the train station.

Scholarly interpretations
A common interpretation by cinema scholars is that the film is a commentary on the bourgeois society and emergence of consumerism through the very beginning of the film. The reporter asks a worker at Paolo's factory if he thinks there will be no bourgeois in the future. In The Cinema of Economic Miracles: Visuality and Modernization in the Italian Art Film, Angelo Restivo assumes that Pasolini suggests that even documentary images, which depict facts, fail to show the truth. News can tell the audience only the surface of the events they broadcast. Merely watching the interview of the workers does not tell why factory owner Paolo, gave away the factory. That might be one of the reasons the scene is set in the beginning of the film.

In his biographical work on Pasolini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Enzo Siciliano assumes that Pasolini expresses his struggle of being homosexual in the film. On the other hand, Viano believes that Pasolini's emphasis is not on homosexuality but rather on sexuality in general, because the guest has sex with each member of the household. Sexuality is considered as passion in Viano's interpretation.

Italian critic Morandini, author of a dictionary of cinema, claimed that ""the theorem is demonstrated: the incapacity of modern -bourgeois- man to perceive, listen to, absorb and live the sacred. Only Emilia the servant, who comes from a peasant family, discovers it and, after the 'miracle' of levitation, will return to the ground with a holy smell. It's another film by Pasolini dedicated to the conjunction between Marx and Freud (and, here, Jung and Marcuse too).""

Other versions
Pasolini later expanded this film into a novel with the same name. Giorgio Battistelli composed an opera based on the film. In 2009, Dutch theatre company 'Toneelgroep Amsterdam' created and performed a play version of this movie.

The sketch comedy program Mr. Show aired a segment (series three, episode six) in which a suburban family is slowly revealed, over time, to have all individually had sexual affairs with David Cross, possibly in reference to the film.

Home media
On October 4, 2005, Koch-Lorber Films released the DVD of Teorema in the United States.

On February 18, 2020, The Criterion Collection released a Blu-ray and DVD of Teorema in North America.

159,231339,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20Jersey%20Route%2087,New Jersey Route 87,"Route 87 is a state highway located in Atlantic County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs , heading north from Atlantic City at an intersection with U.S. Route 30 (Absecon Boulevard) to Brigantine, where it terminates at the end of the Brigantine Bridge (designated the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge) over the Absecon Inlet, continuing as County Route 638 (Brigantine Boulevard). In Atlantic City, the route runs through the Marina District, which contains a few casinos, along Huron Avenue and Brigantine Boulevard. Here, Route 87 intersects with Route 187 (Brigantine Boulevard) and the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, the latter providing a limited-access route between Route 87 and the Atlantic City Expressway. Route 87 is the only road to and from Brigantine.

What is now Route 87 was initially proposed as Route S4A in 1927, a spur from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton, Ocean County, south through Brigantine to Atlantic City. The portion of this route south of Little Beach was to be built by Atlantic County; however, the state took over plans of building the road in 1938. Despite this, Route S4A was never completed between Brigantine and Little Beach, and the portion of the road that existed in Ocean County was removed from the state highway system by 1941. In 1945, Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), was proposed to run from Atlantic City to Brigantine along Brigantine Boulevard. Route 87 was created on its current alignment in 1953 as an unsigned route, replacing Route S4A and the proposed Route S56. Previously, Route 87 split into two alignments in Atlantic City along Huron Avenue and Brigantine Boulevard; the Brigantine Boulevard alignment eventually became Route 187.

Route description
Route 87 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City, heading to the northeast on Huron Avenue, an undivided road with two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector and comes to a ramp that provides access from southbound Route 87 to the southbound connector. From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two northbound lanes and five southbound lanes. It passes by the Borgata casino, with a ramp from the casino to the northbound direction. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes under a ramp from the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector to the Borgata before heading under northbound direction of the connector. Here, a ramp from the connector provides access to Route 87. A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of Route 187 and turns north to follow Brigantine Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.

The route passes to the west of the Golden Nugget casino and comes to a ramp that provides access from northbound Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and Harrah's Atlantic City casinos before passing under the northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah's. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and Brigantine to the southeast. After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on Brigantine Island and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and County Route 638 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Brigantine.

History

In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was proposed as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach to be built by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County, known as Great Bay Boulevard, was removed from the state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), was proposed to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.

160,5360511,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissary%20Apostolic,Commissary Apostolic,"A Commissary Apostolic (Latin Commissarius Apostolicus) 
is Commissary (i.e. one who has received power from a legitimate superior authority to pass judgment in a certain cause or to take information concerning it) who has been appointed by the pope, hence commissary Apostolic.

History
The custom of appointing such commissaries by the Holy See is a very ancient one. A noteworthy instance is the commission issued to Cyril of Alexandria by Pope Celestine I, in the early part of the fifth century, by which that holy patriarch was empowered to judge Nestorius in the pope's name. English history furnishes, among other instances, that of the commission which constituted Cardinal Wolsey and Cardinal Campeggio papal representatives for the judicial hearing of the divorce case of King Henry VIII.
 
Sometimes Apostolic commissions are constituted permanently by the Holy See. Such are the various Roman congregations presided over by the cardinals.

The full extent of the authority of commissaries apostolic must be learnt from the diploma of their appointment. The usual powers which they possess, however, are defined in the common law of the Church. Commissaries can be empowered not only for judicial but also for executive purposes. When a papal commission mentions explicitly certain persons and certain things as subject to the authority of a commissary, and then adds in general that ""other persons and other things"" (quidam alii et res aliœ) are also included, it is understood that the latter phrase refers only to persons and things of equal or lower importance than those that are expressly named, and under no circumstances can the commissary's power extend to what is higher or more dignified (Cap. xv, de rescript.). If a bishop be appointed commissary Apostolic in matters that already belong to his ordinary (mainly diocesan) jurisdiction, he does not thereby receive a delegated jurisdiction superadded to that which he already possessed; such an Apostolic commission is said to 'excite', not to alter, his ordinary jurisdiction.

As a Commissary Apostolic is a delegate of the Holy See, an appeal may be made to the Pope against his judgments or administrative acts.
 
When several commissaries have been appointed for the same case, they are to act together as one; but if, owing to death or any other cause, one or other of the commissaries should be hindered from acting, the remaining members have full power to execute their commission. In case the commissaries be two in number and they disagree in the judgment to be given, the matter must be decided by the Holy See.
 
A commissary Apostolic has the power to subdelegate another person for the cause committed to him, unless it has been expressly stated in his diploma that, owing to the importance of the matter at issue, he is to exercise jurisdiction personally.
 
By the plenitude of his power, the Pope can constitute a layman commissary Apostolic for ecclesiastical affairs, but according to the common canon law only prelates or clerics of the higher orders should receive such a commission (Lib. Sext., c. II, de rescr., 1, 3). The Council of Trent (Sess. XXV, c. xvi, de Ref.) prescribes that each bishop should transmit to the Holy See the names of four persons capable of receiving such delegation for his diocese. It has consequently become customary for the Pope to choose commissaries Apostolic from the locality where they are to investigate or pass judgment or execute a mandate.

162,4770511,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pforzheimer%20Zeitung,Pforzheimer Zeitung,"Pforzheimer Zeitung is an independent local subscription newspaper with seat in Pforzheim, which is mainly distributed and read in the city of Pforzheim and the surrounding Enz district. Its language of publication is German and it appears daily, from Monday to Saturday. It features in-depth coverage of news on Pforzheim and the surrounding region, and reports on major national and international events. News topics are 
politics, economy, social issues, and sports. The newspaper has the largest circulation in the region with more than 100,000 copies per day. It has an editorial office in Mühlacker and publishes special local versions for the Mühlacker and Northern Black Forest regions.

The Pforzheimer Zeitung was founded in October 1949 by Jakob Esslinger, who had been operating in Pforzheim as a printer and newspaper publisher since 1928. His earlier newspaper was the daily ""Pforzheimer Rundschau"", a newspaper with a long tradition, which he took over in 1928 and published until March 1, 1943, when it was shut down by the Nazi regime citing ""lack of paper"" as the reason. But this reason was only a pretense, given the independence of the paper in times when the Nazi regime was aiming at total control of the media. The PZ was founded in economically difficult times after the end of World War II and in a town that to a large extent had been destroyed by an area bombardment.

The bombing raid had destroyed all printing presses of Esslinger's company. Pforzheimer Zeitung is registered under the company name ""J. Esslinger GmbH & Co. KG"" and is led by the publisher Albert Esslinger-Kiefer (2006).

The Pforzheimer Zeitung operates its own printing shop in the center of Pforzheim and nowadays is one of the most modern and productive independent newspapers in Germany. It utilizes modern techniques such as electronic text and image processing, digital photography, computer-to-plate technology, high-quality four-color printing, and large rotary printing presses which can print up to 35,000 copies per hour. PZ has established its own internet homepage where it offers a news summary free of charge.

PZ employs about 150 workers, of which 37 employees belong to the editorial staff. PZ earns roughly 70% of its revenue from advertising and the remaining 30% from subscriptions. (All numbers for 2006.)

163,2841846,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmcote,Wilmcote,"Wilmcote is a village, and since 2004 a separate civil parish, in the English county of Warwickshire, about  north of Stratford-upon-Avon. Prior to 2004, it was part of the same parish as Aston Cantlow, and the 2001 population for the whole area was 1,670, reducing to 1,229 at the 2011 Census.

It has a church, a primary school, a village hall, a village club, one small hotel, a shop and a pub. Visitors are attracted to Mary Arden's Farm, the home of Shakespeare's mother.

History
Wilmcote, listed as Wilmecote in the Domesday Book, is part of the lands of Osbern fitzRichard, whose father was Richard Scrob, builder of Richard's Castle. The entry reads: ""In Pathlow Hundred. Also from Osbern, Urso hold 3 hides in Wilmcote. Land for 4 ploughs. In lordship 2; 2 slaves; 2 villagers and 2 smallholders with 2 ploughs. Meadow, 24 acres. The value was 30s; now 60s;. Leofwin Doda held it freely before 1066.""

By 1205, according to Dugdale, it was held by Brito Camerarius, Chamberlain of Normandy and in that year was seized by King John, together with the other English lands of Normans for adhering to the King of France, Phillip II. In 1228 William de Wilmecote was claiming the advowson of the chapel here against the Archdeacon of Gloucester. In 1316 Wilmcote is called a hamlet of Aston Cantlow, and Laurence Hastings, who succeeded as Earl of Pembroke in 1325, is said to have given the manor of GREAT WILMCOTE to John son of John de Wyncote. During the Black Death (1348–9) Sir John, Eleanor and Joan, and three of the daughters died; and the last of the daughters, Elizabeth, whose wardship had come to the Crown as guardian of the young Earl of Pembroke, died in 1350.

No more is known of the manor until 1561, when an estate described as the manor of Great Wilmcote, including Mary Arden's house and land in Shelfield, was granted by Thomas Fynderne of Nuneaton to Adam Palmer of Aston Cantlow and George Gibbs of Wilmcote. Palmer and Gibbs held jointly until 1575, when a partition was made. The descent of Palmer's portion is not known, but Gibbs's, which included Mary Arden's house, remained in the family until another George Gibbs sold it to Matthew Walford of Claverdon in 1704. Walford's son and heir, also Matthew, married Elizabeth Jones and died in 1729, leaving his estates to be held jointly by his five daughters. Whatever manorial rights may have attached to this property had by now disappeared. At the time of the Inclosure in 1742–3 the manor of Wilmcote was included in that of Aston Cantlow, and Elizabeth Walford, widow, appears in the Award only as the proprietor of 5-yard-lands in the common field.

Economy

Wilmcote contains areas of good limestone, and a significant quarrying industry grew up in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly after the opening of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal in 1816 which was routed through Wilmcote because of its quarries. Today the area has many small disused quarries, mostly filled in, and just-visible paths of tramways linking them to the canal. A larger quarry, which has not been filled in, is now a nature reserve. There are remains of lime kilns, built to turn the limestone into cement.

Wilmcote stone splits well into sheets and was used for paving as well as for building. It was used for paving the floors in the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament when these were rebuilt in the nineteenth century.

The last of the quarries closed in the early twentieth century, but they have left a great legacy for the village. There are several rows of former quarry workers cottages, built in Wilmcote stone, and a pub called the Masons' Arms. The quarries were among the reasons why the canal and railway were routed through Wilmcote. The first Wilmcote railway station opened in 1860, on a site alongside the canal wharves; it was replaced by the present station when the line was doubled in 1908.

Governance
Wilmcote is part of the Aston Cantlow ward of Stratford on Avon District Council, and is represented by Councillor Sir William Lawrence Baronet, Conservative. Nationally it is part of Stratford on Avon constituency, whose member of parliament following the 2010 election is Nadhim Zahawi of the Conservative Party. It was included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament.

Geography

Religious sites
There was a chapel at Wilmcote, first mentioned in 1228 when the advowson was in dispute between William de Wilmcote, and the Archdeacon of Gloucester. In the 14th century the advowson was held with the manor of Little Wilmcote, until in 1481 Henry de Lisle gave it to the Gild of the Holy Cross at Stratford. The chaplains were instituted and inducted by the vicars of Stratford.

The Oxford Movement was a Catholic revival movement in the Church of England in the early nineteenth century, centred in Oxford and Wilmcote was the site they chose to build a church, a school and a retreat house. The early nineteenth-century village had no church, it was then a part of the adjoining parish of Aston Cantlow but with a growing working class population due to the growth of the Wilmcote quarries the village was much in need of a church and a school. The modern church of St. Andrew, built in 1841, is a monument to the influence of the Oxford Movement in the parish. It was built by the Rev. Francis Fortescue-Knottesford and his son, who became the first curate, to meet the semi-industrial conditions created by the opening of the cement works in the 1830s. It is a small Anglo-Catholic church, dark, spiritual, and on Sundays filled with the smell of incense. It was designed by the renowned architect William Butterfield, a leader in the Gothic revival.

Education
Situated in Church Road is Wilmcote Church of England (Voluntary Aided) Primary School, which educates 80 children from the age of 4 to 11.

Transport links
Wilmcote railway station is situated on the Stratford-upon-Avon branch line (one of the Snow Hill Lines) and is served by West Midlands Trains with services to Stratford-upon-Avon and Birmingham Snow Hill whilst Chiltern Railways serve Leamington Spa and London Marylebone. The village is a popular stop on the Stratford-upon-Avon to Birmingham Canal, and is on a National Cycleway.

Notable people
Mary Arden was born in Wilmcote around 1540. A farmer's daughter, she married John Shakespeare, moved to Stratford-upon-Avon, and gave birth to William Shakespeare, who is recognised as the greatest English playwright ever. Mary Arden's House, now owned by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, is open to the public and houses a museum of countryside life. William Shakespeare's life and times have been extensively researched and documented and much is therefore known about Wilmcote from the time of Mary Arden onwards.

Cultural references
It is the consensus among scholars that the Induction of The Taming of The Shrew is set in rural Warwickshire. One character mentioned, however, allows for a greater localization – to the village of Wilmcote. Sly, the drunken tinker, beseeches the Lord: ""Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not"" [Ind.2.18–19]. The minutes of the Stratford Corporation, 11 November 1584 (approximately a decade before the play), mention ""the tythes of Wyncote"", the very spelling of the village that appears in the Folio text of The Shrew.

After several large fires in the 17th century, only the south wing (Neues Schloss) remains from the once three-winged palace. It is connected through the fortified bridge Stadtbrille, to the Zeughaus (armory) across the Vils river.

It was built from 1417 by Louis III, Elector Palatine, and replaced the Alte Veste, a Gothic building in the town center, as the electoral court. The original building on the north was added with a south wing, a moat and a gatehouse, by Elector Frederick I turning it into a fortress. Its present appearance with a high voluted gable was set in 1603 by Johannes Schoch, who redesigned the Zeughaus with an added tower on the south. On 1738 horse stables were built as a western wing.

Having served the Electors of the Palatinate from its construction to the abolition of the Electorate, the castle was home, since the 19th century, first to the Royal Bavarian District office and Revenue office, later the District Office of the  Bavarian State Amberg District and from 1972 of the District of Amberg-Sulzbach.

168,379358,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la%20III%20of%20Hungary,Béla III of Hungary,"Béla III (, , ;  114823 April 1196) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1172 and 1196. He was the second son of King Géza II and Géza's wife, Euphrosyne of Kiev. Around 1161, Géza granted Béla a duchy, which included Croatia, central Dalmatia and possibly Sirmium. In accordance with a peace treaty between his elder brother, Stephen III, who succeeded their father in 1162, and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, Béla moved to Constantinople in 1163. He was renamed to Alexios, and the emperor granted him the newly created senior court title of despotes. He was betrothed to the Emperor's daughter, Maria. Béla's patrimony caused armed conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary between 1164 and 1167, because Stephen III attempted to hinder the Byzantines from taking control of Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. Béla-Alexios, who was designated as Emperor Manuel's heir in 1165, took part in three Byzantine campaigns against Hungary. His betrothal to the emperor's daughter was dissolved after her brother, Alexios, was born in 1169. The emperor deprived Béla of his high title, granting him the inferior rank of kaisar.

Stephen III died on 4 March 1172, and Béla decided to return to Hungary. Before his departure, he pledged that he would never make war against the Byzantine Empire. Although the Hungarian prelates and lords unanimously proclaimed Béla king, Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom opposed his coronation because of Béla's alleged simony. Finally, the Archbishop of Kalocsa crowned him king on 18 January 1173, with Pope Alexander III's approval. Béla fought with his younger brother, Géza, whom he held in captivity for more than a decade. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts in the Byzantine Empire after Emperor Manuel's death, Béla reoccupied Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium between 1180 and 1181. He occupied the Principality of Halych in 1188, but it was lost within two years.

Béla promoted the use of written records during his reign. Hungarian chronicles from the 14th century even state that he was responsible for the establishment of the Royal Chancery. The royal palace built in Esztergom during his reign was the first example of Gothic architecture in Central Europe. He was the wealthiest European monarch of his time, according to a list of his revenues, but the reliability of the list is questioned.

Early life

Childhood ( 1148–1163) 

Béla was the second son of Géza II of Hungary and Géza's wife, Euphrosyne of Kiev. The date of his birth was not recorded. Studies of his bones show that Béla died in 1196 at around 49 years old, so he must have been born around 1148.

The contemporaneous John Kinnamos's reference to ""the territory which his father, while still alive, had apportioned"" to Béla shows that Géza II granted a distinct territory as an appanage to his younger son. Béla's patrimony certainly included the central parts of Dalmatia, (which included Šibenik, Split, and Trogir, which had accepted the suzerainty of the Kings of Hungary for decades), because Kinnamos mentioned the province ""as Béla's heritage"". Historians Ferenc Makk and Gyula Moravcsik agree that Béla also received Croatia from his father. Whether Syrmium was also part of Béla's patrimony, or if he only acquired it after his father's death is subject to scholarly debates. According to historian Warren Treadgold, Béla's patrimony also included Bosnia. The exact date of Géza II's grant cannot be determined, but according to Makk, Béla seems to have received his duchy around 1161.

Géza II, who died on 31 May 1162, was succeeded by his first-born son, Stephen III. Stephen III seems to have confirmed Béla's possession of the duchy, because Kinnamos referred to the land which was ""long before granted"" to Béla by Géza and Stephen. Shortly after his ascension to the throne, Stephen III was expelled by his uncles, Ladislaus II and Stephen IV. The Byzantine Emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, supported the uncles' takeover, but Stephen III returned to Hungary and regained his crown by force in the middle of 1163. Béla probably remained neutral during his brother's conflict with their uncles, because there is no report of Béla's activities in 1162 and 1163.

In 1163, Emperor Manuel signed a peace treaty with Stephen III, in which he renounced his support of Stephen's opponents. In exchange, Stephen III agreed to send Béla to Constantinople, and to allow the Byzantines to take possession of Béla's duchy. The Emperor also promised that he would betroth his daughter, Maria, to Béla.

Despotes Alexios (1163–1169) 

Emperor Manuel dispatched sebastos George Palaiologos to escort Béla to the Byzantine Empire. Béla arrived in Constantinople around the end of 1163. He was renamed to Alexios, and received the title of despotes (""lord""), which only emperors had used before that time. Béla's betrothal to the emperor's daughter was also officially announced.

Stephen III invaded Syrmium in the summer of 1164. Emperor Manuel led his armies against Stephen, stating that he arrived ""not to wage war on the Hungarians but to recover his land for Béla"", according to Kinnamos. Béla-Alexiosalong with his uncle, Stephen IV, and their distant relative, Stephanos Kalamanosaccompanied the emperor during the campaign. Before long, a new peace treaty was signed, once again forcing Stephen III to renounce Béla's duchy. A Byzantine army occupied Syrmium, which was organized into a Byzantine theme, or district.

Stephen III launched a new invasion against Syrmium in the spring of 1165. Emperor Manuel directed the counter-attack, and Béla accompanied him again. After the imperial army recaptured Zimony (now Zemun in Serbia), Béla persuaded the emperor to prohibit the execution of the Hungarian soldiers who were captured in the fortress. A Byzantine army also occupied Dalmatia. A new peace treaty between Stephen III and Emperor Manuel followed, which confirmed the emperor's suzerainty in Béla's former duchy. Dalmatia and Bosnia were soon converted into Byzantine themes.

Emperor Manuel ceremoniously made his daughter and Béla-Alexios his heirs, and forced the Byzantine notables to swear an oath of fidelity to them in the autumn of 1165. Only the emperor's cousin, Andronikos Komnenos, dared to condemn this act, asking, ""What madness is this of the emperor to deem every Roman male unworthy of his daughter's nuptial bed, to choose before all others this foreigner and interloper to be an emperor of the Romans and to sit above all as master?"", according to the nearly contemporaneous Niketas Choniates. Béla-Alexios participated in the 1166 Council of Blachernae, together with Emperor Manuel and the Ecumenical Patriarch Luke Chrysoberges. In the spring of 1166, Béla-Alexios accompanied protostrator Alexios Axouch, who led a Byzantine army against Hungary in retaliation for a new Hungarian invasion of Syrmium. On 11 April 1166, although Béla-Alexios and his bride were related to each other, Emperor Manuel confirmed a decision of the Ecumenical Patriarch, which stated that marriages between kin to the seventh degree were void. Manuel even proposed a marriage between his daughter (Béla-Alexios's fiancée) and the new King of Sicily, William II, in the autumn of 1166.

A new war broke out between Hungary and the Byzantine Empire in 1167, because Béla-Alexios ""claimed the kingdom"" of his brother, according to the contemporaneous Rahewin. Henry of Mügeln also wrote that many Hungarians joined and served the army of Béla-Alexios, stating that ""the Kingdom of Hungary belonged to him [Béla-Alexios] by right"". On 8 July 1167, the Byzantine army annihilated the Hungarian troops in the Battle of Sirmium. A peace treaty was signed, which put an end to the period of wars between Hungary and the Byzantine Empire, and confirmed the dominion of the Byzantine Empire over central Dalmatia, Bosnia and Syrmium.

Kaisar Alexios (1169–1172) 
Emperor Manuel's wife, Maria of Antioch, gave birth to a son named Alexios on 14 September 1169. The emperor dissolved his daughter's betrothal to Béla-Alexios. The emperor also removed Béla-Alexios's title of despotes, but granted him the inferior rank of kaisar. In the spring of 1170, Béla-Alexios married the emperor's sister-in-law, Agnes of Antioch. The couple went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In Jerusalem, they donated 10,000 bezants to the Knights Hospitaller in compensation for their hospitality. In the charter of grant, Béla-Alexios styled himself ""Lord A., Duke of Hungary, Dalmatia and Croatia"", ignoring the title that the emperor had recently bestowed upon him.

Reign

Coronation (1172–1173) 

Béla's brother, Stephen III, died on 4 March 1172. Arnold of Lübeck, who was staying in Esztergom, recorded a rumor suggesting that Stephen had been poisoned by Béla's supporters, but no other source verifies this hearsay. Stephen III's widow, Agnes, left Hungary, although she was pregnant when her husband died. A Hungarian delegation visited Emperor Manuel and Béla in Sardica (now Sophia in Bulgaria). They demanded that ""Béla be dispatched to them as king"", because ""the principle of justice looked toward him"" after his brother's death, according to Kinnamos. Kinnamos also said that Emperor Manuel made Béla king after Béla ""promised an oath to observe for the whole course of his life whatever would be beneficial"" to the emperor and the Byzantines. A letter written by the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in 1196 says that on the same occasion, Béla pledged that he would never support the Serbians if they fought against the Byzantine Empire.

Béla and his wife arrived in Székesfehérvár in late April or early May. Béla was unanimously elected king by the ""dignitaries of the Hungarian kingdom"", according to a letter written by Pope Alexander III in 1179. However, Béla's coronation was delayed, because Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom, refused to perform it. The archbishop accused the king of simony, because Béla had given a precious cloak to his delegate. According to a scholarly theory, Archbishop Lucas also feared that the influence of ""schismatics"" would increase under Béla's rule. Nevertheless, the majority of the barons and prelates remained loyal to Béla. Béla sought the assistance of the Holy See against the Archbishop Lucas. Upon Béla's request, Pope Alexander III authorized the Archbishop of Kalocsa to anoint Béla king and ""place the crown on his head"". Béla's coronation took place on 18 January 1173. He issued a charter confirming the right of the archbishops of Esztergom to crown the Hungarian monarchs. The unification of the so-called ""Greek"" and ""Latin"" crowns into the Holy Crown of Hungary seems to have occurred during his reign.

Conflicts (1173–1178) 

Archbishop Lucas fell out of favor with Béla, and was ignored by him in the first years of his reign. Instead of Lucas, the Archbishop of Kalocsa baptized Béla's first-born son, Emeric, in 1174. However, administering sacraments to members of the royal family had always been the archbishops of Esztergom's job. According to a Bohemian chronicle (Continuatio Gerlaci abbatis Milovicensis), Béla imprisoned his younger brother, Géza, but Géza escaped from prison and fled to Austria in 1174 or 1175. Stephen III's judge royal, Lawrence, accompanied Géza. When Henry Jasomirgott, Duke of Austria, refused to extradite Géza, Béla launched plundering raids into Austria, together with Soběslav II, Duke of Bohemia. Meanwhile, Béla sent reinforcements to Emperor Manuel to help him fight against the Seljuks, but their united forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Myriokephalon on 17 September 1176.

Géza tried to persuade Soběslav II of Bohemia to help him meet Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, but Soběslav seized Géza and handed him over to Béla in 1177. Béla once again imprisoned his brother, and he also put their mother, Euphrosyne, in confinement. In retaliation for Soběslav's role in Géza's capture, Emperor Frederick dethroned Soběslav and appointed another member of the Přemyslid dynasty, Frederick, to the position of duke. The Holy Roman Emperor ordered the new Duke of Austria, Leopold V, to storm Bohemia. Béla soon intervened, threatening Leopold V with an invasion, which forced Leopold to leave Bohemia.

Expansion and reforms (1178–1194) 

Béla's long-time favorite, Andrew, Archbishop of Kalocsa, insulted him around 1178. Béla soon deprived him and his supporter, the Provost of Székesfehérvár Chapter, of their offices and seized the Archbishop's revenues. Pope Alexander III punished Béla with ecclesiastic sanctions, but Béla reconciled with Archbishop Lucas of Esztergom, who absolved him and excommunicated Andrew of Kalocsa. The conflict ended with a compromise mediated by the Holy See: Andrew asked Béla to pardon him, and Béla restored him to his position of archbishop.

Upon Béla's invitation, Cistercian monks came from France and set up new Cistercian abbeys at Egres, Zirc, Szentgotthárd and Pilis between 1179 and 1184. In the 1180s, Béla initiated the building of a lofty royal castle and a new cathedral in Esztergom. Nevertheless, he was almost always wandering around the country. According to an inscription on a brick found in Bulkeszi (now Maglić in Serbia), Béla sponsored the baptism of a German ""guest settler"" in that village.

In the imperial court of Constantinople, Béla learnt the importance of a well-organized administration. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, Béla ""introduced the same form of addressing petitions as was customary in the Roman and imperial court"", which suggests that the Royal Chancery began functioning as a separate office during his reign. He emphasized the importance of written records, ordering in 1181 that a charter was to be issued for all transactions proceeding in his presence.

Emperor Manuel I died on 24 September 1180. Within six months, Béla had restored his suzerainty in Dalmatia, but no detailed contemporaneous accounts of the events exist. The citizens of Split ""returned to Hungarian lordship"" soon after Manuel's death, according to the 13th-century Thomas the Archdeacon. Zadar also accepted Béla's suzerainty in early 1181. Historian John V. A. Fine writes that Béla retook suzerainty of Dalmatia ""seemingly without bloodshed and with imperial consent"", because the Byzantine authorities preferred that Béla rule the province rather than the Republic of Venice.

The details of the reconquest of Syrmium are also obscure. Andronikos Komnenos accused the mother of the young Byzantine Emperor, Alexios II, of inciting Bélaher brother-in-lawto ravage the region of Belgrade and Barancs (now Braničevo in Serbia) in May 1182, implying that Béla had by that time occupied Syrmium. In the same month, Andronikos Komnenos captured the Dowager Empress and had her murdered by the end of the year. Taking advantage of the emerging anarchy in the Byzantine Empire, Béla advanced as far as Niš and Serdica in the first half of 1183. In Sardica, he seized the casket containing the relics of Saint Ivan of Rila, and ordered it ""to be transported with great honors to his land and to be laid down with honor in the church"" of Esztergom, according to the saint's Life from the Sofia Prologue. Makk writes that Béla withdrew from the regions south of the Danube, but historian Paul Stephenson says that Béla preserved these lands.

Andronikos Komnenos murdered Emperor Alexios II in late 1183. The contemporaneous Eustathius of Thessalonica writes that Andronikos's opponents sent letters to many monarchs, including Béla III, urging them to attack Andronikos. According to Ansbert and other Western European chroniclers, Béla invaded the Byzantine Empire in early 1185. After Andronikos I fell in September, Béla signed a peace treaty with the new emperor, Isaac II Angelos. Isaac married Béla's daughter, Margaret, and Béla granted the region of Niš and Barancs to Isaac as his daughter's dowry. The relics of Saint Ivan of Rila were also returned to Sardica on this occasion. Béla married Margaret of France, a sister of Philip II of France, in the summer of 1186.

Orio Mastropiero, Doge of Venice, laid siege to Zadar in 1187, but the Venetian fleet could not seize the well-fortified town. Vladimir Yaroslavich, Prince of Halych, fled to Hungary at the end of 1188, because his boyars had rebelled. Roman Mstyslavych, Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia, soon occupied Halych, but Béla invaded the principality and expelled him. Instead of restoring Vladimir Yaroslavich to his former position, Béla imprisoned him and granted control of Halych to Andrew, who was Béla's younger son. As a token of his conquest, Béla styled himself as King of Galicia. .

In the summer of 1189, German crusaders marched through Hungary under the command of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Béla welcomed Frederick, and dispatched a troop to escort the crusaders across the Balkan Peninsula. At Frederick's request, Béla released his imprisoned brother, Géza, who joined the crusaders and left Hungary. Béla mediated a peace treaty between Frederick I and Isaac II, whose mutual distrust had almost caused war between the German crusaders and the Byzantines.

Vladimir Yaroslavich escaped from captivity in early 1189 or 1190. With the assistance of Casimir II of Poland, he expelled Andrew from Halych, and regained control of the principality. In 1191, Béla met his son-in-law, Isaac II, in Philippopolis (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria) and Syrmium, but the results of their negotiations remained unknown. Upon Béla's request, the Holy See approved the canonization of Ladislaus I of Hungary in 1192. Béla invaded Serbia at the beginning of 1193. Isaac II demanded the withdrawal of his troops, and threatened Béla with war. At the same time, Doge Enrico Dandolo attempted to occupy Zadar, but failed. In 1193, Béla granted Modruš County in Croatia to Bartholomew of Krk, a member of the Frankopan family. This is the earliest certain example of an office being granted as a hereditary dignity in the Kingdom of Hungary.

Last years (1194–1196) 
In 1194, Béla appointed his eldest son, Emeric, who had already been crowned as the future king, to administer Croatia and Dalmatia. After a united Bulgarian, Cumanian and Vlach army defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of Arcadiopolis in 1194, Béla was willing to assist the Byzantine Empire. However, his campaign was cancelled, because Béla's son-in-law, Emperor Isaac II, was dethroned by Alexios III Angelos in April 1195. Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, was planning to launch a campaign against the Byzantine Empire on behalf of the dethroned emperor, but Béla prohibited his subjects from joining Henry.

Béla took the cross as a token of his desire to lead a crusade to the Holy Land. However, he could not fulfill his oath, because he fell ill and died on 23 April 1196. He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Cathedral. His remains were confidently identified by archeologists during 19th-century excavations, because a contemporaneous sourceRichard of Londonwrote of Béla's exceptional height. Béla's skeleton shows that he was  tall. Béla's remains were reinterred at the Matthias Church in Budapest. The DNA from skeletal remains of Béla and of another presumed member of the Árpád dynasty, scholars propose that the dynasty belonged to Y-haplogroup R1a subclade R-SUR51 > R-ARP.

Family 

Béla's first wife, Agnes, was the daughter of Raynald of Châtillon, Prince of Antioch, and Raynald's wife, Constance of Antioch. Agnes was born around 1149 and died around 1184. At the time of her marriage in 1170, she was renamed Anna in Constantinople.

Béla's and Agnes-Anna's first child, Emeric, was born in 1174. Emeric's sister, Margaret, who was renamed Maria in Constantinople, was born in 1175. At the age of nine or ten, she was given in marriage to the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who was about 30 at the time. Maria's husband died in 1204, before the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Margaret–Maria married one of the leaders of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat, who seized Thessaloniki after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Historian Makk writes that in about 1210, Maria married Nicholas I of Saint Omer after the death of Boniface, but scholar Peter Lock says that Saint Omer's wife and Margaret–Maria were not identical.

The second son of Béla and Agnes-Anna, Andrew, was born around 1177. His two younger brothers, Solomon and Stephen, did not survive infancy. Their younger sister, Constance, married King Ottokar I of Bohemia in about 1198. A third daughter of Béla and Agnes-Anna, whose name is unknown, died in infancy.

After the death of Agnes-Anna, Béla proposed to Theodora, a granddaughter of Emperor Manuel I's sister, Theodora Komnene. However, a synod of the Byzantine Church forbade the marriage in 1185, because Theodora had entered a nunnery. In late 1185 or at the beginning of 1186, Béla asked for the hand of Matilda of Saxony, a daughter of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, but Henry II of England, Matilda's grandfather, hindered this marriage. Finally, Béla married Henry II's widowed daughter-in-law, Margaret of France, in the summer of 1186. She was the daughter of Louis VII of France. Queen Margaret outlived Béla, and moved to the Holy Land after his death.

Legacy 
Béla was one of the most eminent medieval monarchs of Hungary. His ""rule not only represented the apogee of the kingdom of the Árpádians, but also marked the end of an epoch"", according to historian Pál Engel. His establishment of the Royal Chancery contributed to the ""expansion of written records"" in Hungary; the first charters issued by barons appeared in the 1190s. According to a contemporaneous list of Béla's revenues, his yearly income amounted to almost 170,000 marks (about 23 tonnes of pure silver). If the list is reliable, his income surpassed the revenues of the contemporaneous Kings of France and England, but the reliability of the list has been questioned by many historians, including Pál Engel.

In about 1190, after a fire destroyed Esztergom, Béla invited French masons to rebuild the royal palace and the cathedral. The masons introduced new architectural forms; the new royal palace and cathedral were the earliest examples of Gothic architecture in Central Europe. Coins depicting a two-barred cross, which was primarily used in the Church of the Byzantine Empire, were minted from around 1190, suggesting that the so-called ""double cross"" became part of the Hungarian royal heraldry under Béla III.

170,36683952,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier-Talk,Soldier-Talk,"Soldier-Talk is the third studio album by the American experimental rock band The Red Crayola. It was released in 1979 by the record label Radar. By this time, Thompson had moved the project to London and expanded the band for this album to include Lora Logic of X-Ray Spex and Essential Logic and all of the members of Pere Ubu.

Background 
Since the release of God Bless the Red Krayola and All Who Sail With It, Steve Cunningham had left the project to pursue his own musical ambitions and had been replaced by Jesse Chamberlain. In 1978, this incarnation of the band was touring regularly and had been signed to Radar Records. While in Europe, Thompson met Pere Ubu, who were touring in support of The Modern Dance, and struck up a friendship.

Composition 
Despite the presence of Pere Ubu, the music is a close continuation of the sound previously established by The Red Crayola. Soldier-Talk was conceived as a concept album dealing with militarism.

Chamberlain wanted to veer the music towards a more pop-oriented direction while Thompson opted to keep the sound experimental. As Thompson explained, ""There wasn't much for him to do, in a way, I think he wanted to say what he felt about the record, and he wanted it closer in the direction of pop, because Jesse, that's always been one of his gifts, and I was determined to make the record work, and thought that it could, and should, and working with Geoff Travis, using his insights into the way music works, there was no other way it could be..."" The conflict  caused a strain on their musical partnership, although they later worked again on another record in a similar vein, Three Songs on a Trip to the United States, the cover of which referenced Soldier-Talk.

Release 
Soldier-Talk was released in 1979. Around the release of the album, Mayo Thompson became an active producer for many of the bands on the Rough Trade roster, including Stiff Little Fingers, The Fall and The Raincoats. He also became a member of Pere Ubu, filling the spot left after Tom Herman's departure, and recorded the albums The Art of Walking and Song of the Bailing Man with the group.

Reception 

Thom Jurek of AllMusic declared it ""among the loopiest of the Red Krayola's offerings"", and representative of ""post-punk's more musically adventurous side"". He gave the album three out of five stars, describing the songs as being independently compelling and engaging. Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork gave the album 5.3 out of 10 and was critical towards the overall abrasiveness of the music, writing, ""It's a consistently interesting album – there's something trying to get your attention at every moment, but in the manner of a beloved little sibling who won't stop poking you."" He concluded that the record was best suited for those who find Gang of Four's Entertainment! too subdued.

Legacy 
The bass guitarist Mike Watt named Soldier-Talk one of his favorite rock albums.

His research is divided between the application of critical education theory to university media programs and the study of contemporary popular music and society.

Born Stanislaw Dzieniszewski in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the family name was changed in the early 1950s), Denski attended Father Judge High School. He graduated from Clarion University of Pennsylvania with B.S. and M.S. degrees in Communication.  In the mid-1970s he was a staff video producer and director producing instructional television programming for Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College in Logan and Williamson, WV.  In 1990 he received his Ph.D. in Mass Communication (with minors in philosophy and film) jointly from the School of Telecommunications and the Scripps Howard School of Journalism at Ohio University.

In 1986-1987 Denski was a visiting lecturer in Media Studies at The College of Wooster in Wooster, OH.  From 1987-1990, he was resident lecturer in Media Studies in the Department of Communication Studies at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis.  From 1990 until 1997 he was Assistant Professor of Media Studies and Director of the Telecommunication Program at IUPUI. In 1993 he was awarded the N.E.T. (National Excellence in Teaching) Grant for $6,000 award to design the course, Introduction to Communication Studies.

In February 1994, he was selected to attend the IRTS International Radio & Television Society) Faculty/Industry Seminar in New York City where his design group won the $1,000 prize for best program design. In May 1995 he was an Invited Visiting Scholar at Ohio University in Athens, OH and presented a series of lectures to Mass Communication faculty and doctoral students.

His published works include the book,  Media Education and the (Re)production of Culture (1994, with David Sholle) and numerous journal articles and book chapters. He currently sits on the Advisory Board of the journal Popular Music & Society.

In 1993 he founded Aether Records, an Indiana-based record label that released both vinyl reissues of rare rock records from the 1960s and 1970s and music by contemporary bands on CD and LP.  In 1996, Aether/OR Music became a wholesale distribution and retail mail order company with warehouse and offices based in Indianapolis, IN.  In 1997 Denski left his academic position to take the position of President of Aether/OR Music which he held until February 2002.

As writer on popular music, Denski has written liner notes for numerous LPs and CDs (including the notes for all 10 volumes of the compilation series, Love, Peace & Poetry), his music writing has been published in the Dallas Observer, the Cleveland Scene, Patrick Lundborg's Acid Archives, and he was a contributing critic to the  2007 Village Voice Pazz & Jop Poll.

Denski is also a musician, recording artist and producer, working with artists like Jello Biafra and Nick Saloman. In 1997 he formed the band Many Bright Things, releasing three albums between 1996 and 2005 in addition to one album under the name In The Summer Of The Mushroom Honey in 1998.  In 2002 he produced the compilation album, Pull Up the Paisley Covers: A Psychedelic Omnibus.

In 2007 and 2008 Denski was employed as the researcher and ghost writer for Think Secure, the online blog of Frank DeFina, then president of Panasonic Systems Solutions America.

Since 2007 Denski has maintained his own blog, These Things Too, featuring new writing on music, politics and the arts.

Reception

The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek called it ""a swinging affair"" stating ""While there are edges and some outrageous improvisation, Steve Potts (right channel) and Steve Lacy (left channel) keep this firmly in the Monk-ian jazz vein. ... Given that these men played together for such a long time, that there is such instantaneous call and response should not be a surprise. However, there is also something to be said for restraint, and the pair practice that here as well. This is a blowing date to be sure, with lots of interesting and remarkable improvisation, but both men are interested primarily in using their instruments to carry 'song,' which they did to the delight of the Swiss audience who heard them, and anyone who encounters this recording"".

It is endemic to Colombia and only known from its type locality, Betulia, Santander, on the western flank of the Cordillera Oriental. It is only known from the holotype collected in 2001.

Description
The holotype is an adult male measuring  in snout–vent length. The head is broader than body. The snout is subacuminate dorsally and sloping in lateral view. The supratympanic fold obvious and obscuring upper edge of the tympanum that is otherwise round. Skin is smooth apart from the flanks that are granular. Fingers have no lateral fringes nor discs, whereas the toes bear prominent discs. The dorsum is dark brown, and there is a pale brown line running along the canthus rostralis to the tip of the snout. The throat and abdomen are dark gray. The feet are dirty yellow under. The iris is dark and has some metallic golden flecks.

Habitat and conservation
The holotype was found in leaf litter in mature cloud forest at  above sea level. Specific threats to this species are unknown, but it is presumably impacted by habitat loss caused by smallholder farming and subsistence wood extraction.

Unlike many variations that appear only in analysis, Tarrasch actually sprung his traps against masters in tournament games.

Tarrasch Trap in the Open Variation 
Two masters actually fell for this trap against Tarrasch: Johannes Zukertort at Frankfurt in 1887 and Isidor Gunsberg at Manchester in 1890.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. 0-0 Nxe4
This is the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez.

6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. c3 Be7 10. Re1 0-0 11. Nd4 Qd7 (see diagram)
Falling into the trap.

12. Nxe6
No matter how Black recaptures, the pawn on d5 will be pinned (along the d-file or along the a2–g8 diagonal). After 12...Qxe6 or 12...fxe6 White wins a piece with 13.Rxe4.

Tarrasch Trap in the Steinitz Variation 
The second Tarrasch Trap, sometimes referred to as the Dresden Trap, occurs in the Steinitz Variation. Tarrasch published analysis of this trap in 1891, but 18 months later Georg Marco fell into it in Tarrasch versus Marco, Dresden 1892. Tarrasch spent just five minutes thinking during the entire game.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6
This is the Steinitz Variation of the Ruy Lopez.

4. d4 Bd7
Black breaks the pin to meet the threat of 5.d5.

5. Nc3 Nf6 6. 0-0 Be7 7. Re1 (see diagram)
Laying a subtle trap. Castling seems natural for Black but it loses a pawn. Instead, 7...exd4 is better.

7... 0-0? 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. Qxd8 Raxd8 11. Nxe5
Black's best move here is probably 11...Bd7, although White would remain a pawn ahead.

11... Bxe4 12. Nxe4 Nxe4
White can go astray too, 13.Rxe4?? would be a horrible blunder as Black would checkmate with 13...Rd1+ 14. Re1 Rxe1#. White blocks that possibility with his next move, making the threat real against the black knight on e4.

13. Nd3 f5
The black knight cannot move because of the pin against the bishop on e7.
 
14. f3 Bc5+?!
Better is 14...Bh4 15.g3 Nxg3 16.hxg3 Bxg3 where Black get two pawns for the knight.

15. Nxc5 Nxc5 16. Bg5 Rd5 17. Be7 Re8 18. c4 1–0
White wins at least the exchange, so Marco resigned.

178,1220165,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Vincent%20Holland,John Vincent Holland,"John Vincent Holland VC (19 July 1889 – 27 February 1975), was World War I Irish soldier, and the recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Early life and education
Holland was born into a middle-class family in Athy, County Kildare, the son of veterinary surgeon John Holland and Catherine Peppard. He was educated first at Clongowes Wood College and later at Liverpool University, and was one of 600 Old Clongovians to enlist in the army during World War One.

World War 1
On the outbreak of war he enlisted in the 2nd Life Guards in November 1914 undergoing his training in Cumbermere Barracks Windsor. After a short time with the Life Guards he was granted a commission with the 3rd Battalion of the Leinster Regiment. In March 1915 he was attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and was then wounded in August and returned to England and Ireland to convalesce, but it wasn't long until he was back in France and back with the 7th Battalion Leinster Regiment serving as battalion bombing officer.

On 3 September 1916, during the Somme Offensive, whilst engaged in intense combat in the vicinity of the village of Guillemont, Holland was awarded the Victoria Cross for the following action:

""During a heavy engagement, Lt. Holland, not content with bombing hostile dug-outs, fearlessly led his troops through our own artillery barrage and cleared a great part of the village in front. He started out with 26 troops and finished with only five after capturing some 50 prisoners. By this gallant action he undoubtedly broke the spirit of the enemy and saved many casualties.""

Holland was subsequently promoted to Captain. During the war he was also Mentioned in Dispatches and received a personal ""Hickie Parchment"" from his Divisional General-Officer-Commanding, Major-General William Hickie, in recognition of his bravery in action.

Later life
In 1917, Holland married Frances Grogan at the cathedral in Cork City. Together they had two sons: Major Niall V. Holland (d. 1944), who was killed in Burma during the Second World War and Norman J. Holland.

He was seconded for service with the Indian Army in the rank of Lt. 31st October 1919. On the 13th November 1919 he was appointed on probation to the Indian Army as a Captain, an appointment that was confirmed on the 27th November 1920.  In September 1922 he retired from the army. 
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Holland again commissioned, serving as administrative officer of the 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, then re-joined the Indian Army but was invalided out in 1941. He then took up a position with the Ministry of Food. In 1956, Holland and his wife emigrated to Hobart, in Tasmania.

Death
Holland died in Hobart in February 1975 at the age of 86. His body was buried in Cornelian Bay Cemetery, with military honours. His wife, Frances, pre-deceased him, dying in 1960. Holland lived to see the birth of his great-grandchild.

Tribute
On 3 September 2009 a memorial plaque was unveiled at Guillemont Church in France dedicated to the memory of the three soldiers who won Victoria Crosses in the fighting at the village during the Somme in 1916, Holland's name being one of the three.

180,14894608,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number%20matching,Number matching,"Number matching or matching numbers is a term often used in the collector car industry to describe cars with original major components, or major components that match one another.

Many times these major components contain dates, casting numbers, model numbers, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN), stamped numbers, or codes that can match the original components that were on the car when it was new.

Definition
The term ""number matching"" (or ""matching numbers"") is a term used in the collector car industry to describe the authenticity of collectible or investment quality cars. Number matching generally means that a particular car still contains its original major components or has major components that match exactly the major components the car had when it was new. These ""major components"" are not always agreed on. The appearance of a number matching car likely could not be distinguished from an original car.

Major components
These are parts such as the engine, transmission, rear-axle assembly, and frame of the car, with intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, body panels, and carburetors sometimes also considered.  Many times these components contain dates, casting numbers, model numbers, VIN, stamped numbers, or codes that can match the original components that were on the car when it was new.
The definition can often vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, as well as from country to country. Often parts such as transmissions and rear-axles will be common across a range of models and as such do not carry any stamped link to the car it was originally installed in.
It is widely accepted however that the minimum requirement for a vehicle to be Number matching (or matching numbers, depending on your local terminology) is for the original Chassis number and/or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to match to the engine block and the data tags.

Minor components
These are parts that are commonly replaced due to regular wear and tear. Parts such as the interior fabric, paint, chrome trim, brakes, instruments, electrical components and wiring are considered minor components and generally do not affect the value of the car.

Verification
The numbers or casting dates on the major components of a car would be present and fall in a particular order.
For example, an engine's assembly date would be before the build date of the car, and the casting dates would be before the assembly date of the engine because an engine assembly date (the date the engine was assembled, usually at a different location) could not be after the assembly date of the whole car. Engines are assembled prior to being installed in the car at the factory. Therefore, the assembly date of the car would have to be after the assembly date of the engine. Casting dates (the dates formed in the metal of a component at the foundry) could not be after the assembly date of the engine. And casting dates would be well in advance of the assembly date of the engine. Numbers and dates track an accurate history of how a car was built and when and where the car and the parts used to create the car were made.

If a car has number matching major components it helps define how collectible a car is. Number matching cars typically will have a much greater value than non-number matching cars, because they are much rarer than non-number matching cars, and are seen as a more accurate description of how the car was built.

182,3611720,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort%20Presque%20Isle,Fort Presque Isle,"Fort Presque Isle (also Fort de la Presqu'île) was a fort built by French soldiers in summer 1753 along Presque Isle Bay at present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, to protect the northern terminus of the Venango Path.  It was the first of the French posts built in the Ohio Country, and was part of a line that included Fort Le Boeuf, Fort Machault, and Fort Duquesne.

History
The fort was built as part of the French military occupation of the Ohio Country; rival claims to the area by the British led to the French and Indian War.  After the 1759 British victory at the Battle of Fort Niagara, the French burned the fort and retreated from the area. There is a marker at E Front St and Parade Street commemorating the site, which was located amongst the houses in the southeast corner of E Front and Parade.

The British built a new Fort Presque Isle, which was captured by American Indians during Pontiac's Rebellion. On June 19, 1763, the fort was surrounded by about 250 Ottawas, Ojibwas, Wyandots, and Senecas. After holding out for two days, the garrison of approximately sixty men surrendered on the condition that they could return to Fort Pitt. Most were instead killed after emerging from the fort.

General Anthony Wayne first arrived in the area of Presque Isle in 1786.  In 1795, 200 Federal troops from Wayne's army, under the direction of Captain John Grubb, built a blockhouse on Garrison Hill (located in front of then Garrison Grounds), in  present-day Erie, Pennsylvania.  Also named Fort Presque Isle, the blockhouse was used as part of a defense against Native American uprisings.  It was also used during the War of 1812. General Wayne was stricken ill at Fort Presque Isle and died there in 1796. At his request, his body was buried under the flagpole of the northwest blockhouse of the fort.  This blockhouse burned in 1852.  In 1880, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania reconstructed the blockhouse at Second and Ash Streets, Erie, as a memorial to General Wayne.  The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has recognized the reconstructed blockhouse as eligible for placement on the National Register of Historic Places.  The blockhouse is located at N 42° 08.400, W 80° 04.463. The site is now within the grounds of Pennsylvania Soldiers' and Sailors' Home and last rebuilt in 1984.

Originally established as a crown corporation in 1947.  Today the company is one of the largest producers of anhydrous sodium sulphate in North America with production capability of 285,000 tons per year. The company has won the Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies award.

Originally established in 1947 by the government of Tommy Douglas the company remained a crown corporation until privatized in 1988 by the government of Grant Devine. The primary plant has operated in  Chaplin, Saskatchewan since that time.  A second plant operated at Mossbank, Saskatchewan from 1954 until 1984 and third plant operated at Ingebrigt, Saskatchewan from 1966 until 1984.  During the 1980s, the market shifted to requiring higher purity sodium sulphate (primarily for use in detergents) resulting in the upgrade of the original Chaplin plant and shutting down the plants producing lower grade material.  The Ingebrigt facility remained in a standby condition 

In 2013 the company's name was updated to Saskatchewan Mining and Minerals Inc.

190,2261473,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleib%20bei%20uns%2C%20denn%20es%20will%20Abend%20werden%2C%20BWV%206,"Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6","(Stay with us, for evening falls), 6, is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach for use in a Lutheran service. He composed it in Leipzig in 1725 for Easter Monday and first performed it on 2 April 1725.

The prescribed readings for the feast day were Peter's sermon from the Acts of the Apostles, and the Road to Emmaus narration from the Gospel of Luke. The text by an anonymous librettist begins with a line from the gospel, and includes as the third movement two stanzas from Philipp Melanchthon's hymn """" and its second stanza by Nikolaus Selnecker. The text ends with the second stanza of Martin Luther's hymn """". Derived from the gospel scene, the topic is pleading for light in a situation of threatening darkness.

Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboes, strings and continuo. The extended opening chorus is formed like a French overture and has been compared to Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine, the last chorus of Bach's St John Passion.

History and text 
In 1723, Bach was appointed as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, where he was responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. He took office in the middle of the liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden for Second Day of Easter as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.

The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the sermon of Peter (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the Road to Emmaus (). Bach used a text by an anonymous poet who had already supplied librettos for his first cycle. The poet took verse 29 from the Gospel of Luke as a starting point: the two disciples ask the stranger whom they met on their way to stay with them, as darkness is about to fall. The situation represents the position of the Christian in general. The librettist chose two stanzas from """" for the third movement, one written by Philipp Melanchthon as a German version of """", and of similar content as the first movement, and the other the hymn's second stanza which was added by Nikolaus Selnecker. The closing chorale is the second stanza of Martin Luther's hymn """" (Maintain us, Lord, within thy word). The text, of rather dry and didactic quality, is focused on the contrast between light and dark, viewing Jesus as the light of a sinful world.

Bach first performed the cantata on 2 April 1725.

Music

Scoring and structure 
Bach structured the cantata in six movements. The first and last are set for choir, while the inner movements are set for soloists, in a sequence of aria – chorale – recitative – aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: two oboes (Ob), oboe da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), violoncello piccolo (Vp) and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece was stated as 26 minutes by Bach scholar Alfred Dürr but most currently available recordings last about 20 minutes.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Dürr's book about the cantatas, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.

Movements

1 
The cantata opens with """" (Abide with us; for it is toward evening), a large-scale tripartite chorus, reminiscent of a slow sarabande or of the closing Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine of the St John Passion. The instruments, a choir of three oboes and strings, present a theme which Dürr describes as ""of speech-like gestures"". It is picked up by the voices, first in homophony. The vocal lines in this movement descend on """" (for evening is nigh) ""as if the gloom of night were weighing upon them"". While the beginning of the movement has no tempo marking, the middle section is marked Andante and in Alla-breve time, suggesting a faster pace. The voices, accompanied first only by the continuo, perform a fugue on two subjects at the same time: ""denn es will Abend werden"" (for it is toward evening) and ""und der Tag hat sich geneiget"" (and the day is far spent). A third motif, long notes on the same pitch, illustrates the ""abiding"" or staying. The movement is closed by a shortened reprise of the beginning. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the slow-fast-slow structure of the movement to the French overture and notes that it opens a new series of cantatas. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes the similarity to the last chorus Ruht wohl from Bach's St John Passion, describing the cantata's ""tender pleadings which become ever more gestural and urgent for enlightenment in a darkening world from which Jesus' presence has been removed.""

2 
The second movement, """" (Highly praised Son of God), is a da capo aria for the alto, accompanied by an obbligato oboe da caccia, which was replaced by viola in later performances. Dürr describes the choice of voice and obbligato in the same range as unusual and ""of special charme"". The opening phrase is illustrated by an upward line, while the mention of falling darkness is interpreted by downward whole-tone steps.

3 
The third movement, """" (Ah remain with us, Lord Jesus Christ), is a setting of the chorale with a virtuoso part for violincello piccolo. This movement was later adapted as one of the Schübler Chorales, BWV 649.

4 
The only recitative is for bass, """" (The darkness has taken over in many places). Its ""threatening chromatic bass line"" reminds the listeners of ""the gravity of the situation"".

5 
The last aria, """" (Jesus, let us look upon You), is for tenor with string accompaniment. It is characterised by a persistent walking rhythm, somewhat mitigated by the flowing triplets in the violin line. Hofmann notes that the lively violin figures illustrate from the start the text about the ""light of the Word of God shining more brightly"", which appears only in the second part.

6 
The four-part closing chorale, """" (Reveal Your strength, Lord Jesus Christ,), chorale is ""quarried very little for musical building blocks"", according to Julian Mincham, ending the work on a sombre tone.

194,18367242,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legbourne%20Road%20railway%20station,Legbourne Road railway station,"Legbourne Road was a railway station on the East Lincolnshire Railway which served the village of Legbourne in Lincolnshire between 1848 and 1964. The station was closed to passengers in 1953, and withdrawal of goods facilities took place in 1964. The line through the station closed in 1970. The station once housed a museum containing railway memorabilia; this closed in 1998 and the building is once again a private residence.

History
The station was opened on 3 September 1848 as Legbourne after the village of Legbourne which lies to the east on what is now the A157 road, and renamed in May 1880 in an acknowledgement that there was some distance between the village and the station. It was constructed by Peto and Betts civil engineering contractors who, in January 1848, had taken over the contract to construct the section of the East Lincolnshire Railway between  and  from John Waring and Sons. This section was the last to be completed in September 1848, at an agreed cost of £123,000 (). The line passed over two level crossings before it reached Legbourne village: the first over the A157 and the second over Mill Lane. The station was situated to the south of the first crossing which, despite its distance from the village, was possibly chosen because it was the more important of the two roads crossed.

As with other stations on the line, Legbourne was provided with staggered platforms situated either side of the crossing; a signal box lay on the northern side of the crossing and as well as controlling the gates, also regulated access to the two sidings on the side adjacent to the crossing, which were the station's only goods facilities. The station did not handle livestock. The stationmaster's house is similar in style to that found at other stations on the line and was sited adjacent to the crossing on the down side. The July 1922 timetable saw four up and down weekday services, plus one Sunday service each way, call at Legbourne Road. The station was closed to passengers on 7 December 1953, one of the first such closures on the East Lincolnshire Line, but goods facilities (downgraded to an unstaffed public siding) remained for a further ten-and-a-half years until 15 June 1964.

Present day
The platforms were removed before closure and the signal box was demolished in December 1970. The main station building was later restored by Mike Legge as a museum housing a collection of railwayana. The museum acquired a signal box which had controlled the crossing of the Alford and Sutton Tramway by the Mablethorpe Loop Line at a point on the edge of Sutton-on-Sea. The box had survived the closure of both lines and had remained in the middle of a field until the 1980s. A large Great Northern-style building was constructed near the main station building; this is not original, but was built for the museum. The museum closed in 1998 upon the retirement of the owners and the contents auctioned, but the station remains in good condition as a private residence with the signal box visible from the road.

198,18747862,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbury%20Historic%20District,Newbury Historic District,"The Newbury Historic District encompasses the historic town center of Newbury, Massachusetts.  Centered on the town's upper green, the area has a history of more than 350 years, and includes buildings dating to the 17th century.  It extends from the green northward on High Street to the town line with Newburyport.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Description and history
The town of Newbury was incorporated in 1635, with a town center originally further along the Parker River.  The present upper green was laid out in 1642 as a militia training ground, and became the new center of the town (which then included both Newburyport and West Newbury).  The first meetinghouse was built in 1646 on a site at the green's northwest corner, where subsequent churches stood until the present 1869 First Parish Church was built across High Road.   The First Parish Cemetery was also laid out in 1646, and is where many of Newbury's early settlers are buried.  The green was used as an encampment side during the American Revolutionary War by forces under the command of Benedict Arnold, en route to Quebec in 1775.

The historic district is bounded on the south by the upper green, and the buildings that face it on High Road, Green Street, and Hanover Street.  It then extends northward along High Road to the present town line with Newburyport (separated from Newbury in 1764).  Most of the buildings in the district are residential wood frame structures.  Notable among these are the Swett-Ilsley House and the Coffin House, two 17th-century houses that are now museum properties of Historic New England.  The district also includes Newbury's town hall (c. 1935) and the 1898 Woodbridge School, built on the homesite of the town's first schoolteacher, John Woodbridge.

Although this disease was known before Wegener's description, from the 1950s onwards it was generally referred to as Wegener's granulomatosis.

Biography

Early life
Friedrich Wegener was born on 7 April 1907 in Varel, Oldenburg, Germany. His father was a doctor and his mother a Swedish gymnastic director.

Pre-World War II years

World War II Era
More detail about aspects of Wegener's biography during the Nazi regime first became available in 2006. Wegener joined the Nazi Party in 1932. Specifically, he was a member of the Sturmabteilung, a paramilitary branch of the Nazi party which participated in violent conflicts. As a relatively high-ranking military physician, he spent some of World War II in a medical office three blocks from the Łódź Ghetto, a Jewish ghetto in Łódź, Poland.  He conducted autopsies on Jewish concentration camp inmates and the facility he worked in performed experiments on prisoners. There is no direct evidence of active participation of Wegener in these human experiments, but it is likely he was aware of them. The United Nations War Crimes Commission had a legal mandate against Friedrich Wegener and the Polish Institute for the Prosecution of German War Crimes confirmed that he had appeared on the central list of war criminal and security suspects. Wegener was released without a trial as no charges were brought against him. In an editorial in 2006 the evidence was regarded as “thin but tangible.""

Medical contributions
In 1936, Friedrich Wegener described the disease that once bore his name, Wegener disease, as systemic disorder characterized by aseptic vasculitis granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis which affects the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys. WG is a relatively rare disorder, occurring in 1/25,000 persons. After revelations about his Nazi Party past became common knowledge, the disease has been referred to as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA).

The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) awarded Wegener a “master clinician” prize in 1989.  After his Nazi past was discovered in 2000, the ACCP rescinded the prize and campaigned to rename Wegener's granulomatosis to ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis. More recently, several professional societies, including the American College of Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American Society of Nephrology, proposed the name 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis' in a 2011 editorial. The new name for the condition is now widely adopted in the scientific literature and by institutions and charities.

206,1711143,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory%20license,Compulsory license,"A compulsory license provides that the owner of a patent or copyright licenses the use of their rights against payment either set by law or determined through some form of adjudication or arbitration. In essence, under a compulsory license, an individual or company seeking to use another's intellectual property can do so without seeking the rights holder's consent, and pays the rights holder a set fee for the license. This is an exception to the general rule under intellectual property laws that the intellectual property owner enjoys exclusive rights that it may license – or decline to license – to others.

Under UK patent law, a compulsory license is different from a statutory license. Under statutory license, the rate is fixed by law, whereas in case of compulsory license, the rate is left to be negotiated or decided in court.

Copyright law 

In a number of countries, copyright law provides for compulsory licenses of copyrighted works for specific uses. In many cases the remuneration or royalties received for a copyrighted work under compulsory license are specified by local law, but may also be subject to negotiation. Compulsory licensing may be established through negotiating licenses that provide terms within the parameters of the compulsory license. Essentially compulsory licensing provide that copyright owners may only exercise the exclusive rights granted to them under copyright law in a certain way and through a certain system.

Berne Convention 
Article 11bis(2) and Article 13(1) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works provide the legal basis for compulsory licensing at the international level. They specify under which conditions members to the Berne Convention may determine or impose conditions under which exclusive rights may be exercised, for example through compulsory licensing. The Berne Convention states that member states are free to determine the conditions under which certain exclusive rights may be exercised in their national laws. They also provide for the minimum requirements to be set when compulsory licenses are applied, such as that they must not prejudice the author's right to fair compensation.

Article 11bis(2)states that:

It shall be a matter for legislation in the country of the Union to determine the conditions under which the rights mentioned in the preceding paragraph may be exercised, but these conditions shall apply only in the countries where they have been prescribed. They shall not in any circumstances be prejudicial to the moral rights of the author, nor to his right to obtain equitable remuneration which, in the absence of agreement, shall be fixed by competent authority.

The ""preceding article"" mentioned in Article 11bis(2) is Article 11bis(1), which establishes that:

Authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorising: (i) the broadcasting of their works or the communication thereof to the public by any other means of wireless diffusion of signs, sounds or images; (ii) any communication to the public by wire or by rebroadcasting of the broadcast of the work, when this communication is made by an organisation other than the original one; (iii) the public communication by loudspeaker or any other analogous instrument transmitting, by signs, sounds or images, the broadcast of the work.

Article 13(1) states that:

Each country of the Union may impose for itself reservations and conditions on the exclusive right granted to the author of a music work and to the author of any words, the recording of which together with the music work has already been authorised by the latter, to authorise the sound recording of that musical work, together with such words, if any; but all such reservations and conditions shall apply only in the countries which have imposed them and shall not, in any circumstances, be prejudicial to the rights of these authors to obtain equitable remuneration which, in the absence of agreement, shall be fixed by competent authority.

In addition to the exclusive rights mentioned in Article 11bis(1) and 13(1) the Berne Convention also provides that members may determine or impose such conditions for the exercise of exclusive rights in cases where an exclusive right is not provided as remuneration right and not as an exclusive right of authorisation, for example in the case of the resale right, or droit de suite (Article 14ter), and the so-called ""Article 12 rights"" of performers and producers of phonograms. Members to the Berne Convention may also determine or impose such conditions where the restriction of an exclusive right to the mere right to remuneration is allowed, for example the right to reproduction (Article 9(2)), and in the case of ""residual rights"", that is, a right to remuneration, usually for authors or performers, that survives the transfer of certain exclusive rights.

United States
There are several different compulsory license provisions in United States copyright law, including for non-dramatic musical compositions, public broadcasting, retransmission by cable systems, subscription digital audio transmission, and non-subscription digital audio transmission such as Internet radio. The compulsory license for non-dramatic musical compositions under Section 115 of the Copyright Act of 1976  allows a person to distribute a new sound recording of a musical work, if that has been previously distributed to the public, by or under the authority of the copyright owner. There is no requirement that the new recording be identical to the previous work, as the compulsory license includes the privilege of rearranging the work to conform it to the recording artist's interpretation. This does not allow the artist to change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work. In order to take advantage of this compulsory license the recording artist must provide notice and pay a royalty. The notice must be sent to the copyright owner, or if unable to determine the copyright owner, to the Copyright Office, within thirty days of making the recording, but before distributing physical copies. Failure to provide this notice would constitute copyright infringement. In addition to the notice to the copyright owner, the recording artist must pay a royalty to the copyright owner. This royalty is set by three copyright royalty judges. Though the compulsory license allows one to make and distribute physical copies of a song for a set royalty, the owner of the copyright in the underlying musical composition can still control public performance of the work or transmission over the radio. If the underlying musical work is well known, the work can be licensed for public performance through a performance rights organization such as ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC.

According to Register of Copyrights, Marybeth Peters, use of the section 115 license prior to the 1995 enactment of the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act was extremely rare, with the U.S. Copyright Office receiving fewer than 20 notices of such licenses per year.  By 2003, that number had risen to 214, which, while higher, was not considered by the Register to be significant.

Patents

Many patent law systems provide for the granting of compulsory licenses in a variety of situations. The Paris Convention of 1883 provides that each contracting State may take legislative measures for the grant of compulsory licenses. Article 5A.(2) of the Paris Convention reads:
Each country of the Union shall have the right to take legislative measures providing for the grant of compulsory licenses to prevent the abuses which might result from the exercise of the exclusive rights conferred by the patent, for example, failure to work. (See also Article 5A.(3) to (5) of the Paris Convention.)

According to historian Adrian Johns, the idea of compulsory licensing ""seems to have originated as a serious proposition in the 1830s, although predecessors can be traced back into the eighteenth century,"" and it was popular in the British anti-patent movement of the 1850s and 1860s. More recently an area of fierce debate has been that of drugs for treating serious diseases such as malaria, HIV and AIDS. Such drugs are widely available in the western world and would help to manage the epidemic of these diseases in developing countries.  However, such drugs are too expensive for developing countries and generally protected by patents.

United States
In the United States, if the federal government or one of its contractors infringes a patent, the only remedy available to patent holders is a lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims. It is the policy of the U.S. Department of Defense to allow contractors to infringe patents and to defend the contractor against patent infringement claims at government expense. Use of this provision by agencies other than Department of Defense is rare. During the 2001 anthrax attacks through the US Postal Service, the US government threatened to issue a compulsory license for the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin, if the patent owner, Bayer, didn't lower the price to the government. Bayer lowered the price and the government backed down on the threat.

India
In India, compulsory license may be issued by the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks under section 84(1) of The Patents Act, 1970, if:

 The reasonable requirements of the public with respect to the patented invention have not been satisfied, or,
 the patented invention is not available to the public at a reasonably affordable price, or,
 the patented invention is not worked in the territory of India.

In March 2012, India granted its first compulsory license ever to Indian generic drug manufacturer Natco Pharma for Sorafenib tosylate, a cancer drug patented by Bayer.

Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) 
The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) also sets out specific provisions that shall be followed if a compulsory license is issued, and the requirements of such licenses.  All significant patent systems comply with the requirements of TRIPs. The principal requirement for the issue of a compulsory license is that attempts to obtain a license under reasonable commercial terms must have failed over a reasonable period of time.  Specific situations in which compulsory licenses may be issued are set out in the legislation of each patent system and vary between systems.  Some examples of situations in which a compulsory license may be granted include lack of working over an extended period in the territory of the patent, inventions funded by the government, failure or inability of a patentee to meet a demand for a patented product and where the refusal to grant a license leads to the inability to exploit an important technological advance, or to exploit a further patent. TRIPs also provides that the requirements for a compulsory license may be waived in certain situations, in particular cases of national emergency or extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. Article 31.f of TRIPS requires that compulsory licenses be used ""predominantly"" for local markets, a requirement that complicates the ability of countries to import drugs manufactured overseas.

Doha Declaration 
This issue of compulsory licensing of drugs treating serious diseases was addressed by the Doha Declaration which recognized the problem and required the TRIPs council to find a solution. On 17 May 2006 the European Commission's official journal published Regulation 816/2006, which brings into force the provisions of the Doha Declaration. This means that the declaration now has legal effect in the European Union, and also in Canada who implemented it in 2005.  The declaration allows compulsory licenses to be issued in developed countries for the manufacture of patented drugs, provided they are exported to certain countries (principally, those on the UN's list of least-developed countries and certain other countries having per-capita incomes of less than US$745 a year). This is not limited to only least-developed countries - every country that is a member of the WTO has the right under the TRIPs agreement to issue a compulsory license if there is a public health need. Some countries simply choose not to issue these licenses. From the text of the agreement: ""Each member has the right to grant compulsory licences and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licences are granted.""

Bonnie Doon was gradually settled from the 1870s onwards. The western part of Bonnie Doon became a part of the City of Strathcona in 1907 and became a part of Edmonton when Strathcona and Edmonton merged in 1912.  The rest of the neighbourhood was annexed by Edmonton the following year.

""Bonnie Doon"" is a phrase in a Robbie Burns poem, and refers to the River Doon in Scotland. In 1910, Ontario-born Alexander Cameron Rutherford who was of Scottish descent put the name on land he owned east of Mill Creek. Later the name spread to what is now the entire neighbourhood of Bonnie Doon.

It is the heart of Edmonton's Franco-Albertan community and hosts the only francophone university west of Manitoba, the University of Alberta's Campus Saint-Jean, which is located north of Whyte Avenue on Rue Marie-Anne Gaboury (91 Street) and the only Francophone high school west of Winnipeg, École Maurice-Lavallée.

The neighbourhood is also home to one of Edmonton's earliest shopping malls, Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre.

The neighbourhood extends from Connors Road in the north to Whyte (82) Avenue in the south, and from Mill Creek Ravine in the west to 83 Street in the east.

There are two schools in the neighbourhood: Rutherford Elementary School and École Maurice-Lavallée.

Surrounding neighbourhoods include: Strathearn to the north, Idylwylde and Holyrood to the east, and King Edward Park to the south.  These neighbourhoods are sometimes collectively referred to as the Bonnie Doon area.  In the river valley to the north of Bonnie Doon is the neighbourhood of Cloverdale.

The community is represented by the Bonnie Doon Community League, established in 1918, which maintains a community hall and an outdoor rink located at 93 Street and 92 Avenue.

Demographics 
In the City of Edmonton's 2019 municipal census, Bonnie Doon had a population of  living in  dwellings, an 11.17% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of  people/km2 in 2012.

Education
Campus Saint-Jean of the University of Alberta is in Bonnie Doon. The French-language public school board Conseil scolaire Centre-Nord has its headquarters in the La Cité Francophone complex.

Gold tegus grow to be about 2 to 3 ft (60 to 100 cm) long on average, and up to 3.5 to 4.0 kg in weight, with a glossy body, powerful limbs and a thick tail. They have many black and gold stripes down their bodies. Gold tegus live in the tropical forests of northern and central South America, as well as in Panama. They feed on insects, other invertebrates, small mammals, other reptiles and birds, as well as fish and sometimes fruit. They typically do not make as good a pet as their larger southern relatives, the Argentine black and white tegu or the red tegu, but if handled frequently, they can make a good pet.

216,1791004,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytalovo,Pytalovo,"Pytalovo (; ) is a town and the administrative center of Pytalovsky District in Pskov Oblast, Russia, located on the Utroya River (a tributary of the Velikaya),  southwest of Pskov, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 

It was previously known as Pytalovo or Novo-Dmitrovskoye (until 1925), Jaunlatgale (until 1938), Abrene (until 1945).

Etymology
Accounts of the origin of Pytalovo's name reflect the region's dichotomy. The unofficial Pytalovo website offers two theories about the origin of the town's name. One is that it was named after Lieutenant Pytalov, a guard to Catherine the Great, who received the lands in 1766 for reasons unknown, that estate subsequently being sold off by his descendants. The other is that the name is derived from the Russian verb """" (meaning ""to torture""), named after a church courtyard with a large iron cross used to torture and execute people.

Another theory is that Pytalovo is Russified form of the Latvian toponym ""Pietālava"" (Latvian ""pie Tālavas"", or Latgalian ""pī Tuolavas""), meaning ""near Tālava"", with Tālava being the name of an ancient Latvian feudal state. Russophones comprised the majority of the population in a number of parishes during Latvia's initial independence, with further Russification ongoing. Nevertheless, the older generation testified to their Latvian heritage.<ref name=""Krasnais"">Latviskā Jaunlatgale' , V. Krasnais, ""Latviskā Jaunlatgale, Apgabala Vēsturiskie Likteņi, retrieved June 22, 2013; also available at ; local community leader A. Briedis recounted during the period: ""Nevertheless, the older generation in these parishes completely confirms that in older times they had spoken Latvian and that the Russians had called them Latvians. But now, as the older generation passes on, children are being educated in Russian schools as Russians even under Latvia"".</ref> Historian Carl von Stern wrote of a cultural awakening amongst the region's inhabitants in the 1930s despite generations of Russification. Two thousand inhabitants from across Pskov gathered in September 1934 and proclaimed: ""We are not Russian, but, indeed, Latvian. We are returning to our Latvian heritage. Latvians, lend us your helping hand, support and hasten our return!"" Audiences wept as they heard old familiar folk songs sung with words and a language lost over time. A more concrete testament to Pytalovo's Latvian heritage is that the Latvian folk costumes of the region are the only ones which still preserve the most ancient tradition of white dress, once used in both daily life and for festive occasions.

History

Pytalovo, alternatively known as Novo-Dmitrovskoye (), a rural locality in Vyshgorodok volost, Ostrovsky Uyezd, Pskov Governorate, had been known since the end of the 18th century. In the last quarter of the 19th century, it had a population of 59. It grew significantly after gaining a railway station by a newly constructed railway branch.

In February 1918 the German Army advances on Pskov and Petrograd capturing Pytalovo until fall 1918, when the Red Army retakes it. In May 1919 г. advancing pro-czarist Russian North-Western Army of Gen. Nikolai Yudenich supported by Estonian and Latvian republican units recaptures westernmost part of the Pskov Governorate. The frontline as of noon the 1st of February 1920 was stipulated as the border demarcation line by the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty of 1920 between Latvian Republic and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

By the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty of 1920, a part of Ostrovsky Uyezd, including Pytalovo, was passed to Latvia. In 1925, Latvians renamed it Jaunlatgale, which it was known as until 1938, when the name was changed to Abrene. In 1933, it was granted town status. During the interwar period, it was the administrative center of Abrene District. After the annexation of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1940, the town originally remained a part of the Latvian SSR. During World War II, the town was occupied by the German Army from July 5, 1941 until July 22, 1944 and administered as part of the Generalbezirk Lettland of Reichskommissariat Ostland. On January 16, 1945, the town and the surrounding areas were transferred to Pskov Oblast of the Russian SFSR and Pytalovsky District was established. At the same time, the town's original name (Pytalovo) was restored.

Whether the region is historically Russian or Latvian became a highly politicized issue after Latvia restored its independence in 1991 and a border dispute erupted with Russia over the region. The Abrene District, constituting roughly 2% of Latvia's territory, was transferred to the Russian SFSR in 1945, but it had originally been a part of Russia and ceded to Latvia only a quarter century earlier, in 1920. Russian President Vladimir Putin infamously proclaimed in 2005 that Latvia ""will get the ears of a dead donkey but not Pytalovo [Abrene]"". The border dispute was not resolved until 2007, when a treaty between Latvia and Russia recognizing the existing border was signed.

Administrative and municipal status
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Pytalovo serves as the administrative center of Pytalovsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Pytalovo is incorporated within Pytalovsky Municipal District as Pytalovo Urban Settlement.

Economy
Industry
As of 2003, only two industrial enterprises survived in Pytalovo—a textile factory and a printing house. A milk factory and a flax production factory, previously the biggest enterprises in the district, were defunct.

Transportation

Pytalovo is an important railway station on the railway from St. Petersburg via Pskov to Rēzekne in Latvia and further to Vilnius. In Pytalovo, another railway to Gulbene and Riga branches off west. As of 2012, there was passenger traffic on the railway.

Pytalovo has an easy access to the European route E262, from Ostrov to Kaunas via Rēzekne and Daugavpils.

It is 62 km long connecting GST Road at Perungalathur, GST Road at Vandalur, NH 48 (GWT Road) at Nazarethpettai, NH 716 (CTH Road) at Thiruninravur to NH 16 (GNT Road) at Vijayanaallur and to TPP road at Minjur. On 29 August 2010, the then Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister M. K. Stalin laid the foundation for the first phase of the project from Vandalur to Nemilichery covering a distance of 30 kilometres (19 mi). The Chennai ORR generally covers Avadi North, West and East, Redhills, Minjur and Tambaram neighbourhoods. Chennai Outer ring road had a plan of Chennai metro rail CMRL which is going to build up at gap between two roads.

Phases
The project was developed in 2 phases with 2 segments each.

Phase 1
The Phase 1 of the project covers a distance of 29.65 km. 10 Grade separators at major junctions have been planned along this route. It also includes 50 bus bays on both sides and also truck lay-byes for parking of around 100 trucks. Phase I of this project was implemented by GMR, and the project was originally expected to be completed by June 2012. Phase I was thrown open to the public on 29 August 2014 the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu J. Jayalalithaa through Video conferencing.

Segment I
The Segment I extends from GST Road (Vandalur) to NH48 (Nazarethpettai) covering a distance of 19.7 km. The development covers an area of about 265.38 Hectares.

Segment II
The Segment II extends from NH48 (Nazarethpettai) to CTH Road (Pattabiram) covering a distance of 9.5 km. The development covers an area of about 140.9 Hectares.

Phase II
The Phase 2 covers a distance of 33.1 km.

Segment III
The Segment III extends from CTH Road (Pattabiram) to GNT Road (Redhills) covering a distance of 18.8 km. The development covers an area of about 258.02 Hectares.

Planned Developments (PPP mode)
Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) has done a micro market study on the development of 50 m along the road. It has suggested that the components of the development could include a 5-star hotel, retail segments – including an ""auto main street"" where the ORR connects industrial suburbs that house automobile giants such as Hyundai, Ford and Renault Nissan – and facilities like multiplex, residential, hospital, commercial, warehouse and green spaces. Developers would be identified through open competitive bidding for these projects.

High-Growth Zone
The region close to NH-45 is seen as a high-growth area covering the Chennai neighbourhoods places Vandalur, Mannivakkam, Mudichur, Thiruninravur, Pattabiram, Muthapudupet, Morai, Malayambakkam-Mangadu, Minjur and Ponneri (Smart City). This would be the location for a 5-star hotel.

Auto Main Street
Localities near Minjur and Ponneri, which are hubs of automobile and component industries, would be the ideal locale for the auto main street, which is a niche retail for the automobile industry for which about  have been earmarked.

Residential Areas
Residential areas have been planned for more than 150 acres near Minjur, Ponneri while residential spaces have been planned at Malayambakkam, Nazarethpettai, Agaramel and Poonamallee.

Warehouse
A major warehouse has been planned in Minjur, Nemilichery (near Pattabiram).

Logistics Park
Pattabiram would have a logistics facility.

Project Status
June 2015:
 GMR — NAPC has been awarded the contract for development of Phase I of ORR. First phase is to cost about 1,100 crores.
 Project will be completed by November 2020

February 2021:
 Road has been opened completely for public use on 8th Feb 2021.

He was a member of the Supreme People's Assembly and served as the Minister of Post and Telecommunications beginning in 2012. He has not been seen in public since October 2014, when he and six other officials disappeared in a purge connected to Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. He was reportedly executed, though his death is unconfirmed.

Early life and education 
Sim was born on 5 July 1960. He studied at the Faculty of Automation at Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang between September 1982 and August 1987, where he received his Master of Engineering.

Career 
From September 1987 to April 1995, Sim was the chief engineer at the Central Info-Communication Bureau. From May 1995 to November 2008, he worked as a manager and director of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. In December 2008, he was made Vice Minister of Post and Telecommunications, a position he held until December 2011. In 2010, he was named a member of the Central Auditing Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea.

In January or February 2012, he became Minister of Post and Telecommunications. In that office, one of his main roles was overseeing the North Korean mobile phone network, Koryolink. In April 2013, he was reconfirmed as minister by the 13th Supreme People's Assembly. This was the last time he appeared in state media. In March 2014, Sim was elected to the Supreme People's Assembly for the Ongjin constituency. He, along with other close associates of the late Kim Jong-il, were reportedly put in the Assembly to help maintain a stable relationship between Kim Jong-un and older leading officials.

2014 purge and reported execution 
On 23 October 2014, a source told the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo that they had received ""reliable information"" that six minister-level officials had been purged from the government and executed. Among the ministers listed were Sim, Ma Won-chun, General Ri Pyong-chol, Chang Ung, and Ri Yong-gil. Sim did not appear often in state media, but his absence from a meeting of North Korean officials with Naguib Sawiris, head of the Egyptian company Orascom Telecom, which provides North Korea's mobile network, was considered unusual. He has not been seen publicly since 2014, but his execution remains unconfirmed.

Personal life 
Sim was married with two children. He spoke both Korean and English.

221,569572,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo%20Revolt,Pueblo Revolt,"The Pueblo Revolt of 1680, also known as Popé's Rebellion or Popay's Rebellion, was an uprising of most of the indigenous Pueblo people against the Spanish colonizers in the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, larger than present-day New Mexico. The Pueblo Revolt killed 400 Spaniards and drove the remaining 2,000 settlers out of the province. The Spaniards reconquered New Mexico twelve years later.

Background
For more than 100 years beginning in 1540, the Pueblo people of present-day New Mexico were subjected to successive waves of soldiers, missionaries, and settlers. These encounters, referred to as entradas (incursions), were characterized by violent confrontations between Spanish colonists and Pueblo peoples. The Tiguex War, fought in the winter of 1540–41 by the expedition of Francisco Vásquez de Coronado against the twelve or thirteen pueblos of Tiwa Native Americans, was particularly destructive to Pueblo and Spanish relations.

In 1598 Juan de Oñate led 129 soldiers and 10 Franciscan priests, plus a large number of women, children, servants, slaves, and livestock, into the Rio Grande valley of New Mexico.  There were at the time approximately 40,000 Pueblo Native Americans inhabiting the region. Oñate put down a revolt at Acoma Pueblo by killing and enslaving hundreds of the Native Americans and sentencing all men 25 or older to have their foot cut off. The Acoma Massacre would instill fear of and anger at the Spanish in the region for years to come, though Franciscan missionaries were assigned to several of the Pueblo towns to Christianize the natives.

Spanish colonial policies in the 1500s regarding the humane treatment of native citizens were often ignored on the northern frontier. With the establishment of the first permanent colonial settlement in 1598, the Pueblos were forced to provide tribute to the colonists in the form of labor, ground corn, and textiles. Encomiendas were soon established by colonists along the Rio Grande, restricting Pueblo access to fertile farmlands and water supplies and placing a heavy burden upon Pueblo labor. Especially egregious to the Pueblo was the assault on their traditional religion. Franciscan priests established theocracies in many of the Pueblo villages. In 1608, when it looked as though Spain might abandon the province, the Franciscans baptized seven thousand Pueblos to try to convince the Crown otherwise. Although the Franciscans initially tolerated manifestations of the old religion as long as the Puebloans attended mass and maintained a public veneer of Catholicism, Fray Alonso de Posada (in New Mexico 1656–1665) outlawed Kachina dances by the Pueblo people and ordered the missionaries to seize and burn their masks, prayer sticks, and effigies.  The Franciscan missionaries also forbade the use of entheogenic substances in the traditional religious ceremonies of the Pueblo. Several Spanish officials, such as Nicolas de Aguilar, who attempted to curb the power of the Franciscans were charged with heresy and tried before the Inquisition.

In the 1670s drought swept the region, causing a famine among the Pueblo and increased raids by the Apache, which Spanish and Pueblo soldiers were unable to prevent. Fray Alonso de Benavides wrote multiple letters to the King, describing the conditions, noting ""the Spanish inhabitants and Indians alike to eat hides and straps of carts"". The unrest among the Pueblos came to a head in 1675. Governor Juan Francisco Treviño ordered the arrest of forty-seven Pueblo medicine men and accused them of practicing ""sorcery"". Four medicine men were sentenced to death by hanging; three of those sentences were carried out, while the fourth prisoner committed suicide. The remaining men were publicly whipped and sentenced to prison. When this news reached the Pueblo leaders, they moved in force to Santa Fe, where the prisoners were held. Because a large number of Spanish soldiers were away fighting the Apache, Governor Treviño was forced to accede to the Pueblo demand for the release of the prisoners.  Among those released was a San Juan (""Ohkay Owingeh"" in the Tewa Language) native named ""Popé"".

Rebellion

Following his release, Popé, along with a number of other Pueblo leaders (see list below), planned and orchestrated the Pueblo Revolt.  Popé took up residence in Taos Pueblo far from the capital of Santa Fe and spent the next five years seeking support for a revolt among the 46 Pueblo towns.  He gained the support of the Northern Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Tano, and Keres-speaking Pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley.  The Pecos Pueblo, 50 miles east of the Rio Grande pledged its participation in the revolt as did the Zuni and Hopi, 120 and 200 miles respectively west of the Rio Grande. The Pueblos not joining the revolt were the four southern Tiwa (Tiguex) towns near Santa Fe and the Piro Pueblos south of the principal Pueblo population centers near the present day city of Socorro. The southern Tiwa and the Piro were more thoroughly integrated into Spanish culture than the other groups. The Spanish population of about 2,400, including mixed-blood mestizos, and native servants and retainers, was scattered thinly throughout the region. Santa Fe was the only place that approximated being a town.  The Spanish could only muster 170 men with arms. The Pueblos joining the revolt probably had 2,000 or more adult men capable of using native weapons such as the bow and arrow.  It is possible that some Apache and Navajo participated in the revolt.
 

The Pueblo revolt was typical of millenarian movements in colonial societies. Popé promised that, once the Spanish were killed or expelled, the ancient Pueblo gods would reward them with health and prosperity. Popé's plan was that the inhabitants of each Pueblo would rise up and kill the Spanish in their area and then all would advance on Santa Fe to kill or expel all the remaining Spanish.  The date set for the uprising was August 11, 1680. Popé dispatched runners to all the Pueblos carrying knotted cords.

Each morning the Pueblo leadership was to untie one knot from the cord, and when the last knot was untied, that would be the signal for them to rise against the Spaniards in unison.  On August 9, however, the Spaniards were warned of the impending revolt by southern Tiwa leaders and they captured two Tesuque Pueblo youths entrusted with carrying the message to the pueblos.  They were tortured to make them reveal the significance of the knotted cord.

Popé then ordered the revolt to begin a day early. The Hopi pueblos located on the remote Hopi Mesas of Arizona did not receive the advanced notice for the beginning of the revolt and followed the schedule for the revolt. On August 10, the Puebloans rose up, stole the Spaniards' horses to prevent them from fleeing, sealed off roads leading to Santa Fe, and pillaged Spanish settlements. A total of 400 people were killed, including men, women, children, and 21 of the 33 Franciscan missionaries in New Mexico. In the rebellion at Tusayan (Hopi) churches at Awatovi, Shungopavi, and Oraibi were destroyed and the attending priests were killed. Survivors fled to Santa Fe and Isleta Pueblo, 10 miles south of Albuquerque and one of the Pueblos that did not participate in the rebellion. By August 13, all the Spanish settlements in New Mexico had been destroyed and Santa Fe was besieged. The Puebloans surrounded the city and cut off its water supply. In desperation, on August 21, New Mexico Governor Antonio de Otermín, barricaded in the Palace of the Governors, sallied outside the palace with all of his available men and forced the Puebloans to retreat with heavy losses. He then led the Spaniards out of the city and retreated southward along the Rio Grande, headed for El Paso del Norte. The Puebloans shadowed the Spaniards but did not attack. The Spaniards who had taken refuge in Isleta had also retreated southward on August 15, and on September 6 the two groups of survivors, numbering 1,946, met at Socorro. About 500 of the survivors were Native American slaves. They were escorted to El Paso by a Spanish supply train. The Puebloans did not block their passage out of New Mexico.

Popé's land 

The retreat of the Spaniards left New Mexico in the power of the Puebloans. Popé was a mysterious figure in the history of the southwest as there are many tales among the Puebloans of what happened to him after the revolt. Later testimony to the Spanish by the Pueblo people was probably colored by anti-Popé sentiments and a desire to tell the Spanish what they wanted to hear.

Apparently, Popé and his two lieutenants, Alonso Catiti from Santo Domingo and Luis Tupatu from Picuris, traveled from town to town ordering a return ""to the state of their antiquity."" All crosses, churches, and Christian images were to be destroyed.  The people were ordered to cleanse themselves in ritual baths, to use their Puebloan names, and to destroy all vestiges of the Roman Catholic religion and Spanish culture, including Spanish livestock and fruit trees. Popé, it was said, forbade the planting of wheat and barley and commanded those natives who had been married according to the rites of the Catholic Church to dismiss their wives and to take others after the old native tradition.

The Puebloans had no tradition of political unity. Popé was a man of trust and strict policy. Therefore, each pueblo was self-governing, and some, or all, apparently resisted Popé's demands for a return to a pre-Spanish existence. The paradise Popé had promised when the Spanish were expelled did not materialize. A drought continued, destroying Puebloan crops, and the raids by Apache and Navajo increased. Initially, however, the Puebloans were united in their objective of preventing a return of the Spanish.

Popé was deposed as the leader of the Puebloans about a year after the revolt and disappears from history. He is believed to have died shortly before the Spanish reconquest in 1692.

Spanish attempt to return

In November 1681, Antonio de Otermin attempted to return to New Mexico. He assembled a force of 146 Spanish and an equal number of native soldiers in El Paso and marched north along the Rio Grande. He first encountered the Piro pueblos, which had been abandoned and their churches destroyed. At Isleta pueblo he fought a brief battle with the inhabitants and then accepted their surrender. Staying in Isleta, he dispatched a company of soldiers and natives to establish Spanish authority. The Puebloans feigned surrender while gathering a large force to oppose Otermin. With the threat of a Puebloan attack growing, on January 1, 1682 Otermin decided to return to El Paso, burning pueblos and taking the people of Isleta with him. The first Spanish attempt to regain control of New Mexico had failed.

Some of the Isleta later returned to New Mexico, but others remained in El Paso, living in the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo. The Piro also moved to El Paso to live among the Spaniards, eventually forming part of the Piro, Manso, and Tiwa tribe.

The Spanish were never able to re-convince some Puebloans to join Santa Fe de Nuevo México, and the Spanish often returned seeking peace instead of reconquest. For example, the Hopi remained free of any Spanish attempt at reconquest; though they did, at several non-violent attempts, try for unsuccessful peace treaties and unsuccessful trade agreements. For some Puebloans, the Revolt was a success in its objective to drive away Spanish influence.

Reconquest

The Spanish return to New Mexico was prompted by their fears of French advances into the Mississippi valley and their desire to create a defensive frontier against the increasingly aggressive nomadic tribes on their northern borders.  In August 1692, Diego de Vargas marched to Santa Fe unopposed along with a converted Zia war captain, Bartolomé de Ojeda. De Vargas, with only sixty soldiers, one hundred Indian auxiliaries or native soldiers, seven cannons (which he used as leverage against the Pueblo inside Santa Fe), and one Franciscan priest, arrived at Santa Fe on September 13.  He promised the 1,000 Pueblo people assembled there clemency and protection if they would swear allegiance to the King of Spain and return to the Christian faith. After a while the Pueblo rejected the Spaniards. After much persuading, the Spanish finally made the Pueblo agree to peace.  On September 14, 1692, de Vargas proclaimed a formal act of repossession. It was the thirteenth town he had reconquered for God and King in this manner, he wrote jubilantly to the Conde de Galve, viceroy of New Spain.  During the next month de Vargas visited other Pueblos and accepted their acquiescence to Spanish rule.

Though the 1692 agreement to peace was bloodless, in the years that followed de Vargas maintained increasingly severe control over the increasingly defiant Pueblo. De Vargas returned to Mexico and gathered together about 800 people, including 100 soldiers, and returned to Santa Fe on December 16, 1693.   This time, however, 70 Pueblo warriors and 400 family members within the town opposed his entry.  De Vargas and his forces staged a quick and bloody recapture that concluded with the surrender and execution of the 70 Pueblo warriors on December 30, and their surviving families (about 400 women and children) were sentenced to ten years' servitude and distributed to the Spanish colonists as slaves. 

In 1696 the residents of fourteen pueblos attempted a second organized revolt, launched with the murders of five missionaries and thirty-four settlers and using weapons the Spanish themselves had traded to the natives over the years; de Vargas's retribution was unmerciful, thorough and prolonged.  By the end of the century the last resisting Pueblo town had surrendered and the Spanish reconquest was essentially complete. Many of the Pueblos, however, fled New Mexico to join the Apache or Navajo or to attempt to re-settle on the Great Plains. One of their settlements has been found in Kansas at El Cuartelejo.

While the independence of many pueblos from the Spaniards was short-lived, the Pueblo Revolt gained the Pueblo people a measure of freedom from future Spanish efforts to eradicate their culture and religion following the reconquest. Moreover, the Spanish issued substantial land grants to each Pueblo and appointed a public defender to protect the rights of the Native Americans and argue their legal cases in the Spanish courts.  The Franciscan priests returning to New Mexico did not again attempt to impose a theocracy on the Pueblo who continued to practice their traditional religion.

In the arts

The 1994 Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ""Journey's End"" references the Pueblo Revolt, in the context of ancestors of different characters having been involved in the revolt.

In 1995, in Albuquerque, La Compañía de Teatro de Albuquerque produced the bilingual play Casi Hermanos, written by Ramon Flores and James Lujan.  It depicted events leading up to the Pueblo Revolt, inspired by accounts of two half-brothers who met on opposite sides of the battlefield.

A statue of Po'Pay by sculptor Cliff Fragua was added to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the US Capitol Building in 2005 as one of New Mexico's two statues.

In 2005, in Los Angeles, Native Voices at the Autry produced Kino and Teresa, an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet written by Taos Pueblo playwright James Lujan.  Set five years after the Spanish Reconquest of 1692, the play links actual historical figures with their literary counterparts to dramatize how both sides learned to live together and form the culture that is present-day New Mexico.

In 2010, students Clara Natonabah, Nolan Eskeets, Ariel Antone, members of the Santa Fe Indian School Spoken Word Team wrote and performed their spoken word piece telling the story of the Pueblo Revolt, ""Po'pay"" to critical acclaim in New Mexico and the US. The team performed in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The track can be found on iTunes.

 Australian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Australian passport 7th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Canada) according to the Henley Passport Index.

Besides visa requirements, most countries specify other requirements for the entry of Australian and other citizens into their countryfor example, that a prospective entrant has no criminal history or health issues, or that there is evidence of sufficient funds or of a ticket for exit.

Visa requirements map

Visa requirements
Each country has a multitude of visa types, each with its particular purpose and requirements. Rules for visits by ordinary passport holders are as follows:

Dependent, disputed, or restricted territories
Unrecognized countries

Dependent and autonomous territories

Other territories

Reciprocity issues
Some countries regard Australia's requirement for obtaining an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) prior to travel as being equivalent to offering visa-free travel when deciding whether to grant the same to Australians wishing to enter their territory. The United States, for example, offers their Visa Waiver Program to Australian passport-holders, and one of the conditions for joining this scheme is that ""Governments provide reciprocal visa-free travel for U.S. citizens for 90 days for tourism or business purposes"". However, the United States has required from January 2009 a similar ETA from citizens of Australia and some more countries. This system is not called a visa, but Electronic System for Travel Authorization, therefore the USA still allows visa-free travel for Australians. As of December 1998, Japan has also granted visa-free access to Australians. Other ETA eligible countries and territories including Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea (90 days) and Taiwan (90 days) also grant visa-free access to Australians while Brunei grants Australians a 30-day visa on arrival.

Additional rules

Visa exemptions for Schengen states

A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of more than three months (but no more than three months in any individual member state)
The Australian Government has signed bilateral visa waiver agreements with a number of the individual countries who are Schengen signatories, which allow Australian citizens to spend up to three months in the relevant country, without reference to time spent in other Schengen signatory states. Since these agreements continue to remain valid despite the implementation of the Schengen agreement, the European Commission has confirmed that in practice if Australians visit Schengen countries which have signed these types of bilateral agreements with Australia, then the terms of these agreements override the conditions normally imposed as a result of the Schengen visa exemption agreement. However, amendments are under consideration to restrict exit from the Schengen area only through the territory of the Member State which is a Contracting Party to the bilateral agreement and the authorities of which have extended the stay.

Australia has individual bilateral visa waiver agreements with the following Schengen signatories:

Consequently, Australian citizens can visit the above Schengen member states visa-free for periods of up to three months in each country. If, however, an Australian citizen then visits another Schengen state not included in the list above, the restriction of no more than three months out of a six-month period in the Schengen area as a whole applies. Therefore, if an Australian citizen has already spent three months in one or more of the above Schengen countries, any visits to another Schengen country without a bilateral visa waiver agreement with Australia may lead to difficulties with local law enforcement agencies (e.g. being accused of having overstayed upon leaving a Schengen country which is not in the list above).

Australian citizens are classified as 'Annex II' foreign nationals, and so are permitted to stay visa-free in the 26 member states of the Schengen Area as a whole — rather than each country individually — for a period not exceeding 3 months every 6 months.

During the visa exemption period, Australian citizens are permitted to work in Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden. In addition, Australian citizens intending to stay and work in Estonia for up to 90 days can do so without a visa as long as the employer has completed a 'registration of short-term employment'.

A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of more than 3 months (and more than 3 months in an individual member state)
In general, any person who is not a European Union, European Economic Area or Swiss citizen and who wishes to stay in a Schengen member state for more than 3 months is required to obtain a national long-stay 'D' visa and/or a residence permit. Australian citizens aged 18–30 (or 18–35 in some cases) are able to obtain a national long-stay 'D' visa and/or a residence permit from some Schengen member states on the basis of a working holiday (see below). Schengen member states also issue national long-stay 'D' visas and residence permits for other reasons to those fulfilling criteria laid out in their national immigration policies (e.g. skilled workers, students, au pair).

In general, the national long-stay 'D' visa/residence permit needs to be obtained in advance through the member state's embassy/consulate. However, some Schengen member states offer exceptions for Australian citizens.

 allows Australian citizens to enter the country without a visa and to apply for a temporary residence permit or a 'Red-White-Red Card' (issued to permanent immigrants) after arrival, rather than in advance through an Austrian embassy/consulate.

The  allows Australian citizens to apply for a work visa under a special scheme known as a 'Green Card' (rather than a 'Blue Card' or work permit which is required by most non-EU citizens). The application for a Green Card can be lodged at any Czech embassy/consulate (or, in some circumstances, within the Czech Republic if the applicant is already resident there) and is usually processed within 60 days. Note that 'Green Cards' are no longer issued after 24 June 2014.

 permits Australian citizens intending to stay in the country for over 3 months to enter without a visa and to apply for a residence permit after arrival (whilst for many other non-EEA and Swiss citizens, a residence permit and visa for a stay over 3 months must be applied for in advance at a German foreign mission).

 permits Australian citizens to stay and work in Estonia for more than 90 days but less than 6 months as long as they obtain a category 'D' long-stay visa at a cost of €80 in advance at an Estonian foreign mission after the employer has completed a 'registration of short-term employment'. Australian citizens intending to stay and work in Estonia for more than 6 months can apply for a temporary residence permit for employment after arrival in the country.

 allows Australian citizens who wish to stay for more than 90 days in the country to apply for a residence card from the regional directorate of the Office of Immigration and Nationality within 90 days of arrival and do not need to obtain a residence permit prior to arrival in Hungary (unlike most other non-EEA and Swiss foreign nationals).

 permits Australian citizens intending to stay in the country for over 3 months as self-employed persons or as businesspersons to enter Latvia without a visa and to apply for a residence permit after arrival (whilst for many non-EEA and Swiss citizens, an application for a residence permit must be lodged in advance at a Latvian foreign mission).

 exempts Australian citizens from the requirement to obtain a Schengen category ""D"" visa (the visa issued for long term stays in The Netherlands of over 90 days, known in Dutch as the ""MVV"" visa) - an exemption which goes beyond the visa waiver afforded to most other non-EEA and non-Swiss foreign nationals who are usually only given a visa waiver of up to 90 days in a 180-day period.

 permits Australian citizens who have qualifications as a skilled worker to stay in the country without a visa for up to 6 months to seek employment as a skilled worker or a specialist (except as a religious leader/teacher or an ethnic cook), as long as they register with the police within 3 months of arriving in Norway.

Visa exemptions and requirements for the United Kingdom
Australian citizens are able to visit the United Kingdom for up to 6 months (or 3 months if they enter from the Republic of Ireland) without the need to apply for a visa as long as they fulfil all of the following criteria:
 they do not work during their stay in the UK
 they must not register a marriage or register a civil partnership during their stay in the UK
 they can present evidence of sufficient money to fund their stay in the UK (if requested by the border inspection officer)
 they intend to leave the UK at the end of their visit and can meet the cost of the return/onward journey
 they have completed a landing card and submitted it at passport control unless in direct transit to a destination outside the Common Travel Area
 if under the age of 18, they can demonstrate evidence of suitable care arrangements and parental (or guardian's) consent for their stay in the UK

However, even though, strictly speaking, they are not required to apply for a visa if they satisfy all of the above criteria, an Australian citizen who falls into any of the following categories has been strongly advised by the UK Border Agency (replaced by UK Visas and Immigration) to apply for a visa prior to travelling to the UK if they:
 have any unspent criminal convictions in any country
 have previously been refused or breached the terms of any entry to the UK, or been deported or otherwise removed from the UK
 have previously applied for a visa and been refused one
 have been warned by a UK official that they should obtain a visa before travelling to the UK

Australian citizens who were born before 1983  and qualify for the right of abode are able to live and work in the United Kingdom indefinitely.

Australian citizens with a grandparent born either in the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or Isle of Man at any time or in the Republic of Ireland on or before 31 March 1922 can apply for UK Ancestry Entry Clearance, which enables them to work in the UK for five years, after which they can apply to settle indefinitely.

Australian citizens aged 18 to 30 can apply for a Youth Mobility Scheme visa which allows them to pursue a working holiday in the UK for two years. In June 2021, the Australian and UK governments announced that their reciprocal working holiday scheme would soon be expanded to allow citizens of both countries aged 18 to 35 live and work in the other country for up to three years. These changes are expected to occur from 2022.

Visa exemption for New Zealand
By virtue of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australian citizens are exempt from the requirement to hold a permit on arrival in New Zealand and may reside or work for an indefinite period as long as:
 they present a valid Australian passport OR hold a foreign passport showing their Australian Citizen Endorsement or Australian Citizen Declaratory Visa (either with a label or a confirmation letter) as evidence of their Australian citizenship
 they have no criminal convictions
 they have no untreated tuberculosis
 they have not been deported, excluded or removed from any country

Travel ban

It is an offence for Australians to travel or remain in Declared Areas.

APEC Business Travel Card

Holders of an APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC)  travelling on business do not require a visa to the following countries:

1 – up to 90 days
2 – up to 60 days
3 – up to 59 days

The card must be used in conjunction with a passport and has the following advantages:
no need to apply for a visa or entry permit to APEC countries, as the card is treated as such (except by  and )
undertake legitimate business in participating economies
expedited border crossing in all member economies, including transitional members
expedited scheduling of visa interview (USA)

Consular protection of Australian citizens abroad

There are currently over 100 Australian missions overseas.

In some countries Australians may also receive consular assistance from Canadian missions under the Canada–Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement.

225,4036525,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand%20Duchess%20%28solitaire%29,Grand Duchess (solitaire),"Grand Duchess (also known as Duchess de Luynes) is a solitaire card game which is played with two decks of playing cards. It is a two deck game in the  Sir Tommy family.  One unique feature of this game is the building of the reserve, which is not used until the entire stock runs out.

Rules
First, four cards are dealt face-up, one onto each tableau pile, and two more cards are dealt face-down on the reserve to be used later. After each deal of six cards, the player pauses to see if any cards are playable. Available for play to the foundations (which are above the four tableau piles) are the top cards of each tableau pile.

As they become available, one ace and one king of each suit are placed in the foundations. The aces are built up to kings while the kings are built down to aces, all by suit. Furthermore, once a foundation card is set, any can be built upon it at any time.

Once the player builds the necessary cards one could, another set of six is dealt: one on each of the four tableau piles and two face-down ones set aside on the reserve. Afterwards, the player builds more cards and the process is repeated until the stock runs out. Once this occurs, the entire reserve is turned face-up. All cards in that reserve become available to be built on the foundations, along with the top cards of each reserve pile.

When play goes on a stand still (when the tableau and the reserve no longer yields playable cards), the player is then entitled to three redeals. To do a redeal, the player picks up first tableau pile and places it over the second pile, picks up that newly formed pile and puts in over the third pile, and these three piles are then laid over the fourth pile. Then, the piles are turned face-down to form the new stock, and the remaining reserve piles are placed under it. On the first two redeals, the process of dealing one card on each of the four tableau piles and two more on the reserve faced down, stopping each time to make any play, and using the reserve when the stock runs out is repeated. But on the last redeal, there is no more reserve; all cards are dealt four at a time, one on each tableau pile.

The game ends soon after the stock runs out in the last redeal. The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.

Parisienne
Parisienne (also known as La Parisienne or Parisian) is a variant of Grand Duchess. The game is played like Grand Duchess except the before the game starts, one ace and one king of each suit is removed from the deck and placed on the foundations.

The islands are uninhabited except for a small permanent Honduran naval garrison stationed on Great Swan Island that maintains the Islas del Cisne Airport.

Geography

The Swan Islands lie within the exclusive economic zone of Honduras and belong to the Islas de la Bahía department of Honduras. They consist of three islands: 
 Great Swan Island (3 km long, 2 km2)
 Little Swan Island (2.4 km long, 0.5 km wide, 1.2 km2)
 Booby Cay (90 metres long, 70 m off the southwestern corner of Great Swan Island, <0.01 km2)

Rosario Bank and Misteriosa Bank are  north of the Swan Islands and separated from them by the > deep Cayman Trench.

History

The Swan Islands were discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1502 and named the Islas de las Pozas. In the 18th Century, they were renamed the Swan Islands, after Captain Swan, the captain of the Cygnet, whom pirates captured and forced to join them.

American entrepreneurs first started exporting guano as a fertilizer in the 1840s. The American-owned, New York-City-headquartered ""Atlantic and Pacific Guano Company"" was established in the 1840s and started exporting fertilizer, based on guano collected on the Swan Islands. In 1856, the United States apparently claimed the islands. In April 1857, John Valentine White claimed the islands, by virtue of the Guano Islands Act; later that year, he transferred all interest in these islands to Charles Sterns, Joseph W. Fabens, and Duff Green. Messers Sterns, Fabens, and Green incorporated the Atlantic and Pacific Guano Company, which issued 50,000 shares at a price of $100 each for a total capitalization of $5,000,000 in 1858. The company even issued currency, signed by William H. Whitfield, in 25-cent, 50-cent, and one-dollar denominations on June 1, 1867, to facilitate commerce on the islands.

Subsequently, a chemical company bought the islands but became insolvent. Captain Alonzo Adams sailed there in 1893 and took possession of the islands; in 1904, he assigned ownership to the Swan Island Commercial Company. That company leased part of Great Swan Island to the United Fruit Company, which grew coconut palms and set up a wireless radio relay station for servicing their Caribbean fleet but eventually abandoned the lease. The Swan Island Commercial Company provided hurricane monitoring data from 1928 to 1932. The U.S. Weather Bureau staffed a hurricane weather station on Great Swan from 1938 onward, but only during hurricane seasons.

During World War II, both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Weather Bureau stationed personnel on the island. In the late 1940s until 1949, Swan Island became a U.S. Department of Agriculture animal quarantine station for the importation of beef. In 1914, what now is the National Weather Service (NWS) and, later, the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) set up meteorological and communication assets on Swan to support aeronautical services and hurricane-prediction activities. The FAA departed Swan Island in the 1960s, leaving the NWS all assets and responsibilities.

Honduras claimed these islands from 1923, asserting that, because Columbus had discovered the islands while sailing for Spain, they should be owned by the nearest Spanish-speaking country. Both the United States and Honduras claimed the Swan Islands until the United States dropped its claim under the Guano Islands Act. A treaty was signed on November 22, 1971, and clear title by Honduras became effective September 1, 1972. The ownership of the island had long been in dispute. The Sumner Smith family has always maintained their ownership and, apparently, did have some standing in the U.S. courts. Nevertheless, the American government chose to abandon its claim despite this standing (ref. D S Platt, et al., NOAA-NWS). The islands gained notoriety in the early 1960s from the activities of Radio Swan, which began broadcasting in May 1960 during the preparation for and, later, the conduct of the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The station was removed from the islands in the late 1960s, its main transmitter then transferred for use in the Vietnam War.

In 1965, Bellaire, Texas, police questioned a former Bellaire High School student about his role in a teenage ""army"" dedicated to freeing ""oppressed countries,"" the Houston Chronicle reported. The group, called the Kononiers, had been in existence for about five years, the student told the newspaper, and was armed through a series of burglaries of the Deep River Armory store. The weapons were taken to the Addicks Reservoir area, where they trained for combat. The youths were training for ""Operation Liberation Swan Island"" off Honduras.

In 1987, the Los Angeles Times reported that the CIA and other American governmental agencies had a covert training facility on Swan Island for Nicaraguan Contras. In 1989, the president of Honduras, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, declared the island a protected wildlife refuge.

In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch moved through the area with winds of .

In 2001, Swan Island Development, LLC, of Brooksville, Florida, announced plans to develop the Swan Islands by 2010, in partnership with the government of Honduras. Luxury real estate and hotels, valued at five billion dollars, were envisioned, with a main city named Cygnet. In 2004, Swan Island Development also announced plans to establish a human stem-cell research center. , neither has occurred

She was a proponent of the rights of women and illegitimate children. As a journalist, Domínguez Navarro supported feminist views while writing for various media in Cuba, and in 1935, became the first woman newspaper director in the country with  La Palabra.

She was noted as one of the leading intellectuals of the decades of 1930 and 1940, with Mirta Aguirre and Mariblanca Sabas Aloma.

Biography
The daughter of Florentino Dominguez and Paula Navarro, she was born into a family with revolutionary ideals who were participant activists. Her mother passed away when she was just fourteen years old, and the care of her younger siblings fell on her. However, she was able to still graduate from high school. She graduated from university in 1918 with a Bachelor of Science, followed by a degree in Civil law from the University of Havana in 1921.

After graduating from law school, she began her long professional career in women’s work. She was a criminal defense lawyer and focused on defending prostitutes and other impoverished women. She belonged to the group of women and intellectuals who founded the Club Femenino de Cuba, of which she became a delegate to First National Congress of Women in Cuba in 1923. At the conference, she spoke passionately about the rights of illegitimate children and argued for the necessity of paternity testing. Dominguez also spoke in 1926 at the Panama Congress, where she encouraged the formation of a broader Pan-American feminist movement. She was also founder of the Alianza Nacional Feminista (National Feminist Alliance).

In 1924, Domínguez Navarro founded the magazine Villaclara and served as its director. Her articles were published in several other newspapers, such  La Prensa, El Mundo, El Cubano Libre and El País, in addition to writing for the feminist magazine, Bohemia y Carteles. In Mexico, she wrote in the Nacional and El Universal, among others.

Politically, Domínguez Navarro participated in the movement against the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado, for which she was imprisoned and exiled to Mexico. In 1936, along with Matilde Rodríguez Cabo, she first proposed reforms designed to decriminalize abortion in Mexico's Penal Code, a proposal that was at the forefront of the international debate looming on the self-determination of women.

Life
A native of Hartford, Connecticut, Giard majored in English literature and received a B.A. from Yale University in 1961, then an M.A. in Comparative Literature from Boston University in 1965. For a time he taught intermediate grades at the New Lincoln School. By 1972, he began to photograph, concentrating on landscapes of the South Fork of Long Island, portraits of friends, many of them artists and writers in the region, and the nude figure.
 
In 1974, Giard settled in Amagansett, Long Island, with his life partner, Jonathan Silin, an early childhood educator, where they remained for nearly thirty years until Giard's death. In the beginning years of his career, Giard did much of his landscape photography during the late autumn, winter, and early spring when many of the fashionable houses of the Hamptons were boarded up for the season.

Career
Ultimately, it would be in the area of the formal portrait that Giard¹s career made its most indelible mark. In 1985, after seeing a performance of Larry Kramer¹s The Normal Heart dealing with the crisis
of AIDS, Giard set about documenting in straightforward, unadorned, yet sometimes witty and playful portraits, a wide survey of significant gay and lesbian literary lights. His portraits included such iconic figures as Edward Albee, Allen Ginsberg, and Adrienne Rich, as well as emerging novelists making their first mark, including Sapphire, David Leavitt, Shay Youngblood, and Michael Cunningham. A selection of these portraits, culled from the five hundred examples he had by then already amassed, was published by MIT Press in 1997 as the anthology Particular Voices: Portraits of Gay and Lesbian Writers, which then served as the companion volume to the New York Public Library¹s 1998 exhibition of the same name.
 
At the time of his death in July, 2002, just shy of his 63rd birthday, Giard was working on a portrait documentation of the three hundred twenty-one grant recipients from around the country of the Thanks Be To Grandmother Winifred Foundation, which until 2001 supported projects by women fifty-four years and older that benefited other mature women. Grants supported research and artistic projects, as well
as efforts to alleviate social, economic, and medical problems for women in a given locality. Giard, traveling the country by train, bus, and plane (he never had a driver¹s license) succeeded in photographing two hundred forty-one of the women grantees, and kept a journal of his travels and his many visits to a richly diverse group of American women in small towns and major cities.

Robert Giard was the recipient of many grants and awards, and the published version of Particular Voices won a Lambda Literary Foundation Award for Best Photography/Art Book in 1997. Giard had a long and distinguished solo and group exhibition career throughout the United States. Examples of his work are in collections of Brooklyn Museum, San Francisco Public Library, New York Public Library, and the Library of Congress. Giard¹s complete archive, including work books and ephemera, is now housed in the American Collection of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University.

Legacy
The Robert Giard Foundation was formed in 2002 with the aim of preserving his photographic legacy, promoting his work for educational purposes, and encouraging the work of young photographers.   The annual Robert Giard Fellowship is a $7,500 grant to visual artists whose work addresses sexuality, gender, and issues of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender identity.

239,14950054,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max%20von%20Gagern,Max von Gagern,"Max von Gagern (b. Weilburg (in Nassau), Germany, 25 March 1810; died Vienna, 17 October 1889) was a German liberal politician.

Early life
He was the son of Hans Christoph von Gagern, minister of state in Nassau; he attended the gymnasiums at Kreuznach, Mannheim, and Weilburg, and studied law from 1826 at Heidelberg, Utrecht, and Göttingen. After a stay in Paris he received in 1829 a position in the cabinet of William I, King of the Netherlands. At the outbreak of the Belgian Revolution (1830) he joined the Dutch army as a volunteer and took part in the war against Belgium.  In 1833 he retired from the service of the Netherlands, married Franzina Lambert, of The Hague, and took up historical studies in order to fit himself for the position of Privatdozent at Bonn University. He was at Bonn during the years 1837-40. In 1837, although still a Protestant, he sided with the imprisoned Archbishop of Cologne, Droste-Vischering, and thus lost the favour of the Prussian Government. In 1840 he was appointed ministerial successor with the title of Legationsrat by the Duke of Nassau.

On 28 August 1843, he joined the Roman Catholic Church.  Although naturally very religious he had grown indifferent to religion during his student life and his residence in the Netherlands. Acquaintance with Catholics and with the historian George Frederick Böhmer, who was friendly to Catholicism, awakened in him respect and veneration for the Church. The chief sources of his Catholic knowledge were, as he himself says, the Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, the study of Johann Möhler's Symbolik, and the New Testament. His conversion did not affect the favour of the Duke of Nassau who appointed him in 1844 extraordinary envoy to the Courts of the Netherlands and Belgium.

1848 Revolution
Gagern's labours during the revolutionary year of 1848 extended far beyond his native state. He was the centre of the efforts that aimed to mediate between the Government and the people and to reorganize the German Confederation as a nation. According to the schemes Prussia was to have the supreme direction of German affairs. With this end in view Gagern negotiated with the Governments of Southern Germany and with Prussia. He then took part in the debates of the preliminary parliament in Frankfurt, and at the same time was one of the seventeen confidential agents of the governments who were to aid the parliament of the Confederation in revising the constitution.

He was chosen president of this committee of seventeen, but was not as prominent at the Frankfurt Parliament as his brother Heinrich whom he supported. He joined the Catholic Club. On 5 August 1848, he was made under-secretary for foreign affairs in the imperial ministry which Archduke Johann, as administrator of the empire, had temporarily formed. In the question as to the constitution of Germany he worked with his brother for ""little Germany"" (exclusion of Austria from Germany, union of Germany under a Prussian empire). When the King of Prussia declined the imperial crown offered to him and the Parliament of Frankfurt approached dissolution, Von Gagern and his party withdrew from the assembly.

Later life
In 1850 Gagern was again in the service of the State of Nassau, being employed as an upper ministerial clerk. He had, however, lost the confidence of the duke by his ""Little Germany"" policy, and influential circles looked upon the Catholic Church unfavourably. In 1854, after having been conspicuously slighted, he retired from the state service. His efforts to obtain a historical professorship at Bonn failed, allegedly owing to the dislike of Protestants for converts to Catholicism. During the years 1855-73 he was in the service of Austria, first as head clerk in a ministerial department, then as departmental head in the mercantile political division of the ministry of foreign affairs. From 1860 he had also charge of the department of the press for foreign affairs, a position which gave him a deep insight into Austrian policy without, however, leading to an independent position. In 1881, eight years after his retirement on a pension, Emperor Franz Joseph I made him a life member of the upper house of the imperial Austrian Parliament.

History

Lone Star Cavalry
The Lone Star Cavalry were granted an expansion franchise in the America West Hockey League in March 2003. They stayed in the league when it merged with the North American Hockey League for the 2003–04 season. The Cavalry played out of the Blue Line Ice Complex in North Richland Hills, Texas and served the immediate ""Mid-Cities"" area of Metro Dallas-Fort Worth. The Cavalry were part of the NAHL's new South Division along with the Central Texas Blackhawks, Fairbanks Ice Dogs, Springfield (MO) Spirit, Texas Tornado, Texarkana Bandits, and Wichita Falls Rustlers.

Santa Fe RoadRunners
After financial difficulties caused the Cavalry's home rink, the Blue Line Ice Complex, to close, the Cavalry were left without a home. Due to this and other factors, the Cavalry ended up being sold and relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The team was granted membership on September 20, 2004, and began play on September 25, 2004, under their new identity as the Santa Fe RoadRunners. The Santa Fe RoadRunners played out of the Genoveva Chavez Community Center in Santa Fe. In their inaugural season in New Mexico, the RoadRunners played in the South Division, against the Central Texas Marshals, Springfield (IL) Jr. Blues, Springfield Spirit, Texarkana Bandits, Texas Tornado, and the Wichita Falls Wildcats, finishing with a 33–15–8 record, good for 3rd place in the division. The following season they finished dead last in the South Division behind the Tornado, Bandits, Jr. Blues, and the Wildcats. The third and final season in Santa Fe saw the RoadRunners finishing with a 41–17–4 record for second place in a South Division that consisted of the St. Louis Bandits, Texas Tornado, Fairbanks Ice Dogs, Wichita Falls Wildcats, and the Alaska Avalanche.

Topeka RoadRunners

On February 26, 2007, the team announced their move to Topeka, Kansas, from Santa Fe, New Mexico, due to claims of poor attendance. Santa Fe ranked 17th out of 18 teams in attendance.

The move to Topeka was initiated by a grass roots effort, led by hockey fans from Topeka. In their first season in Topeka, 2007–08, they were third in league attendance while playing in Landon Arena. That season the team won the NAHL South Division and South Division Playoffs. They finished in third place at the Robertson Cup competition. The 2008–09 season saw the RoadRunners finishing fourth in league attendance and 2nd in the South Division. The team lost in the second round of the South Division playoffs. In 2009–10 The RoadRunners finished first in the South Division, and they were second in attendance. The 2010–11 season saw the RoadRunners claim the NAHL President's Cup as the league's regular season champions.

On January 7, 2016, the RoadRunners fired long-tenured head coach and general manager Scott Langer, who had been with the team since their days as the Cavalry and the head coach since their first season in Santa Fe. He was hired immediately after the season ended by the Aberdeen Wings. Former RoadRunner player and assistant coach Josh Kamrass was hired as his replacement. On November 24, 2017, assistant coach Justin DeMartino took over as an interim head coach, so that Kamrass could spend more time at home and took a front office job with the organization overseeing all the ownership's teams including their Tier III teams.

Topeka Pilots

On April 18, 2018, owners of the franchise since 2009, Barbara & Donald Stone, sold the franchise to Loretto Sports Ventures, a company owned by Lamar Hunt Jr., that also operates the Kansas City Mavericks in the ECHL. In the same press conference, Hunt announced the new head coach and general manager as Simon Watson for the 2018–19 season. The new ownership also announced the team would be rebranded and was renamed the Topeka Pilots on June 5, 2018.

Amarillo Wranglers
On February 28, 2020, Lamar Hunt Jr. announced he was moving the team to the Kansas City metropolitan area for the 2020–21 season. The team was renamed after the former NHL team, the Kansas City Scouts, and were to play at least the 2020–21 season at the Kansas City Ice Center in the suburb of Shawnee, Kansas. However, the team instead went dormant for the 2020–21 season due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic with plans to return for the 2021–22 season. The Scouts also received dormancy status for the 2021–22 season on March 4, 2021, however, the team would never play a game as the Scouts.

On May 21, 2021, the NAHL announced Hunt had instead sold the team to Amarillo Ice Sports, LLC, a locally owned and operated group including Chris Wright, Roger Wright, and Amarillo hockey alumni Eric Andersen, and Austin Sutter. The new team was named after the original Amarillo Wranglers.  The Wranglers re-entered the league for the 2021–22 season, replacing the recently relocated Amarillo Bulls in the Amarillo Civic Center, with Harry Mahood as general manager and head coach. The Wranglers then hired Karlis Zirnis as director of player personnel.

246,20994920,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mynydd%20Epynt,Mynydd Epynt,"Mynydd Epynt () is a former community and upland area in Powys, Wales.

The Ministry of Defence controversially evicted the community of Mynydd Epynt in 1940, creating what is now the core of the Sennybridge Training Area (SENTA), the largest military training zone in Wales.

Etymology 
The name of the area is often given as Mynydd Eppynt or Eppynt in historical sources and it appears under this spelling in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.

Mynydd is the Welsh word for mountain or upland area but the meaning of Epynt is less certain. The most commonly stated etymology is ""a pathway for horses"", deriving from the P-Celtic root epos, meaning ""horse"" (as in ebol, meaning ""a foal"" in Modern Welsh). However, Thomas Morgan suggested the name may be interpreted as a place where ""the way (referring to the ancient mountain trackway) rises abruptly"", deriving from eb- (""an issuing out"") and -hynt (""a way"" or ""course""). A ridge continuing south-west from Mynydd Epynt is known as Mynydd Bwlch-y-groes, which may be translated as ""mountain at the cross-road pass"" or else ""mountain at the pass of the cross"". 

These etymologies all suggest that the area was known since ancient times as a place where important upland routes intersected, routes still largely extant in the modern era as drovers' roads.

History

Prehistory 

The area attracted antiquarian interest from as early as 1809, when Theophilus Jones described a number of enclosures, cairns and stone circles. Modern archaeologists have surveyed the sites at Ynys Hir, Cornelau Uchaf and Twyn y Post, including what has since been described as a ""Prehistoric Monument Complex"".

Many of the features on Mynydd Epynt are known to be Bronze Age in origin, but the diversity of these monuments suggest they did not share a common purpose and that there was numerous phases of construction, in different historical eras. Some of the older monuments form part of later construction areas. These older sites were either reincorporated or left undisturbed, demonstrating a continued understanding of their importance and a respect for the beliefs of previous generations and cultures. The monuments are located near the trackways that cross Mynydd Epynt, and many are positioned at crossroads.

Later history 

The modern community of Mynydd Epynt was active from at least the Medieval period, with archaeological surveys detailing preserved field systems, undisturbed by modern farming methods.

The importance of the area's trackways is evidenced by the four ""droving inns"" that were established on the northern side of Mynydd Epynt (The Griffin Inn, Tafarn y Mynydd, Spite Inn and The Drover's Arms). Following the Ministry of Defence's acquisition in 1940, the Drover's Arms became an important landmark within the Sennybridge Training Area (SENTA). The inn's exterior was restored in the 1990s despite its continued use in active military training.

The inns were part of an active Welsh-speaking community, with a school, church, and numerous chapels holding regular cultural events such as Eisteddfodau and Gymanfa Ganu. A noted custom of the community, was to lay out a white sheet whenever a family was in need of help, this would act as a signal to the rest of the community, who would make their way to the house and offer their assistance.

Military Acquisition 
The Ministry of Defence listed a number of properties in the area for a potential acquisition as early as the First World War. The people of Mynydd Epynt remained unaware of these plans until September 1939 when an army officer, struggling with Welsh orthography had asked children at the local school to identify and locate fifty two homes. By December, each of these households had received a notice to vacate their property before the end of April. The letter stressed the importance of the area to the war effort and that they would be compensated for their losses.

A number of Welsh MPs and leading figures spoke out against the acquisition. However, this opposition was largely dismissed at the time as against the war effort or part of a wider anti-British sentiment. As the evictions took place during the lambing season, some farmers were granted a short extension, but all of the evictions had been completed by June 1940. In total, four hundred people were ejected, with the army seizing an area of 30,000 acres. The area now forms the core of the Sennybridge Training Area (SENTA), one of the largest military training zones in the UK.

Impact of the evictions 
The evictions, known as Yr Chwalfa (the clearing) in Welsh, have been described as ""The death blow to Welsh-speaking Breconshire."" by Euros Lewis. Lewis drew comparisons with the end of the community to that of Capel Celyn, noting the comparatively young death rate of the evicted, and the belief that one resident had ""cried himself to death"". As the evicted were dispersed into more English speaking areas, the evictions had a significant impact on ""Y Fro Gymraeg"" (Welsh speaking Wales), reducing both its area in eastern Wales and the number of dialects spoken. The historic trackways over Mynydd Epynt had long been protected as public rights of way, but all routes through the training area were closed as a result of the acquisition.

Later accounts suggest that many of the evicted believed they would return at the end of the Second World War, with accounts of people leaving their keys in locks, returning to keep the homes in a habitable condition and even continuing to plough the fields. The military had difficulty keeping some former residents away. Thomas Morgan, returned to his ""Glandŵr"" house daily to light a fire in the hearth (protecting the stonework). Morgan was repeatedly warned to stop returning, but continued until his home was destroyed by explosives, with a military officer informing him that ""We’ve blown up the farmhouse. You won’t need to come here anymore"".

The evictions, were documented by Iorwerth Peate, the curator and founder of the Saint Fagan Folk Museum. Peate made several visits to the area, including the last day of evictions. Peate evocatively described meeting one of those evicted, at her ""Waunlwyd"" home. The elderly woman sat motionless and tearful with her back to her house (Peate later discovered that the woman was eighty two years old and had been born at the property, as had her father and grandfather). Wary of the solemnity of the occasion and believing he had not been noticed, Peate tried to back away when the woman suddenly asked him where he was from. Peate answered ‘Caerdydd’ (Cardiff in Welsh), to which she replied: ""Fy machgen bach i, ewch yn ôl yno gynted ag y medrwch"", (Little one, return there as soon as you can,) ""Mae’n ddiwedd byd yma"" (it is the end of the world here). The Welsh phrase, Mae’n ddiwedd byd yma has become associated with the evictions and is the title of the Welsh language history of Mynydd Epynt published in 1997.

Expansion and developments 

Training operations had destroyed most of the original structures which had formed the community of Mynydd Epynt, including chapels and their cemeteries. Despite this, the area saw the construction of an artificial village in 1988. The Fighting In Built Up Areas zone (FIBUA) saw the construction of many mock buildings, including a fake chapel with imitation gravestones.

Since the 1990s, the army have expanded the SENTA area and most of Mynydd Epynt is now subject to restricted access owing to the use of live ammunition and explosives. Although explosives have destroyed the agricultural land, sheep grazing continues within the area under communal grazing and letting licences.

One of the homes acquired in 1940, ""Disgwylfa"", was refurbished in the 1990s as a conservation centre. The property was again refurbished and re-opened in 2009 as 'Canolfan Epynt' (the 'Epynt Centre').

Despite the closure of the ancient trackways over Mynydd Epynt, SENTAs outlying areas continued to be Open Country or open access land. In 2004, The MOD created a long-distance path around the perimeter of the range. The Epynt Way is a circular route designed for walkers, horse riders and mountain-bikers.

The area was chosen as a special stage in the Wales Rally GB from 2006 to 2008.

Geography

The area of Mynydd Epynt is bounded to the south by the upper stretch of the Usk Valley and the Brecon Beacons National Park, to the north by the Irfon valley, and to the east by the valley of the River Wye. Its western boundary is less distinct but lies eastward of the A483 Llandovery to Llanwrtyd Wells road. 

The area is an extensive plateau lying between 400 and 450m, drained by several southward-flowing rivers which empty into the River Usk, these include (from west to east) the Cilieni, Nant Bran, Afon Ysgir (with its two headwaters the Ysgir Fechan and Ysgir Fawr) and Afon Honddu. The Duhonw drains north-eastward into the River Wye. The highest point is a Marilyn (having topographic prominence of at least 150m) of 478m.

Geology 
Mynydd Epynt is largely formed from the Raglan Mudstone Formation and the St Maughans Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the latest part of the Silurian period and the succeeding Devonian period though there is little in the way of rock exposures at the surface. The northern and western escarpment of Mynydd Epynt is formed from a suite of rocks assigned to the Ludlow stage of the late Silurian and which include the Temeside Mudstone, the Tilestones, the Cae'r Mynach, Fibua, Aberedw, Cwm Craig Ddu and Irfon Formations. These consist variously of sandstones, mudstones and siltstones.

There is a broken spread of glacial till across the area resulting from its inundation by ice from the mid Wales ice sheet to the north during the ice ages and hill peat has accumulated in some areas in post-glacial times.

Welsh TT motorcycle races

From 1948 to 1953 the area was used for yearly motorcycle road racing. Announced at the Motorcycle Live show in late 2017, a new organisation – Welsh Road Race – proposed to once again organise road racing, based on a repeal of certain clauses within the UK Road Traffic Act regulations, which previously banned racing on public roads in the UK. The Secretary of State for Defence granted the organisers a licence to again use a  circuit based on a network of private tarmacced roads contained within the Crown Estate, as was previously used to stage the historic Eppynt Motor Cycle Road Races. 

Due to unforeseen circumstances, the anticipated return of road racing to this area in August 2018 was cancelled in early February 2018 due to difficulties with the Welsh Road Traffic regulations and time-frame considered as too-short for the ACU-sanctioned event, and it was postponed until 2019. Unlike the Isle of Man TT races which are free to attend, the organisers had already started to sell admission tickets via their website for the multi-category event based on a long-weekend.

The organisers include racer Jenny Tinmouth and former racer  and TT rider Steve Plater who also acts as a consultant development rider to Norton Motorcycles for their new V4 RR machine.

In popular culture 
Musician Gruff Rhys has a song called 'Epynt' after the mountain, which features on his first solo album Yr Atal Genhedlaeth. Also the song context is about money, with the 'E' standing for the Euro, and 'pynt' sounding similar to the Welsh word for Pound.

The CL125A was produced from 1967 to 1969 with a 124 cc 4-stroke engine and four-speed transmission.  It was the smallest OHC twin cylinder four-stroke that Honda made, and was the smaller sibling to the 160, 175, 350 & 450 models.

In 1970, Honda released its venerable, light weight, 99 cc OHC single 2-valve upright engine. This was a direct challenge to the off-road market which was, at this time, dominated by the two-strokes. A sea wave of change was to quickly follow many of its CB, CL and SL based models.

In 1973, the first CL125S was manufactured using this new motor in its design, with a larger 122 cc piston (which produced more low-end torque but little gain in power) and a slightly larger piston/rod connecting pin. That helped push the dry weight of the bike down to . This motorcycle was almost identical to the 1970 to 1973 CL100, that was really only a slight modification of the CB series produced at the same time. The modifications included; lower rear sprocket gearing, slightly more aggressive tires, shorter front fender, braced handlebar, high mount exhaust system and elimination of the tachometer.

Economy 
Traditionally, the main occupation of the people of Kakching has been the farming of crops, but greater opportunities have arisen in the last five years, including carpentry, goldsmithing, sales, construction work, as well as the raising of livestock. Additionally, the state and central governments finance self-help groups (SHGs).

Kakching is known as the granary of Manipur. Its workers produce the highest percentage of food grains in the state. The availability of proper irrigation and canal facilities has allowed farmers to practice double cropping. Rice, pulses, cereal and potatoes are the important production of this sub-division. Hand-loom and handicraft products are also made in high volume for the Kakching market.

Education 
Kakching has the highest literacy rate in the state of Manipur. Colleges include Manipur University - Kha-Manipur College, Kakching (Government), and Kakching Girls College (Private). There are many higher secondary schools, high schools, and several middle and primary schools. There are many private schools in and around Kakching, including Padma Ratna English School, Martin Grammar School, Victory High School, Kakching Public School and Grace Cottage Academy.

Due to the law and order problem in the state, after class X and class XII, many students go outside the state for studies. Kakching is an important town for higher studies in Indian classical music under the Bhatkhande Hindusthani Sangeet Mahavidyalay, the only institution in Eastern India where Indian classical music is taught up to the highest levels (Nipun), attracting hundreds of students every year from Manipur.

Culture and Tourism

Kakching participates in many cultural fields reflecting the heritage of the Meitei people, including storytelling and dance (Nat Sankirtan and Meitei Pung Cholom), as well as the martial arts Thang-Ta, Satjal, Mukna, and the sport of Kangjei. The Kakching Haraoba festival is one of six Lai Haraoba in the state of Manipur. This festival is in part a recollection of the creation stories played by the deities with the first origin of this universe and evolution of plants and animals through the will of Atiya Shidaba.

The People's Museum in Kakching houses many ethnic and valuable items. Additionally, the municipality has three cinema halls that provide daily shows.

The dialect of Meitei language spoken in Kakching is slightly different from the main Meitei language in terms of tone and style.

Markets, including those run by the local company ADAM Kakching, where wood products and gift-items are sold, have attracted people from outside the town.

Another popular attraction in the town is Uyok Ching - Kakching Garden.

Aerodrome
During the Second World War and as part of campaigns against the Indian National Army and its allies, the British Government in India constructed an aerodrome in Kakching which provided the British Army with vital arms, ammunition and food. Today the site is occupied mostly by the Assam Rifles and partially converted into paddy fields by local farmers. There are still hangar sites in and around the small hills surrounding the aerodrome. Farmers have been known to find shells while tilling the land.

Indian national hero, Subhas Chandra Bose, took his last flight from the aerodrome after the war before his controversial death.

Kakching Garden 

Kakching Garden is situated at Uyok Ching, to the south of Kakching Bazar, and has been developed as a tourist centre. The site includes the Mahadev Temple, Ibudhou Pakhang Laiseng, the statue of Hao Sampubi, a rose garden, park and restaurants. A road up to the hill was constructed for vehicles to reach the garden.

The site is popular with people from Manipur and the surrounding area. Important programmes relating to social and culture are also organised here.

Politics
Kakching is part of Outer Manipur (Lok Sabha constituency). It sends one MLA in the state assembly. Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwor Singh represents Kakching following the 11th assembly election.

The film was made immediately prior to Carpenter's theatrical hit Halloween; it was produced by Warner Bros. and aired on NBC on November 29, 1978.

Plot
Leigh Michaels relocates from New York City to Los Angeles, where she lands a job directing live television for a local station. Leigh rents a spacious apartment in a downtown high-rise building. She quickly befriends Sophie, a lesbian co-director with whom she will be working, and is aggressively pursued by Steve, a male director. During her first day on the job, Leigh receives an anonymous phone call from an unknown man. When she returns to her apartment, she finds the door unlocked, and presumes it was a worker who forgot to lock it after performing maintenance. Unbeknownst to Leigh, the man who phoned her at work—a stalker residing in a building across from hers—has infiltrated the apartment, and placed recording devices inside to monitor her.

One day, Leigh receives a letter from a company called ""Excursions Unlimited,"" which informs her she has won a free vacation to Europe. At a bar, Leigh meets Paul Winkless, a philosophy professor at the University of Southern California, whom she finds herself attracted to. She subsequently begins receiving gifts in the mail, including a telescope and a swimsuit mailed to her anonymously. 

Leigh begins to grow frightened as the anonymous calls continue, as well as unusual phenomenon in her apartment, such as her lights dimming of their own accord. One night, she finds a letter slid under her door from someone claiming to be from Excursions Unlimited, there to discuss her vacation reward. Leigh is skeptical of the claim, and suspects the anonymous caller and other odd phenomenon is related to the purported ""free vacation"" notice. Armed with a knife, Leigh attempts to trail the person who left the letter, and ventures into the basement laundry room. Leigh accidentally drops the knife into a large floor drain; she removes the grate to retrieve the knife, and proceeds to hide beneath it when she hears someone walking down the hall. She watches from below as a man stands over the grate. When he leaves, Leigh crawls out of the drain, and flees back to her apartment.

In a subsequent phone call, the stalker comments on Leigh's appearance, leading her to realize the man resides in the building across from hers. She, Sophie, and Paul stake out in Leigh's apartment and attempt to identify the stalker by using the telescope to view the opposite apartments. A meeting with Gary Hunt, a police officer, is unfruitful as he informs Leigh that the man has not committed a crime. Back at Leigh's apartment, the stalker phones again, asking Leigh to look out the telescope; she sees the man she witnessed in the laundry room, apparently looking back at her through his telescope. Police subsequently arrest the man for harassment, though he denies any involvement, and he leaves California to return to his native Iowa.

Leigh is horrified when she receives another letter, and spots a different man spying on her from his balcony—she realizes the wrong man was caught. Armed with a walkie-talkie and a knife, Leigh goes to confront her stalker, communicating with Sophie, who watches from Leigh's apartment. When Leigh manages to enter the stalker's apartment, she witnesses Sophie being attacked in hers. She rushes back, but finds Sophie has vanished. Police find that Sophie had a flight to Fort Worth that night, and assume she left Los Angeles; they also explain to Leigh that the apartment she believes her stalker resides in is temporarily empty, as the resident is working abroad.

Alone in her apartment again, Leigh discovers a hidden microphone the stalker has used to surveil her. Through further investigation, Leigh and Paul learn the name of the apartment building's inspector, Herbert Stiles, a prominent inspector who has access to numerous buildings in the city. Suspecting Stiles may be the stalker, Leigh discovers his address and breaks into his house. There, she finds a number of microphones and other devices suggesting he has been the one bugging her apartment. After phoning Paul, Leigh returns to her apartment, but finds the lights out. On the coffee table is a typewritten suicide note signed with Leigh's name. In the dark, Leigh is suddenly attacked by Stiles, who attempts to throw her over the balcony, but she manages to stab him with a shard of glass before he falls over to his death.

Cast

Production

Development
Among fans, Someones Watching Me! is often referred to as ""the lost Carpenter film"" due to its scarce availability on home video for many years.

It had the working title High Rise. Carpenter was hired by Warner Bros. in 1976 to write a feature script based on a true story about a woman in Chicago.  He spent three months writing it and handed it in. Eight months later Warners contacted him saying they wanted to do it as a TV movie and offered Carpenter a chance to direct it.

""I thought it was a really, really good idea,"" said Carpenter. ""So I had my first experience with television. And my first union experience. I got into the Director's Guild through that. I had a real good time on it, I have to tell you. I met my wife [Adrienne Barbeau].""

Shooting
The film was shot in eighteen days. ""I had some control over it,"" said Carpenter. ""I was able to shoot only what I wanted, I wouldn't cover it... I just gave them what I wanted and it got okayed.""

Carpenter worked with Adrienne Barbeau, whom he married in 1979, for the first time when making Someones Watching Me!. Barbeau later starred in The Fog (1980) and had a supporting role in Escape from New York (1981).

The television station Leigh Michaels gets a job at is named KJHC. The last three letters are a secret wink to the writer and director's full name: John Howard Carpenter.

Filming finished by April 1978. ""I think it's the best thing I've done,"" said Hutton.

Carpenter says that two weeks later he started filming Halloween and many of the techniques in Halloween he devised on Someone's Watching Me. Carpenter later said he was ""very proud"" of the film even though it was not one of his better known works.

Reception
NBC promoted Someones Watching Me! as a ""Tales of the Unexpected special,"" as to imply that the film was related to the 1977 NBC television series Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected, but Quinn Martin Productions played no role in the making of the film, which was unrelated to the series.

Awards
Carpenter was nominated for the 1979 Edgar Award of Best Television Feature or Miniseries for the film.

Home Media

Scream Factory released the film on Blu Ray on August 7, 2018.

255,1580801,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials%20of%20Mana,Trials of Mana,"Trials of Mana, also known by its Japanese title  is a 1995 action role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Famicom. It is the sequel to the 1993 game Secret of Mana, and is the third installment in the Mana series. Set in a high fantasy world, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to claim the legendary Mana Sword and prevent the Benevodons from being unleashed and destroying the world. It features three lengthy main plotlines and six different possible main characters, each with their own storylines, and allows two players to play simultaneously. Trials of Mana builds on the gameplay of its predecessor with multiple enhancements, including the use of a time progression system with transitions from day to night and weekday to weekday in game time, and a wide range of character classes to choose from, which provides each character with an exclusive set of skills and status progression.

The game was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka, and produced by Tetsuhisa Tsuruzono. Artwork was produced by manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki, while the music was composed by Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players had been able to play Seiken Densetsu 3 due to an unofficial English fan translation released in 1999. Seiken Densetsu 3 received considerable acclaim from reviewers, who praised the graphics as among the best ever made for the Super Famicom and the gameplay as an improved version of its predecessor's. The plot received mixed reviews by critics, who found the overlapping stories to be interesting and to enhance replayability, but the characters and plotlines themselves to be flat and clichéd. Overall, the game is considered by some critics to be a Super Famicom classic.

In June 2017, the game was included in the Seiken Densetsu Collection release for the Nintendo Switch in Japan; the collection was released in June 2019 in North America and the PAL region as Collection of Mana with Seiken Densetsu 3 titled Trials of Mana. A 3D remake of the same name was announced alongside it, and released worldwide in April 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

Gameplay

Trials of Mana has similar gameplay to its predecessor, Secret of Mana. Like many other role-playing games of the 16-bit era, the game displays a top-down perspective, in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Control may be passed between each of the characters at any time; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by two players, as opposed to the three of Secret of Mana. There are six possible player characters. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which three of them will be playable and which one they will start with; the other two playable characters will join the party when met. The remaining three characters act as non-playable characters (NPCs) when encountered.

Each character can use one type of weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell in relation to the enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character can increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.

Character level progression is coordinated by the player, as a choice is given as to which statistic to raise by a point at every level up. A ""class"" system is also present. Once a character reaches level 18, the player can visit one of several Mana Stones located throughout the game and choose to upgrade them to one of two classes for each character—either a class aligned to ""Light"" or a class aligned to ""Dark""—which provides a different set of skills and different improvements to character statistics. A second class change may be optionally performed at level 38, again split between a light and a dark choice, if the player has obtained a required rare item for the target class. The class changes do not affect the plot of the game, only gameplay.

Trials of Mana also employs a calendar function into its gameplay. A week cycles much more quickly than an actual one, with a day passing in a matter of minutes. Each day of the week is represented by a different elemental spirit. On that spirit's day, magic of that element will be slightly stronger. An in-game day is also divided into day and night. Certain events only happen during certain times of day, such as a nighttime-only black market selling particularly rare items. Enemies encountered in the field also change during certain time periods, and some may be sleeping if the characters approach them at night. In addition, the character Kevin transforms into a werewolf when he fights at night, greatly increasing his attack power. Using an inn's services allows the player to ""skip"" the game's clock to that day's evening, or the following morning.

Story

Setting
The story takes place in a fictional world where Mana represents an ethereal, but finite, energy source. Some time in the past, the Mana Goddess created the game's world by forging the powerful Sword of Mana and defeating eight monsters of destruction, the Benevodons—""God Beasts"" in earlier translations—with it, sealing them within eight Mana Stones, before turning herself into the Mana Tree and falling asleep. The game is set at a time when Mana starts to fade and peace has ended, as several people plot to unleash the Benevodons from the stones so as to gain ultimate power. The game is not a direct sequel to the events in Secret of Mana; according to series creator Koichi Ishii in 2006, the Mana games do not take place in exactly the same world, and characters or elements that appear in different games are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are more abstract than story-based. Despite this statement, the 2007 game Heroes of Mana is a direct prequel to Trials of Mana, taking place 19 years before the latter's story.

Characters
The characters (and their individual stories) are grouped into three main sub-plots. Duran and Angela oppose the Crimson Wizard and the Dragon Lord, Hawkeye and Riesz oppose Belladonna and the Dark Majesty, Kevin and Charlotte oppose Goremand and the Masked Mage. The main storyline is determined by the first character chosen, though there is significantly more character interaction and dialogue if the other member of the pair is also in the party.
 is an orphaned mercenary swordsman of Valsena, Kingdom of the Plains. His father, Loki the Golden Knight, was lost in battle with the Dragon Emperor, and his mother passed away of sickness soon after. One night, Duran is on guard duty at the castle of Valsena when the Crimson Wizard attacks the castle and murders several soldiers. Duran confronts him, only to be defeated easily and left for dead. After recovering, he vows to become the best swordsman in the world and to exact his revenge upon the Crimson Wizard.
 is the princess of the ice-covered Magic Kingdom of Altena, though she herself has little to no potential in magic unlike everyone else in the kingdom. Her mother, Queen Valda uses her magic to keep the citadel in Altena in a perpetual Spring, but the spell weakens as Mana starts to fade. To power the spell, she and her assistant the Crimson Wizard decide to invade other nations to claim their Mana Stones, though the spell to use the Stone is fatal to the caster. When the Queen tries to force Angela to use it after deeming her useless for her lack of magic, she flees from Altena and strives to become a powerful mage so that her mother would accept her again.
 is the half-human prince of Ferolia. His father, Gauser the Beast King, is sick of the treatment of his people by ""normal"" humans. His desired revenge is made possible by the appearance of Goremand, who shows the king his abilities by forcing Kevin to awaken his werewolf abilities by killing Kevin's best friend. When Kevin confronts the Beast King on this act and the King's plans to invade the human Holy City Wendel, Kevin is thrown out of the kingdom and swears revenge. He also seeks to find a way to bring Karl back to life and learn the fate of his human mother.
 is the half-elf granddaughter of the Priest of Light in Wendel. An orphan, she is looked after by a fellow cleric, Heath. Feeling an evil influence in nearby Jadd, the Priest of Light sends Heath to investigate, but Charlotte follows to witness Goremand abduct Heath, so she decides to go out on a journey to save him.
 is a member of a guild of noble thieves based in the desert Sand Fortress of Nevarl. The guild's leader, Lord Flamekhan, suddenly and uncharacteristically declares Nevarl to be a kingdom. Hawkeye decides to confront Flamekhan about it, only to discover he is being controlled by the witch Isabella. Isabella kills Eagle, Flamekhan's son and Hawkeye's friend, framing Hawkeye for his death and forcing him to flee.
 is the princess of the mountainous Wind Kingdom of Laurent and captain of its Amazon army. Two mysterious ninjas from Nevarl trick her younger brother Elliott into turning off Laurent's protective winds and kidnap him. With the winds gone, Nevarl attacks Laurent with a cloud of sleep powder and kills its king. Devastated, Riesz makes her escape and seeks out to find her lost brother.

Plot
The story begins in a different place for each playable character. With the exception of Charlotte, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character—now including Charlotte—on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Sanctuary of Mana, exhausted by her journey. Out of desperation, the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host, and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the Benevodons will reawaken and destroy the world. He goes on to explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. They can then restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not have the strength to do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined.

After journeying across the world to get the spirits, meeting the other two members of the party, thwarting the invasion attempts of Nevarl and Altena, discovering the powers of the Fire and Water Mana Stones, and learning the disappearance of the Mana Stone of Darkness along the way, the main character tries to open the gate to the Sanctuary of Mana with the spirits' assistance. The first attempt fails, but the second succeeds; the Faerie realizes that it was opened because someone else released the power from all the Mana Stones. The characters travel into the Sanctuary and the main character claims the Mana Sword. It is then discovered that the main character's adversaries—the Crimson Wizard and the Darkshine Knight for Angela and Duran; Malocchio and Isabella for Riesz and Hawkeye; or Goremand and a mind-controlled Heath, for Kevin and Charlotte—have defeated the other two sets of primary enemies. The remaining adversaries capture the Faerie and will only release her in exchange for the Mana Sword. The trade is made, and once the enemy receives the Sword, the Mana Stones shatter and the Benevodons are released.

The characters must then defeat the Benevodons before they can gather and destroy the world. However, after doing this they realize killing the Benevodons has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Lord for Duran and Angela, the Dark Majesty for Hawkeye and Riesz, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Charlotte. The already powerful villain absorbs the power of the Sword of Mana and the Benevodons in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.

Development

Seiken Densetsu 3 was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii. The game was directed by Hiromichi Tanaka and produced by Tetsuhisa Tsuruzono. Tanaka had previously worked on several titles for Square, including as a designer on the first three Final Fantasy titles. Manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki was responsible for the character concept artwork, based on designs by Ishii. Production began in 1993, beginning with a lengthy period of trial-and-error where several prototype designs were created and scrapped. As the next generation of console hardware was close to release, the team were unable to ""prolong"" production or keep its existence quiet as they had done with Secret of Mana. The team also had difficulties keeping staff, as many were being brought into the teams of other Super Famicom titles such as Chrono Trigger and Romancing SaGa 3 to get them finished. Programmers in particular were in demand, and Tanaka remembered ""fighting"" with Hironobu Sakaguchi for staff. A downloadable demo saw a limited release on July 1, 1995 for the Super Famicom's Satellaview broadcast peripheral.

The original intent was for a ""continuation"" of Secret of Mana, but the team ultimately scrapped all they had produced for the previous game and built Trials of Mana from scratch to become a more action-oriented title. The team wanted to get as close as possible to 3D graphics, with the design and background teams working in tandem to create multiple graphical layers. Some cut content from Secret of Mana, particularly monster designs, was reused for Trials of Mana. The final product was very large, with the team pushing the Super Famicom cartridge to capacity. A part cut from Trials of Mana before release was the end boss in the volcano dungeon; while planned from the outset, the team were short on time and so had to drop it.

The theme of the game is ""independence"". Ishii explained this as meaning he wanted the characters to have a sense of camaraderie through sharing each other's problems. The story kept a light tone, mostly due to Tanaka's insistence and Yūki's artwork. Each character was designed around both gameplay and narrative archetypes, providing players with variety and having quirks related to how they were raised. Duran was portrayed as a typical serious heroic figure, with Hawkeye being his direct opposite. Kevin was included as the team wanted a transforming character. Charlotte was compared to Popoi from Secret of Mana, as she had a cheerful demeanour despite a dark past. Angela appears selfish and brash due to the neglect from her mother, while Riesz's narrative focuses on her ""brother complex"" due to losing her own mother at a young age. The artwork was designed to emulate a picture book more than anything realistic, emphasised with the use of soft colors. Much of the basic narrative was conceived by Tanaka, though due to hardware limitations and production time, the amount of variation between individual storylines was limited.

Localization
During the game's development and after its release in Japan on September 30, 1995, Seiken Densetsu 3 became known abroad as Secret of Mana 2, though a preview in Next Generation in August 1995 called it by its original name, despite still stating it to be a sequel to Secret of Mana. The preview noted the six characters, calendar system, and a game world ""three to four times"" the size of the previous game, though it also reported that the game would be playable by three players, not two. Square stated in a 1995 issue of its North American newsletter that they planned to release the game during the second half of the year. A second preview in Next Generation in February 1996, calling the game Secret of Mana 2, stated that the game's North American release had been canceled by Square's American branch due to programming bugs that they deemed impossible to fix in a timely manner.

Before 2019, Seiken Densetsu 3 was not released outside Japan. Retro Gamer stated in 2011 that localizing the game for North America or Europe ""would have cost a fortune"", and that the rise of the competing PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles diminished the benefits of spending so much on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game. Another proposed reason was lackluster sales of Secret of Mana overseas. Nintendo Power, a few months after Seiken Densetsu 3 was released in Japan, said that the probability of a North American release for the game was low due to issues of ""a technical nature"" and that it would have been far too costly to produce at the time. This is further supported by Brian Fehdrau, lead programmer for Square's contemporary game Secret of Evermore, who mentioned that Seiken Densetsu 3 had some software bugs, hindering its likelihood of being certified for release by Nintendo of America without extensive work. In 2020, series producer Masaru Oyamada revealed that the size of the game meant there was no spare capacity on the cartridge for localization data.

There was an apparent misconception among video game fans that the SNES title Secret of Evermore was released in lieu of an English language version of Seiken Densetsu 3 in 1995. Secret of Evermore was developed by a new team at Square's office in Redmond, Washington called Square Soft. According to Fehdrau, no one who worked on the Evermore project would have been involved in a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore. In 1999, a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made available on the internet as an unofficial patch, which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device.

Following the Japanese release of the Seiken Densetsu Collection, a compilation of the first three games of the Mana series, for the Nintendo Switch on June 1, 2017, staff at Square Enix became aware of overseas interest for the compilation. During the development for the upcoming remake, members of Square Enix's Western teams suggested that the original title be made available as well. In order to localize the game, a revisiting of the original development environment for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was done, which required assistance from Nintendo. There was little trouble with localizing the title due to the expanded storage capacities of the Switch. Work on localizing the game to English and other European languages took about a year. Ishii requested that the title include a word with the number ""3"" in it for the remake. Square Enix decided on ""Trials of Mana"" because it referred to the trials of the protagonists, only three of six characters could be selected evolving into ""triangle stories"", and it included the prefix ""tri"" bearing the number ""3"" in accordance with Ishii's wishes. The localized game, now titled Trials of Mana, was finally brought overseas as part of the Collection of Mana, which was released on June 11, 2019 in North America and the PAL region.

Music

The score for Seiken Densetsu 3 was composed by Hiroki Kikuta, who had previously composed the music for Secret of Mana as his first video game score. Kikuta performed the sound selection, editing, effect design, and data encoding himself. Just as he did for Secret of Mana, Kikuta spent nearly 24 hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, ""immersive"" and ""three-dimensional"". Similarly, rather than use premade MIDI samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own MIDI samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super Famicom so that he would know exactly how the pieces would sound on the system's hardware instead of having to deal with audio hardware differences between the original MIDI sampler and the SNES. The soundtrack's music has been described by Freddie W. of RPGFan as ""bouncy, energetic, flowing, and serene"", and is noted for its use of piano and drums. He further called it a ""more refined and matured"" version of the Secret of Mana soundtrack.

The 1995 soundtrack album Seiken Densetsu 3 Original Sound Version collects 60 tracks of music from Seiken Densetsu 3. It was published by NTT Publishing, and republished by Square Enix in 2004. The main theme from Secret of Mana, ""Angel's Fear"", is also featured in Seiken Densetsu 3 as a part of ""Where Angels Fear to Tread"". In addition to the original soundtrack album, an arranged album of music from Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 was produced in 1993 as Secret of Mana+. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. Secret of Mana+ contains a single track, titled ""Secret of Mana"", that incorporates themes from the music of both Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was still under development at the time. The style of the album has been described by critics as ""experimental"", using ""strange sounds"" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and ""typing"" sounds. Secret of Mana+ was originally published by NTT Publishing/Square, and was reprinted by NTT Publishing in 1995 and 2004.

The track ""Meridian Child"" from the original soundtrack was performed by the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra for the fifth Orchestral Game Concert in 1996. ""Meridian Child"" was again performed on February 6, 2011, when the Eminence Symphony Orchestra played a concert in Tokyo as part of the Game Music Laboratory concert series as a tribute to the music of Kenji Ito and Hiroki Kikuta. One of the companion books of sheet music for the Mana series, the first edition of Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music, included pieces from Seiken Densetsu 3, rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though intended to sound like the originals.

Reception

Due to its Japanese exclusivity, most of the English-language reviews for Seiken Densetsu 3 were published years after the initial release. One contemporary English-language review was in 1995 in GameFan, which covered import games and rated the game highly. The Japanese Famitsu review also rated the game highly, though slightly lower than Secret of Mana. The Brazilian SuperGamePower magazine also gave it a positive contemporary review, noting it as having some of the best graphics of any game on the SNES. Critics have also rated the game highly in retrospective reviews, published mostly after the release of the fan translation patch in 2000. The graphics were praised; a review from 1UP.com called the game ""absolutely gorgeous"", which they attributed to its position towards the end of the era of 2D SNES games, but before developers tried to start working with prerendered 3D graphics. A review by Chris Parsons of RPGamer agreed, terming the graphics ""awesome"" and positively comparing some of the effects to PlayStation RPGs, which the Cubed3 review by Adam Riley did as well. A preview by Next Generation written after the release of the game in Japan stated that the detailed graphics ""puts just about every other recent 32-bit RPG to shame"", while the review by Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life also noted the game as one of the best graphically on the SNES and called out the unique visual styles of each area in the game as of particular note. The game's music was also generally praised; Nintendo Lifes Dillard called it ""spectacular from start to finish"", while Cubed3s Riley said it was ""one of the most sonically pleasing out of the whole SNES lifetime"" and RPGamers Parsons said that ""a wonderful job was done in the composition of the music"". The Next Generation preview praised both the quality of the soundtrack and the musical continuity from the Secret of Mana soundtrack.

The gameplay was highly rated by most reviewers, though the combat system had detractors. Dillard of Nintendo Life felt that the gameplay was as good as that of Secret of Mana and it had ""a much more strategic feel to it"". The 1UP.com and Cubed3 reviews also brought up the day and time system as interesting additions, though the 1UP.com reviewer felt that the combat was not ""quite as tight"" as in Secret of Mana. The Next Generation preview, while acknowledging that several flaws in the Secret of Mana combat system had been corrected and praising the boss battles, felt that the computer-controlled characters showed no sense of tactics, resulting in a free-for-all. A review by JeuxVideo.com also noted several improvements in the combat system over the prior game, but felt that battles could turn into a chaotic mass of attacks and numbers. Parsons of RPGamer also called out the Ring system as being flawed, as he found it frustrating that the menu could not be brought up while a character was performing an action, making boss battles hectic and difficult. The JeuxVideo.com reviewer also took issue with this restriction.

The plot received mixed reviews; while several reviewers praised the system of choosing different main characters, especially its effect on replayability, Cubed3s Riley felt that it meant that the story ""can be quite confusing"". Parsons noted that the interactions with the characters that were not chosen often left plot holes, as their motivations were not explained. The Famitsu review praised the replayability of the branching narrative. The Next Generation preview, while praising the multiple storylines as an innovation in the genre, felt that it had been attached to a ""magic-and-monsters fantasy-formula"" plot. The 1UP.com reviewer agreed, saying that the plot was not ""too terribly engaging"", suffering from clichés and flat characters.

Overall, the game is regarded by many as a SNES classic; Nintendo Lifes Dillard stated that it was ""easily one of the best RPGs to come out of the 16-bit era"", while the 1UP.com reviewer said that if it had been officially translated into English it ""very likely would have become a fondly remembered classic"".

Remake

A remake of the game, released under the official localized title, was announced at E3 2019 for a worldwide release for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC in early 2020. It was released worldwide on April 24 of that year. Beginning production in 2017, the remake was produced with the aim of staying true to the original while reimagining it using 3D graphics and with an expanded, modernized gameplay system.

(Two other security agencies are the Military Intelligence and the General Intelligence Directorate which traditionally specializes in foreign intelligence gathering.) Its main responsibilities are counter-intelligence, internal and border security, counter-terrorism, and surveillance.  The agency is under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry and is headquartered in Cairo. It ""remains the most visible"" of Egypt's security agencies  and according to one estimate has about ""100,000 employees and at least as many informants"".

The old Security Service has been described as ""detested"" and ""widely hated"", and following 2011 Egyptian revolution its headquarters was stormed  by protesters who made off with records.
The National Security Agency was ""established"" (according to at least one source it is simply the old State Security Investigations Service with a new name) after the  2013 coup d'état that ousted Morsi and installed General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.  Nearly a hundred of the sacked senior officers of State Security Investigations Service were rehired.
 
Due to the wave of pro-military nationalism in Egypt and the agency's efforts to improve security during the Islamist unrest, the agency has gained much of the  old Security Service's lost respect in Egypt according to Sarah El Deeb of the Associated Press. After announcing the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group due to the December 2013 Mansoura bombing, the agency assigned hotlines for the public to report suspected Muslim Brotherhood members, and was reportedly ""reclaiming a major role"" and rebuilding its network of informants that had been weakened during the Arab Spring

On the other hand, Declan Walsh of the New York Times states that after the agency was established, torture chambers were reopened.
Opposition leaders, fearing arrest, fled the country. Human rights monitors started to count the numbers of the ‘‘disappeared’’ — critics who vanished into state custody without arrest or trial — until the monitors, too, began to disappear.

El Deeb quotes a campaigner for reform of the security agencies, former police officer Mohammed Mahfouz, who complains that ""no specific law regulates the agency's workings, making it largely unaccountable""; and another activist, Wael Abbas, who calls the NSA ""a corrupt agency"" that ""has only changed names"" and ""is now more vicious than before.""

Macon County comprises the Decatur, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History
Macon County was formed on January 19, 1829, out of Shelby County. It was named for Nathaniel Macon, a Colonel in the Revolutionary War. Macon later served as senator from North Carolina until his resignation in 1828. In 1830, future US President Abraham Lincoln and his family moved to Macon County.

Geography

According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.9%) is water.

Macon County is primarily flat, as is most of the state and all of the surrounding counties, the result of geological activity during the Pleistocene epoch. During the Illinoian Stage of the Pleistocene, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered about 85 percent of Illinois, including the Macon County area. The subsequent thaw of the region and retreat of the ice sheet left central Illinois with its present characteristic flat topography.

Because of its central location, Macon County is often referred to as ""The Heart of Illinois.""

Climate and weather

In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Decatur have ranged from a low of  in January to a high of  in July, although a record low of  was recorded in February 1905 and a record high of  was recorded in July 1954.

Politics
In its early years Macon County favored the Democratic Party, voting for it in every election through 1856. Republican Abraham Lincoln won the county in his landmark 1860 election, and from then until the Great Depression Macon County became solidly Republican, only giving a narrow plurality to Woodrow Wilson in 1912 when the GOP was mortally divided by Theodore Roosevelt's splinter–party run.

The FDR-era New Deal saw the county become more amenable to the Democratic Party again due to its strong industrial base. Macon County voted for the winner in every election from 1920 through 1996 save in 1960, 1968, and 1988, in two of which it voted for a losing Democrat over a winning Republican (Humphrey over Nixon in 1968 and Dukakis over George H. W. Bush in 1988). In 2000, Macon voted for a losing Democrat for the third time since the New Deal, as Al Gore narrowly held the county, but since then the county has once again trended Republican, as George W. Bush carried the county over John Kerry in 2004 with the same vote share as Reagan in his 1984 national landslide. Illinois native Barack Obama did carry the county with a plurality in his sweeping 2008 triumph, but was convincingly defeated by Mitt Romney in the county in 2012. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got the lowest vote share of any Democrat since George McGovern; and while Joe Biden improved on her vote share in 2020, he still failed to match McGovern's percentage.

She was later transferred to the French Navy as Scorpion (A728). She was sold to Malaysian owners but sank while under tow from the former French ship  when that ship struck a reef off Cikobia Island, Fiji, on 30 July 1978 and also sank.

Career 
Yew (YN-37) was laid down on 22 May 1941 at Camden, New Jersey, by John H. Mathis & Company; launched on 4 October 1941; sponsored by Miss Alice E. Morgan, daughter of Comdr. A. L. Morgan, USN (Ret.); and placed in service on 1 July 1942.
 
Records for Yew's service are practically nonexistent. The fragmentary evidence available shows that the ship was reclassified AN-37 on 1 January 1944. The net tender was ultimately decommissioned at Oran, Algeria, on 30 November 1944 and simultaneously transferred to the French Navy under lend-lease.

She served as Scorpion (A728) until she was nominally returned by the French on 21 March 1949 but was sold outright to the French on the same day. Her American name, Yew, was struck from the Navy List on 28 April 1949.
 
Scorpion served the French Navy into the mid-1970s before she was sunk at Cikobia Island, Fiji, 30 July 1978.

265,26576015,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milim,Milim,"""Milim"" (Hebrew: מילים, English: ""Words"") is a song recorded by the Israeli singer, Harel Skaat. It was the Israeli song entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 where the Israeli entry finished 14th despite being one of the favorites.

History
""Milim"" was selected to be the Israeli song entry for Eurovision after winning the Kdam Eurovision 2010 in March 2010, beating out three other finalists. The selection was decided by a combination of juries' and public votes. It received maximum points from all juries as well as the televoters A special CD entitled ""Eurovision 2010"" was released by Skaat and contains all four songs featured in the KDAM. Both the CD and song are also available on iTunes (""Milim"" is listed under the English title of ""Words"").

Despite finishing in 14th place, Israel swept the Eurovision sanctioned Marcel Bezencon Awards. Adaddi and Horev won the Composer Award, while Skaat won the Artistic Award for best singer and Skaat and ""Milim"" won the Press Award for best entry. The awards are selected by participating composers, and accredited press and media, and commentators of the Eurovision contest. In contrast to the way most songs were presented at Eurovision, Israel opted for a simple presentation with Skaat in a black suit with Adaddi playing on a grand piano, and two backup singers to Skaat's left in the back of him.

""Milim"" has been described as a power ballad. The song shares similar qualities with some of Skaat's other songs, most notably his award-winning hit, ""Veat"". At the press conference after the second Eurovision rehearsal in Oslo, Adaddi said, ""We didn't write the song for the Eurovision, as much as for Harel Skaat, who I think is an amazing singer and he interprets the song in a way that I don't know anybody else can do with such passion and also with a beautiful voice."" The song starts out quietly and builds throughout until it reaches a loud crescendo near the end of the song. In between the time the song was selected at the Kdam and the Eurovision contest, the Israeli team revised the song's vocal arrangement and re-recorded the song with a full philharmonic orchestra backing.

Skaat released both a French and an English version of the song, as well as a music video. The French lyrics are by former Eurovision winner, Anne Marie David It also has been reported that Skaat plans to record and release a Spanish version of the song, with the lyrics translated by Marta Gomez, who has previously worked with Idan Raichel.

""Milim"" was a hit on Israeli radio stations throughout the Spring of 2010 and spent a total of five weeks at number one on the Reshet Gimmel Chart, one of the major music charts in Israel, including that of the entire month of May 2010.

In an interview prior to the Eurovision contest, Skaat explained what the song was about to him. He said, ""The song 'Milim' is about separation of any kind. Separation of lovers, of a family. In Hebrew, 'Milim' means words. The words are the most memorable thing we have after a separation, words are very powerful and they are engraved in our minds and hearts. Sadly, my beloved grandfather suddenly passed away the week of the Israeli pre-selection competition, which gave the lyrics of 'Milim' a very personal and difficult meaning to me."" The song lyrics seem to suggest that the person singing the song has been left alone while his or her loved one has left, perhaps permanently. Household items and architectural details are mentioned throughout the song—fallen ceiling, scratched handles, arranged books, and windows with cracked glass. The song contains the refrain, ""Hish'art li rak milim"" (English version: ""You left me only words""), which is repeated throughout the chorus.

Russian version

Слова остались мне (The words remained to me) is a song by Belarusian singer Eugene Litvinkovich, released in 2012 as a cover for ""Milim"". The Russian version of the song was firstly presented on Ukrainian TV series X-Factor at 6 October 2012. The author is Noam Horev, the interpreter - N. Dorofeeva. The song became first single from the debut album ""Znaki Zodiaka"". The song is about a girl which tries to forget the character of the song.

Location, history, architectural and artistic features 

The church is situated at 4 km from the small town of Boboshevo. It is a small one-nave edifice with internal dimension of 4,15 m to 2,66 m and height of 5,50 m. It has a semi-round apse which is 1,38 m wide and 0,70 m deep. On the eastern side to the left of the apse there is a semi-round niche (0,45 x 0,52 x 0,37 m) and on the northern side - a rectangular one (0,20 x 0,20 x 0,25 m). The entrance is to the west and is 1,85 m high and 1,25 m wide. The vault is semi-cylindrical. A narthex was added in 1864 with entrance to the north and five arched windows. The floor of the naos is covered with stone plates.

The whole interior of the church with exception of the narthex is covered with frescoes which is traditional for that type of church. Several artistic traditions have been applied; the figures are dynamic, the characters are emotional and the faces - vivid. The shades are dark, saturated and harmonized. On the vault there are three medallions - one the central one is painted Christ with four angels. On its sides in the two smaller medallions are the images of the prophets - Moses, Aaron, Ezekiel and others. Under them are depicted two layers of scenes: upper layer which includes the big holidays - the Birth, Baptism, Crucifixion and others; and a lower layer with the Passion of Christ. On the northern and southern walls of the church under the Passion there is another frieze of medallions depicting the warrior saints, the three men in the Babylon furnace and others. In the bottom parts of the walls are depicted full-length portraits of saints. On the western wall is depicted the Assumption of Mary and under that scene on the two sides of the door are the images of the sainted rulers Constantine and Helen and Archangel Michael.

The church was built after 1481 and the frescoes were made after 1488 as seen by the inscription on the door of the naos.

The icons in the iconostasis of the church (dated from 1729) are kept in the crypt of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia, and part of the surviving manuscripts of the monastery are kept in Ecclesiastical Museum of History in the capital.

The church was declared an architectural-artistic monument of culture with national importance (DV, is.38/1972).

The church was part of the medieval monastery of St Demetrius. The monastery was established in the 10th century and its initial position was above the village of Skrino. The famous Bulgarian saint John of Rila became monk in that monastery. The monastery was destroyed after the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars and the fall of the Second Empire. It was rebuilt during the reign of the Ottoman sultan Bayazid II (1481-1512) but not in its original position but to the south-east near Boboshevo. Throughout the following centuries the monastery was an important literary centre for the Bulgarian people. After the Liberation the monastery declined and became uninhabited, its control was first taken by the Municipality of Boboshevo and later by the local priests. Around 1930 the monastery included dwellings, kitchen, bakery, granary and other buildings. At that time the monastery owned 694 decares of land in the eastern slopes of the Ruen mountain which included forests, lawns, fields, orchards and vineyards. Only the church has been preserved today and has undergone a comprehensive restoration.

The church was named after Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki - one of the most important Eastern Orthodox saints born in the 3rd century in the city of Solun.

269,51842729,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony%20Walker%20Jr.,Anthony Walker Jr.,"Anthony Laron Walker Jr. (born August 8, 1995) is an American football linebacker for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Northwestern and was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft.

College career
Walker first saw action in his redshirt freshman season when Collin Ellis went down with a series of injuries. In his first career game, Walker returned an interception for a touchdown against Penn State that capped a Northwestern win. In his first full season as a starter, Walker found success as he recorded 122 tackles to lead the team and 20.5 tackles for loss which was fourth in the nation. For his performance that season, Walker received All-American recognition from the AP and Sports Illustrated as well as Consensus First-Team All Big 10 honors. On November 29, 2016, Walker was named Second Team All-Big Ten.

Professional career

Indianapolis Colts

2017
The Indianapolis Colts selected Walker in the fifth round (161st overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. Walker was the 20th linebacker drafted in 2017.

On May 11, 2017, the Indianapolis Colts signed Walker to a four-year, $2.66 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $265,413.

Walker missed organized team activities due to Northwestern's quarters schedule and the league's rules on rookies being unable to join their team until their school's final semester had concluded. Upon entering training camp, Walker competed to be a starting inside linebacker against Sean Spence, Antonio Morrison, Jon Bostic, and Edwin Jackson. Head coach Chuck Pagano named Walker a backup inside linebacker to begin the regular season, behind Jon Bostic and Antonio Morrison.

He made his professional regular season debut in the Indianapolis Colts' season-opener at the Los Angeles Rams, but exited in the second quarter of their 46–9 loss after sustaining a hamstring injury. His hamstring injury sidelined him for the next three games (Weeks 2–4). In Week 5, he aggravated his hamstring injury during the third quarter of a 26–23 win against the San Francisco 49ers and was inactive for the next three games (Weeks 6–8). On December 29, 2017, Walker earned his first start after Jon Bostic was ruled inactive due to an injury. He collected a season-high nine combined tackles in the Colts' 23–16 loss at the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16. On December 31, 2017, the Indianapolis Colts fired head coach Chuck Pagano after the Colts finished 4–12 in 2017. He finished his rookie season in 2017 with 22 combined tackles (11 solo) in ten games and two starts.

2018
On February 11, 2018, the Indianapolis Colts hired former Philadelphia Eagles' offensive coordinator Frank Reich as their new head coach. Defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus opted to change the base 3-4 defense and implemented a base 4-3 defense. Walker entered training camp slated as the starting middle linebacker, but saw competition from Najee Goode. On July 31, 2018, it was reported that Walker had injured his groin in the first week of training camp and was sidelined for the remainder of training camp and all four preseason games. Head coach Frank Reich named Walker the starting middle linebacker to start the regular season in 2018, alongside outside linebackers Najee Goode and rookie Darius Leonard.

On September 23, 2018, Walker recorded nine combined tackles and made his first career interception off a pass by Eagles' quarterback Carson Wentz during a 20–16 loss at the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2.

2019
In Week 13 against the Tennessee Titans, Walker recorded a team high 12 tackles and forced a fumble on running back Derrick Henry on the first play of the game which was recovered by teammate Malik Hooker in the 31–17 loss.
In Week 16 against the Carolina Panthers, Walker recorded 10 tackles, sacked rookie quarterback Will Grier once, and intercepted a pass thrown by Grier during the 38–6 win.
In Week 17 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Walker recorded a team high 16 tackles during the 38–20 loss.

2020
In Week 5 against the Cleveland Browns, Walker recorded his first interception off a pass thrown by Baker Mayfield during the 32–23 loss.
In Week 13 against the Houston Texans, Walker recovered a fumble lost by Deshaun Watson late in the fourth quarter to secure a 26–20 win for the Colts.

Cleveland Browns 
On March 19, 2021, Walker signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Browns. Walker was placed on injured reserve with a hamstring injury on September 17, 2021. He was activated on October 9 for Week 5.

Located just south of Brandon Avenue SW (U.S. 11) at 3820 Belle Aire Circle SW, Belle Aire was completed in 1849 as the private residence of Madison and Margeret Pitzer on a knoll overlooking their  of land adjacent to the Roanoke River.  It is located approximately one-half mile from his brother Jeramiah's house (Mount Airy). Today the home still stands, with the surrounding area now developed as single family home typical of those built during the 1970s-80s.

History
Belle Aire was constructed by Benjamin Deyerle and his carpenter Gustave A. Sedon (also known as Gustavus Sedon) for the Pitzer family in 1849. Its Greek Revival embellishments were influenced by the New England architect Asher Benjamin's publication The Practical House Carpenter of 1830. The L-shaped home is of brick construction with stuccoed Doric pilasters at the corners. Its most recognizable feature is its 2-story pedimented portico four fluted Doric columns at each level. A kitchen addition replaced the original outbuilding and the side portico has been enclosed. Otherwise, Belle Aire remains much as it was in 1850. Today the home remains as a private residence.  It became a Virginia Historic Landmark in 1966 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

280,961585,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave%20Chomiak,Dave Chomiak,"David Walter Chomiak (born February 15, 1953) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Greg Selinger.

Chomiak was born in Winnipeg and grew up in East Kildonan, graduating from Miles Macdonell Collegiate; he lives in the West Kildonan area.  He worked as a lawyer before entering politics, and was a member of the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre, the Canadian Shield Foundation and the Big Brother's Association of Manitoba.

Chomiak was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1990 provincial election, in the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonan.  He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate David Langtry by 210 votes; Progressive Party leader Sidney Green finished fourth.  After the election, Chomiak joined with 19 other NDP MLAs as the official opposition to Gary Filmon's government.

Chomiak was re-elected in the 1995 election, defeating Tory Robert Praznik 5812 votes to 3624.  He again increased his margin of victory in the 1999 election, defeating PC candidate Shannon Martin by 6101 votes to 2542.  The NDP won this election, and Chomiak was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Health and Minister responsible for Sport.  He was relieved of responsibility for Sport on January 17, 2001.

In 2003, Chomiak supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

In 2003, he was re-elected in the once-marginal riding of Kildonan with over 70% of the vote.  On October 12, 2004, he was appointed as Manitoba's Minister of Energy, Science and Technology, with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act and the Manitoba Hydro Act. Chomiak had been the longest-serving health minister in Canada prior to this shuffle, and there were rumours that he requested a transfer to a less stressful portfolio.

In September 2006, Chomiak was appointed as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, and to the Manitoba Public Insurance and Manitoba Gaming Control Commission in Gary Doer's new cabinet.

Chomiak is anti-abortion, but as health minister never sought to criminalize abortions.  He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

In the 2016 provincial election, he was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Nic Curry.

282,19868611,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luck%27s%20Incorporated,Luck's Incorporated,"Luck's Incorporated was a food production company founded in Seagrove, North Carolina, in 1947, which produced a line of canned bean and other canned food products. For a period of time, it was one of the largest employers in the area and its canned food products were a staple in many Southern homes. It is a brand of Faribault Foods, after a divestment by ConAgra in 2010.

History 

The company was founded as the Mountain View Cannery in 1947 by Ivey B. Luck, Alfred Spencer & H. Clay Presnell. Spencer & Presnell later sold out to Luck and the establishment became known as Luck's. Luck's specialized in pinto beans and other canned vegetables and food products, employed many Seagrove and surrounding area families, and was a major buyer of vegetable, fruit, and poultry farms in the Randolph County Area and from around the region. Luck's canned food products were sold across much of the Southeast during the 1950s and is still a popular brand today.

Merged and Acquired 

In 1967, Luck's merged with American Home Products. In 2000, the food interests of American Home Products, known as International Home Foods, were acquired by ConAgra Foods.

In 2010, the brand was sold to Arizona Canning Company, a subsidiary of La Costeña, for US$14 million. In 2014, La Costeña acquired Faribault Foods and merged Arizona Canning into Faribault.

Luck's Headquarters and Cannery 

The original company headquarters and cannery is located at 798 State Highway 705 in Seagrove, North Carolina. For a period of time Luck's also operated a cannery in Aberdeen, North Carolina.

The Luck's cannery in Seagrove was closed by ConAgra in 2002. The location was reopened eight months later and operated by Seagrove Foods, Inc., a fully independent company.

Currently, some of the warehouse space is used for local community events.

To date, twenty one countries in various parts of the world have ratified the ReCAAP agreement.

ReCAAP History

The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) is the first regional government-to-government agreement to promote and enhance cooperation against piracy and armed robbery against ships in Asia. ReCAAP ISC was proposed in 1999 as a result of shared concern specifically related to cases of piracy and armed robbery, and it came into force in November 2006 after further ratification by member states. To date, 21 States (14 Asian countries, 5 European countries, Australia, the USA) have become Contracting Parties to ReCAAP.

The 21 Contracting Parties of ReCAAP:
(As of August 2021)

The Structure of ReCAAP 
ReCAAP was established as a decentralized security network, which included the formation of an Information Security Center (ISC) and a Governing Council. The ISC also serves as a platform for information exchange with the ReCAAP Focal Points via the Information Network System (IFN). The Governing Council consists of one representative from each contracting member and is tasked with overseeing a focal point and managing the ISC's procedures.

ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre (ISC)

The ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre (ReCAAP ISC) was established under the Agreement and was officially launched on 29 November 2006 in Singapore. Masafumi Kuroki is the current executive director.

The emergence of the ISC has created the interaction to minimize the acts of piracy and robbery to occur in maritime security territory. It provides epistemic analysis assistance to prevent and improve the ability of the authorities to deal with the issues of piracy through three pillars: Sharing regional security information, capacity building measures, and cooperative arrangement planning.

Information Sharing
The ReCAAP ISC conducts timely and accurate information sharing on incidents of piracy and sea robbery.  The ReCAAP ISC manages a network of information sharing with the Focal Points of Contracting Parties on 24/7 basis. Through this information sharing, the ReCAAP ISC can issue warnings and alerts to the shipping industry and facilitate the responses by the law enforcement agencies of littoral states.  Based on the detailed information of incidents collected, verified and collated, the ReCAAP ISC provides accurate statistics and analysis of the piracy and armed robbery situation in Asia by its periodical reports (weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports).

Information sharing mainly refers to:

 The formation of a decentralized security network simplifying communication between the ISC and the Focal Points 
 The launch of an IFN mobile app in 2014 to increase the accessibility of reporting incidents 
 The publication of reports, alerts and updates, as well as forums and conferences from accurate reporting by Focal Points

Capacity Building
In order to strengthen its network of information sharing, the ReCAAP ISC conducts capacity building activities of the Focal Points of the Contracting Parties through the training of their reporting skill, sharing best practices, updating the situation of piracy and armed robbery.  It also facilitates the Focal Points to promote cooperation with other governmental agencies and shipping industry. The representatives that make up the Governing Council are tasked with overseeing a specific focal point and foster the ISC's procedures.

Cooperative Arrangements
The ReCAAP ISC promotes cooperation with other regional and international organisations (governmental organisations and shipping associations) to share information and best practices and to enhance its network in order to address the piracy and armed robbery collectively. It has signed documents of cooperation with like-minded organisations such as IMO, INTERPOL, BIMCO, INTERTANKO, ASA, IFC and the Djibouti Code of Conduct (DCoC).

Cooperative arrangements can, for example, include workshops where the contracting members share best practices and experiences.

Evaluation of Incidents 
ReCAAP's periodical reports document the severity levels and locations of the accidents, highlight case studies to recognize patterns and trends, and share best practices for safety precautions.

The ISC evaluates the significance of all incidents in terms of two considerations: the level of violence (including the use of weapons, the treatment of the crew, and the number of pirates/robbers involved), and the level of economics (including the type of property that has been impacted by an assault).

Based on the matrix of indicators of the Violence, -, and Economic factors, ReCAAP ISC essentially categorizes all incidents into one of four groups 

The four classifications of incidents are as follows:

 CAT 1 (Most severe incidents): Involves more than 9 men as perpetrators in which they mostly are armed. The crew is also likely to suffer physical violence, and the ship is either hijacked or the cargo is stolen. 
 CAT 2 – Involves around 4-9 men. They are likely to be armed and the crew is likely to be threatened. In some cases, the crew suffers physical violence. The perpetrators may steal cash or property. 
 CAT 3 – Involves around 1-6 men. The perpetrators are sometimes armed, but the crew does not usually suffer from physical violence. In most cases, the perpetrators are unable to steal anything from the ship or cargo. 
 CAT 4 – (Less severe incidents): Involves around 1-3 men. The perpetrators are not armed, and the crew are not harmed. Perpetrators escape empty-handed.

This categorization of occurrences enables the ReCAAP ISC to provide some context to the pirate and armed robbery situation in Asia, as well as to assist the maritime community in risk analysis.

Club football
Oberer started his football with FC Basel and advanced to their first team in their 1941–42 season under Manager Eugen Rupf. After one test match, Oberer played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 26 August 1941 as Basel won 5–1 against Concordia Basel. He scored his first league goal for his club one week later on 2 November in the away game against SC Zug. It was the winning goal and Basel won 1–0.

Oberer transferred out and continued his playing career with Montreux-Sports, who played one league lower. He remained with Montreux for two seasons.

For Basel's 1944–45 season Oberer transferred back to his club of origin. But the season ran badly and they were relegated at the end of it. Because they had suffered relegation, the clear aim for the next season was to obtain immediate promotion. Oberer scored five goals in one league match, including three goals in a row in the 70th, 75th and 80 minute, against FC Helvetia Bern on 16 December 1945. Basel won the match 10–0. In the return game in Bern against Helvetia, Oberer scored another hat-trick as Basel won 6–1. This time he achieved three goals in a row in the 77th, 80th and 83rd minute, within six minutes of each other. With his club at the end of their 1945–46 season he gained promotion from the Nationalliga B to the Nationalliga A (now called Swiss Super League). The two youngsters in the team together scored more than half of the team's 87 goals. René Bader was the team's top goal scorer with 27 goals, Oberer was second best scorer with 20 goals.

In Basel's 1946–47 season Oberer won the Swiss Cup with his club. Oberer was the team's top league goal scorer with 13 goals and he achieved two further hat-tricks during that league season. The following season in the cup match on 26 October 1947 against Balerna, Oberer scored his first hat-trick in this competition.

Between the years 1941 to 1942 and again from 1944 to 1948, Oberer played a total of 151 games for Basel scoring a total of 81 goals. 93 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, 17 in the Swiss Cup and 42 were friendly games. He scored 42 goals in the domestic league, 11 in the cup competition and the other 28 were scored during the test games.

In the 1949–50 season he played with Cantonal Neuchâtel (later Xamax) before moving to Chiasso for two years. Again in the 1952–53 season he return to play another year for Cantonal before returning to Chiasso for three further seasons. Oberer ended his playing career after the 1956–57 season, this was his third spell with Cantonal.

National team
Oberer gained three caps for the Swiss national football team. His debut was on 18 September 1949 in the away game against Luxembourg, a 3–2 win, in which he scored a goal. His second game was in the away defeat suffered against Belgium just two weeks later. Oberers third and final national team game was on 19 March 1950 as Switzerland drew 3–3 in the away tie against Austria. In the Praterstadion in front of 62,000 spectators Oberer scored the last goal to secure the draw.

Personal life
Oberer died in Basel, Switzerland on 19 April 1974, at the age of 49.

Rocket was based on movements from Sean Gunn and an actual raccoon named Oreo. Rocket is depicted as a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers who is a hot-tempered mercenary and weapons expert.

, Rocket has appeared in four films and he will return in the upcoming films Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), as well as The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022).

Concept and creation

The comic book character was created by Bill Mantlo and Keith Giffen, and inspired by the Beatles song ""Rocky Raccoon"". Rocket Raccoon first appeared in Marvel Preview #7 (Summer 1976), in the back-up feature ""The Sword in the Star"", under the name ""Rocky"". He would next appear in The Incredible Hulk #271 (May 1982), where it is learned that ""Rocky"" is short for ""Rocket"". In 1985, he received his own four-issue limited series and in an afterword to the first issue, Mantlo himself asserted that this was the same character seen in Preview, penciled by Mike Mignola and inked by Al Gordon with Al Milgrom. Rocket appeared in Quasar #15 in 1990 and later appeared in three issues of Sensational She-Hulk in 1992 (#44–46). The character only appeared in a total of ten comic books in his first thirty years of existence. Besides a brief appearance in a 2006 issue of Exiles, Rocket Raccoon was next seen in 2007's Annihilation: Conquest and Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord limited series, and their spin-off series, a new volume of Guardians of the Galaxy. He remained a regular member of the series cast until it was canceled with issue #25 in 2010.

Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige first mentioned Guardians of the Galaxy as a potential film at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, stating, ""There are some obscure titles, too, like Guardians of the Galaxy. I think they've been revamped recently in a fun way in the [comic] book."" Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of Entertainment Weekly, saying, ""There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which Thor sort of hints at, in the cosmic side"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to X-Men and The Avengers. Feige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He said the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket. In August 2013, Marvel announced that Bradley Cooper would voice Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy.

Characterization
In Guardians of the Galaxy, Rocket was characterized as a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics. Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was ""not a cartoon character"", saying, ""It's not Bugs Bunny in the middle of the Avengers, it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine"". Gunn also based the character on himself. Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, ""I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy.""

Cooper voiced Rocket, while Sean Gunn (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming. James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movements from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, were recorded as potential references for the animators, though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film. Sean noted they ""kind of stumbled"" into the process of him performing on set since they ""weren't sure how we were going to create that character"". The same process continued to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket. Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone who could balance ""the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket."" In addition to Cooper's voice and Sean Gunn's movements, the appearance of Rocket was based on an actual raccoon named Oreo. James Gunn said of the process, ""We needed a raccoon to study how he looked and his behavior, so that our on-screen raccoon, which is generated through CGI will be realistic. Our Rocket is based on a combination of our voice actor, Bradley Cooper, our on-set actor, my brother Sean Gunn, the movements and behavior and look of Oreo [the raccoon], as well as my own animation"". Gunn brought Oreo to the red carpet premiere of the film.

In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Sean Gunn once again served as the stand-in for the character during filming, with Cooper's performance also referenced. Sean Gunn said that ""Rocket has the same sort of crisis of faith [that he had in the first film] about whether or not he belongs in this family"", with James Gunn adding, ""this is really about Rocket coming to terms with accepting his place within a group of people, which probably seemed like a good idea"" when they were heroes together at the end of the first film, but now ""he's just not very comfortable with the idea"". Feige stated that the relationship between Rocket and Groot has changed, saying, ""Groot was Rocket's protector in the first movie, [and now] Rocket is Groot's protector.""

Oreo died in 2019, at the age of ten.

Fictional character biography

Origins
Rocket's origins are unclear, but he is unique; according to the Nova Corps, he was ""the result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form"". His record with the Nova Corps indicates a lengthy history of theft, arson, and escape from incarceration. At some point in his travels, Rocket becomes friends and partners with Groot, a sentient anthropomorphic tree.

Guardian of the Galaxy

On the planet Xandar, Rocket and Groot attempt to capture Peter Quill for a bounty, interfering in a fight between Quill and Gamora over possession of the Power Stone that Quill had acquired. All four are captured by the Nova Corps and sent to the space prison, the Kyln. Rocket devises a plan to escape from the Kyln, and they escape along with Kyln inmate Drax the Destroyer. The five then travel to Knowhere to sell the Power Stone, where Rocket and Drax have a heated argument. After Drax drunkenly calls powerful enemy Ronan to confront him, and Ronan acquires the Power Stone, Rocket wants to flee, but is convinced by Groot and by Drax's apology to help save Xandar from Ronan's attack. As other members of the group battle Ronan aboard his ship, the Dark Aster, Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster, which crash-lands on Xandar. Groot sacrifices himself to shield Rocket and the others, and the remaining Guardians are able to gain control of the Power Stone and destroy Ronan. Rocket plants a sapling cut from Groot in a pot, which grows into a baby of his species, whom Rocket adopts, also naming Groot in his biological father's honour.

Facing Ego

Two months later, Rocket and the Guardians are hired by the Sovereign to fight off an alien attacking their valuable batteries, in exchange for Nebula. Annoyed by the arrogance of the Sovereign, Rocket steals some of their batteries, leading the Sovereign fleet to chase and attack the Guardians' ship. They crash land on a planet, where Quill meet his father, revealed to be Ego, a primordial Celestial who manifests a human avatar that allows him to interact with other races. Quill, Gamora, and Drax go with Ego to his planet while Rocket and Groot stay behind to watch Nebula and repair the ship. Ravagers arrive searching for Quill and, after a fight, capture Rocket and Groot and free Nebula. The Ravagers mutiny against their leader, Yondu, and aboard the Ravager ship, Rocket and Yondu plot their escape, eventually destroying most of the Ravager vessel except for a breakaway quarter in which they travel to Ego. They learn that Ego is an evil living planet intent on dominating the universe. Quill keeps Ego occupied in combat with his newfound Celestial powers until Rocket is able to assemble a bomb, which the baby Groot places in Ego's brain. Later, Rocket and the rest of the Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu.

Infinity War

Four years later, Rocket and the Guardians respond to a distress signal and end up rescuing Thor, who is floating in space amidst the wreckage of the Statesman. Thor tells them of Thanos' plan to obtain the Infinity Stones, and the Guardians split up, with Rocket and Groot accompanying Thor to Nidavellir to create a new weapon to kill Thanos. On the way, Rocket gives Thor a replacement for an eye Thor has lost. They find an abandoned Nidavellir and meet the dwarf king Eitri. The four work together to create Stormbreaker, a powerful axe that also grants Thor the power of the Bifröst. Thor transports himself, Rocket, and Groot to Wakanda on Earth via the Bifröst to help members of the Avengers, Bucky Barnes, and the Wakandan army in the battle against the Outriders. Despite being severely wounded, Thanos is able to activate the Infinity Gauntlet, snap his fingers, and teleports away. Rocket watches helplessly as Groot weakly calls out ""...Dad?"", as one of half of living things in the universe to dissolve.

Reversing the Blip

Rocket stays with Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, James Rhodes and Thor at the Avengers Compound and witnesses Tony Stark and Nebula’s return, realising that only he and Nebula were the remaining Guardians. After finding Thanos' location, he, Thor, Rogers, Romanoff, Rhodes, Banner, Carol Danvers, and Nebula go into space to confront Thanos and retrieve the Stones. However, after Thanos reveals that he destroyed the Stones, Thor kills him, and they leave defeated.

In 2023, Rocket has joined the Avengers and works on missions in space with Nebula. When a means is discovered to use time travel to reverse the Blip, Rocket and Nebula return to the Compound and Rocket accompanies Banner to New Asgard to convince a depressed Thor to return to help with the effort. Rocket then gives his spaceship to Clint Barton. Using the quantum tunnel, Rocket and Thor travel through the Quantum Realm to an alternate 2013 timeline and go to Asgard to get the Reality Stone, during the time when it had been absorbed into Jane Foster. They retrieve the Stone and return to the Compound in the main timeline, but after Banner uses the new Infinity Gauntlet to undo the Blip, an alternate Thanos attacks, trapping Rocket, Rhodes, and Banner underneath the destroyed Compound. Scott Lang, in his Giant-Man form, saves them, and Rocket joins the battle against alternate Thanos' army, where he is reunited with Groot. A week later, Rocket and the reunited Guardians of the Galaxy attend Stark’s funeral, before leaving with them and Thor into space.

Alternate versions

An alternate version of Rocket appears in the animated series What If...? as a non-speaking character.

Thor's party 

In an alternate 2011, Rocket participates in Thor's intergalactic party on Earth in Las Vegas.

292,7120202,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre%20Bottineau,Pierre Bottineau,"Pierre Bottineau (January 1, 1817 – July 26, 1895) was a Minnesota frontiersman.

Known as the ""Kit Carson of the Northwest,"" he was an integral part of the history and development of Minnesota and North Dakota. He was an accomplished surveyor and his many settlement parties founded cities all over Minnesota and North Dakota. Those settlements would become cities such as Osseo, Minnesota and Maple Grove, Minnesota northwest of the Twin Cities, as well as Breckenridge, Minnesota and Wahpeton, North Dakota on either side of the Red River of the North.

He also took part in the founding of Orono Village, Sherburne County, Minnesota (later absorbed by), Elk River, Minnesota and the booming city of St. Anthony (later absorbed by Minneapolis, Minnesota). He was also a renowned diplomat and translator, earning him the nickname ""The Walking Peace Pipe."" He played a part in forging many treaties with Native American tribes. According to his obituary he spoke French, English, Dakota, Ojibwe, Cree, Mandan, and Winnebago.

Pierre was born in a hunting camp on the buffalo trail near Grand Forks. His father Charles Bottineau was a French-Canadian, and his mother Marguerite Macheyquayzaince Ahdicksongab ""(Clear Sky Woman)"" was half Dakota and half Ojibwe of the Lake of the Woods band, and sister of the Pembina Ojibwe chief Misko-Makwa or Red Bear. 

Although technically born in United States territory, control of the Upper Mississippi Valley fell to the British during the War of 1812. Even after the 1815 Treaty of Ghent returned the land to the United States, British and Canadian traders and the Native American tribes held all real control in the area. The U.S. government used Pierre and others like him to settle the land and help establish American sovereignty. Most mixed race, or Métis, lived as outcasts to both White and Native societies, but Pierre's invaluable  services and exploits would make him a legend in his own time.  Upon his retirement, the United States Congress granted him a pension of $50 a month. He died in Red Lake Falls, Minnesota at the age of 78.

Bottineau County, North Dakota, and its county seat Bottineau, North Dakota, are named in his honor as well as the Pierre Bottineau Library and Bottineau Park in Minneapolis and Bottineau Blvd in Hennepin County, Minnesota. The Bottineau LRT line has been proposed in Minneapolis.

293,6044162,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFA%20%28architecture%29,SAFA (architecture),"SAFA (, , ) is the professional body representing architects in Finland.

Overview

The Association

SAFA is a non-profit, professional organization open to all architects with a university degree from a Finnish university or equivalent qualification from another country. SAFA has 2906 members (61% male and 39% female). This accounts for approx 80% of all Finnish architects with a university degree. Membership is voluntary, and is not a condition for practising in the profession. In Finland no registration is required. SAFA has also 743 student members.

SAFA Activities

The primary aim of all SAFA activities is to promote the quality of the built environment. At the national level, SAFA endeavours to influence legislation by presenting SAFA opinion in the form of statements and conducting discussions with politicians and various public authorities. Together with other organizations in the building sector, SAFA has defined the scope of work for architectural design. To ensure the interests of both clients and architects, SAFA monitors and provides information about architectural fees. It also supervises professional standards and ethics among its members.

Executive Board

At its annual autumn meeting, the Delegates Council appoints the SAFA Executive Board, which consists of 10 members. The Chairman of the Executive Board is called the Chairman of the Association and the Board’s 2 vice-chairmen are both called Vice-Chairman of the Association. The Board has created committees and workgroups to aid in its tasks.

Membership

Finnish citizens who have a degree in architecture from a Finnish university or an equivalent professional qualification are eligible for SAFA membership. Citizens of other Nordic countries are further required to be permanent residents in Finland and working in the field of architecture. Architects from elsewhere outside the Nordic countries must furthermore have lived in Finland for at least 2 years and know sufficient Finnish or Swedish in order to be able to adhere to the SAFA rules and the guidelines issued to members.

People with a degree in architecture from elsewhere than Finland must include a report on their studies when applying for SAFA membership. Usually a printout of the contents of the person’s studies or similar is acceptable.

Benefits of Membership

SAFA deals with questions related to benefits in the job market via AKAVA (A confederation of trade unions for academic professionals). The SAFA Permanent Committee for Employment Issues is responsible for practical labour-market issues concerning both those working in architects’ offices as well as those in the public sector. The Employment Issues' Committee also keeps contacts with the Finnish Association of Graduate Engineers TEK, with which it has a cooperation agreement.

For questions regarding agreements and the setting of fees within the private sector, SAFA has a Board Committee for Professional Practice, which on behalf of clients or SAFA members issues expert statements regarding the content of assignment agreements, and the validity of the architect’s fees.

The Board Committee for Education and Research monitors social and other professionally related changes influencing the architect’s basic, post-graduate and continuing education. This committee also prepares proposals, initiatives and statements.

With its long traditions, the Permanent Committee for Collegial Issues, appointed by the Association Council, deals with issues of collegiality between members and norms concerning the architects’ ethics.

297,18892284,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle%20of%20Life,Circle of Life,"""Circle of Life"" is a song from The Walt Disney Company 1994 animated film The Lion King. Composed by Elton John, with lyrics by Tim Rice, the song was performed by Carmen Twillie (the deep female lead vocals) and Lebo M. (opening vocals in Zulu) as the film's opening song. In an interview, Rice said he was amazed at the speed with which John composed: ""I gave him the lyrics at the beginning of the session at about two in the afternoon. By half-past three, he'd finished writing and recording a stunning demo."" Elton John sang a pop version (with alternative lyrics) of the song with the London Community Gospel Choir, which was included in the film's soundtrack and made into a music video.

""Circle of Life"" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1994, along with two other songs from The Lion King: ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"", the latter of which won the award. ""Circle of Life"" was also nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy. The song reached No. 11 in the UK and No. 18 in the US and is featured frequently in attractions based on The Lion King, such as Disney theme parks and parades. Michael Crawford sang it as part of a medley for The Disney Album in 2001.

The song was featured in Disney's 2019 photorealistic computer-animated remake of The Lion King and was used in the first trailer of the film, a near shot-for-shot remake of the opening of the original animated film. This new version of the song was performed by Brown Lindiwe Mkhize, the actress who performed as Rafiki in the stage adaptation of the movie in London from 2005 to 2018. However, the new version also retains the original Zulu opening vocals by Lebo M. from the 1994 film.

Live performances
John began to perform this one replacing Can You Feel the Love Tonight in some of his concerts, shows and performances from 1999 to 2018.

Theatrical version

Act I 
In the theatrical adaptation, the opening sequence is noticeably different from the opening of the film. For example, the song is sung by Rafiki instead of an off-screen female narrator.

With the sun rising over the Pride Lands, Rafiki commences the start of the production by singing the opening chant of the song and summoning the animals of the Pride Lands for the presentation of baby Simba. As the first two verses of the musical number end, a representation of Pride Rock appears on stage carrying its two reigning rulers, Sarabi cradling the small puppet representing her son in her arms with Mufasa alongside her. As the choir chants excitedly in the background, Rafiki accompanies the monarch and his consort to the top of Pride Rock to bless the cub before raising him high in the air, singing joyfully alongside the chorus as the gathered animals bow before their new prince.

Act II 
At the end of Act II, Simba's friends and family acknowledge him as the rightful king after Scar's defeat. Rafiki crowns Simba with the mantle of kingship after his victory and Simba ascends Pride Rock. There he gives a mighty roar which echoes across the whole kingdom, and the animals come back to the Pride Lands to recognise and salute Simba as the rightful king. The musical ends as Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to all of the animals, followed by a blackout that finishes Act II and leads to the curtain call at the end of the performance.
 
The assembly of animals that appear are slightly different from the beginning of Act I. There are no wildebeests or adult elephant, only two zebras instead of three, nine gazelles instead of twelve, and half of the bird performers instead of four. Only the baby elephant, the rhino, the giraffes, three cranes, the cheetah, and the birds appear as poles on cranes as kites.

Other versions
The song was re-recorded in 2003 by the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, a group of actors and actresses who have appeared in Disney Channel television series and original movies, for the album Disneymania 2.  The line-up was significantly different when their next rerecording, ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"", was released two years later.

In 2017 American boyband 98° recorded a cover version of the song to help promote a re-release of The Lion King on Blu-ray as part of the Disney Signature Collection. 
The single was released as a digital download on 22 September 2017.

The song was remixed by Mat Zo which was released in the album Dconstructed on 22 April 2014.

Critical reception
Music writer James Masterton commented in his weekly UK chart commentary, ""Sad to relate though it is another rather unimpressive Elton John ballad, unable to stand comparison with much of his classic output and is worryingly close in places to The One - arguably the last single of any value he put out."" Alan Jones from Music Week noted, ""Elton is in philosophical mood here and has a slightly continental flavour. Publicity for The Lion King movie from which the single is taken should push it into the Top 20.""

Music video
The music video for ""Circle of Life"" was directed by American film composer, producer and film director Richard Baskin. It was published on YouTube in November 2017. The video has amassed over 13 million views as of November 2021.

Opening of song
The song is well known for its opening line, sung by South African composer Lebo M. in Zulu. Due to the difficulty to pronounce the lyrics for English speakers, they are often mispronounced. The Zulu version of the lyrics are: 
 
Nants ingonyama bagithi baba 
Sithi uhm ingonyama
Nants ingonyama bagithi baba
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama
Ingonyama siyo nqoba
Ingonyama
Ingonyama nengw enamabala

Which translates to English as:
Here comes a lion, father
Oh yes it’s a lion
Here comes a lion, father
Oh yes it’s a lion
A lion we’re going to conquer
A lion
A lion and a leopard come to this open place

In popular culture
 
Due to the film's universal impact on pop culture, the song is often referenced in other media.

""Circle of Life"" was referenced in the song ""Colors of the Wind"" which was composed by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz for Disney's 33rd animated motion picture Pocahontas. The song's lyrics are about animism and respecting nature.

In one of Disney's many self-references, ""The Circle of Life"" appeared as a false beginning of the film Chicken Little, when Buck was trying to open the movie.

It is currently the main theme song for Disney's Animal Kingdom at the Walt Disney World. Epcot featured a cinema-type film called Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable from 1995 to 2018, with Timon, Pumbaa, and Simba discussing environmental topics.

At the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association, President Barack Obama jokingly claimed he was going to show his ""long-form birth video"", spoofing Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories that alleged he was born outside of the United States, rather than in his actual birthplace of Honolulu, Hawaii. The opening chant was played from the film, and Simba was seen being lifted to the skies.

New York Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes started using the song as his walk-up music during the 2016 Major League Baseball season.

Houston Astros outfielder Michael Brantley began using the song as his walk up music after the All Star Break in the 2019 Major League Baseball season, debuting the song in what turned out to be a multi-HR game for him.

He was a member of the Labor Party (ALP).

Early life
Mallam was born at Backwater near Glen Innes, New South Wales and was the son of a farmer.  He was educated to elementary level at numerous state schools in the North Coast region of New South Wales. At the age of 12 he left school and worked on  dairy farms, he was also employed as a shearer, drover, storekeeper and bus driver. He eventually became a taxi and bus service owner in Hurstville and Earlwood and ran a ferry service on Port Hacking. He was a long-term member of the Transport Workers Union and joined the Labor Party in 1926. Between 1946 and 1976 he was an editorial assistant on Jack Lang's paper, The Century.

State politics
Mallam was the unsuccessful Labor candidate for the seat of Burwood at the 1944 state election, and the 1951 Burwood by-election caused by the death of the sitting Liberal member Gordon Jackett. He was eventually elected to parliament as the member for Dulwich Hill at the 1953 Dulwich Hill by-election caused by the resignation of the sitting Labor member George Weir who had accepted a position as a judge on the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales. Mallam retained the seat at the next 4 elections, until it was abolished by a redistribution at the 1968 election. He did not contest that election but won Labor endorsement for the new  seat of Cook at the 1969 federal election. He was defeated by the Liberal's Don Dobie. In 1971, Mallam was selected by the Labor Party for the seat of Campbelltown which was physically and demographically far removed from his previous seat. At the election he defeated the sitting Liberal member Max Dunbier. He retained the seat at the next 3 elections and retired from public life at the election in 1981 . Mallam did not hold party, parliamentary or ministerial office but had a reputation for being a very hard working local member.

311,16084413,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcha%20Safo,Balcha Safo,"Dejazmach Balcha Safo  (1863 – 6 November 1936), popularly referred to by his horse-name Balcha Aba Nefso, was an Ethiopian military commander and lord protector of the crown, who served in both the First and Second Italo-Ethiopian Wars.

Originally of humble birth from South West Shewa he was made a dejazmach. Balcha also became a provincial Governor (Shum), and was a renowned warrior under Emperor Menelik II, famously becoming one of the leaders in the Battle of Adwa. He later eventually became a key member of the conservative provincial elite who, in the 1920s, were often at odds with the modernising reforms and rising power of the Regent, Ras Tafari Makonnen (later Emperor Haile Selassie I). Tafari would force Dejazmach Balcha into retirement, albeit an honourable one, in 1928, from which he would emerge in 1935 to fight the Fascist invaders during which he was killed in 1936.

Biography

Early career
Balcha was born to an Oromo father and Gurage mother in Shewa Zone. He came to the notice of Emperor Menelik II, who brought him back to Addis Ababa where he was educated. 
He distinguished himself at the imperial court and showed particular skill in military exercises and theory. He made his reputation, according to oral tradition, in the Battle of Mek'ele, and later at the Battle of Adwa (March 1, 1896), and was rewarded with elevation to the aristocratic status of dejazmach.

From 1898 to 1908, Balcha was Shum/Governor of Sidamo province.  After the death of Dejazmach Yilma Mekonen in 1907, he became the Shum/Governor of Harar from 1910 to 1914. From 1917 to 1928, he again served as Shum/Governor of Sidamo.

Conflict with Haile Selassie
A conservative who had been loyal to the memory of the deceased Emperor Menelik, Balcha was one of the leading nobles who challenged the growing power of the regent Ras Tafari (who later became Emperor Haile Selassie). A blunt old warrior, he did not trust the young Emperor, who was an advocate for modernizing Ethiopia. In a deft political maneuver, which has since been seen as an example of Haile Selassie's genius, in 1928 the Emperor invited Balcha to the capital for a feast in Balcha's honor. Balcha arrived 11 February with several thousand men, and camped right outside of Addis Ababa at an area called Nifas Silk, and spent the evening ""generally insolent and threatening in conversation."" Ras Tafari was nervous in private. The Empress begged Balcha by the name of her late father Emperor Menelik II.

Meanwhile, the regent sent Ras Kassa Haile Darge to Balcha's camp, where he lied to the troops stating that Balcha and Regent Ras Tafari were in agreement, and paid the soldiers Balcha had left there. At the same time the Emperor appointed Dejazmach Birru Wolde Gabriel to replace Balcha as governor of Sidamo. These simultaneous acts deprived Balcha of his ability to resist, a loss he discovered only after he returned to the camp. Balcha promised a peaceful transition to the empress and lay down his sword, which was the traditional way of giving up his power in respect of the Empress.

Death
When Italy invaded in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Balcha Safo came out of retirement to fight against the Italians. Major Mesfin Seleshi, an agent of the imperial government in exile who was coordinating resistance in occupied Ethiopia, writes of his fate in a letter to Haile Selassie I thus:

The enemy went as far as Sodo Gurage land, where his Excellency Dejazmatch Balcha lives, and campaigned against him. The people betrayed him, and all his men were annihilated. He and two of his servants, three people all together, were surrounded. A white man came to him and asked, are you Dejazmatch Balcha? When he said 'Yes I am', the white man said 'Surrender your arms, and untie your pistol belt'. Dejazmatch Balcha said, 'I am not here to surrender my arms', and he killed the white man; then, he and his two servants died instantly without having much suffering.

312,47570673,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%20China%20Victory%20Day%20Parade,2015 China Victory Day Parade,"The 2015 China Victory Day parade was a military parade held along Changan Avenue, Beijing, on 3 September 2015 to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day of World War II. The commemoration was the first high-profile military parade held to celebrate an occasion other than the National Day of the People's Republic of China. 12,000 troops of the People's Liberation Army participated in the parade, in addition to over 1,000 troops from 17 different countries, and about 850,000 ""Citizen Guards"" were mobilised to guard the city. Xi Jinping inspected the troops, Premier Li Keqiang was the master of ceremonies and Song Puxuan was the chief commander of the parade.

Background 

The 70th Anniversary of V-day parade marked the first time that China held a military parade other than the National Day, and the first to celebrate the end of World War II. Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, China held parades primarily on October 1, the country's national day. The most prominent renditions of the parade were held in 1959, 1984, 1999, and 2009, presided over respectively by then leaders Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. The 70th anniversary parade was also the first major parade since Xi Jinping took power as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (China's paramount leader) in 2012. The prevailing theme was to be ""peace and victory"". Xi Jinping had attended the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade in May as the guest-of-honour of Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Putin returned the favour at this parade.

Preparations and restrictions 
National leadership placed considerable importance on being able to put the best foot forward and do away with distractions. Bloomberg reported that the central government once again intervened in the stock market to ensure stability ahead of the anniversary; there were traffic curfews and closures of public facilities including seven parks and some hospitals. Line 1, Beijing Subway, which passes underneath Changan Avenue, was shut down; 256 bus-lines in Beijing were placed under tight transport restrictions from September 2–4. On the day of the parade, hospitals restricted most of their activities beyond emergencies, the stock markets were closed. Areas in the city centre were placed under martial law, and 850,000 ""citizen guards"" were deployed to ensure security within the city. The city authorities sent in trained macaques and falcons to make sure the skies over central Beijing were free of birds that would put the flypast at risk. The trained macaque monkeys climbed trees and dismantled birds nests in advance of the parade. Hot air balloons and hang gliders were equally barred from the city; those residing along Changan Avenue were forbidden from opening their windows during the lock-down period. Domestic satellite televisions were restricted from playing entertainment programs between September 1–5. China Central Television ceased the broadcasting of all entertainment programming, only playing films and TV series about the Second World War. Xi Jinping decreed the creation of two new public holidays targeted at Japan, the first being September 3 - Victory over Japan Day, officially named The 70th anniversary of Chinese People's Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War Victory Commemoration Day. The second one was declared for December 13, marking the Japanese takeover of Nanjing, China's then capital under the Nationalists and the Nanking Massacre that followed, which resulted in many Chinese deaths by Japanese military personnel garrisoned in the city. The CY Leung administration in Hong Kong argued for a holiday to facilitate participation in commemorative events, thus it tabled the ""Special Holiday (3 September 2015) Ordinance"" – designating the day as a one-off holiday – for debate in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) in July. The act passed despite strong resistance and more than 90 amendments from one legislator.

To reduce air pollution and ensure blue skies for the parade, half of Beijing's cars were barred from the streets and nearly 10,000 industrial firms in Beijing and in areas near and far – Hebei, Tianjin, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shandong and Henan – suspended or cut production starting on August 20 to cut down on emissions. The factory shut-downs and road closures gave rise to rare instance of clean air, where PM2.5 measurements were below 50, and the lack of traffic jams, and these were welcomed by residents of the capital. Observers noted that the umbrella, which became iconic in Hong Kong during the protests in 2014, were nowhere to be seen despite the blazing heat although commonly used as a shield against the sun in China.

Leaders in attendance

Chinese leaders
Xi Jinping, who holds the posts for the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, President of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, was the central figure of the day's events.  Premier Li Keqiang was the master of ceremonies for the parade, breaking convention from its two previous renditions of the parade, which were both hosted by the Communist Party Secretary of Beijing (Jia Qinglin in 1999 and Liu Qi in 2009). General Song Puxuan, Commander of the Northern Theater Command, greeted Xi in front of Tiananmen at the start of the parade during the inspection segment, declaring the readiness of the troops for the marchpast.

Atop Tiananmen, Xi Jinping wore a Mao suit, as was customary for leaders inspecting troops at military parades; his wife Peng Liyuan wore a red dress. The remaining political figures wore business suits. Xi delivered the keynote address at the parade with an unexpected announcement of a plan to cut 300,000 personnel from the Chinese military. The other members of the Politburo Standing Committee, Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan, and Zhang Gaoli, watched the parade on top of Tiananmen Gate.

Former paramount leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao; former Premiers Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao; and other former senior leaders Li Ruihuan, Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Li Lanqing, Song Ping, Zeng Qinghong, Wu Guanzheng, Li Changchun, Luo Gan, and He Guoqiang, also attended the parade at Tiananmen. This meant that all former members of the Standing Committee who were in good standing with the party and alive at the time of the parade attended the event; they sat in strict protocol sequence to the right of the members of the incumbent Politburo Standing Committee.

Hong Kong Special Administration Region chief executive Leung Chun-ying also led a 300-person group at the parade, and Macau Chief Executive Fernando Chui also attended.

List of dignitaries in attendance

The following countries sent their former leaders to the parade :
  Former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany.
  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom.
  Former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan.
  Former President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines. Estrada attended the parade, not as a representative of his country but as part of his duties as Mayor of Manila. Estrada cited the fact that Manila and Beijing were sister cities as his reason for attending the event.
  Former Captain Regent Gianfranco Terenzi of San Marino.
  Former Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng of Singapore
  Former Vice President and Premier Lien Chan of the Republic of China (Taiwan)
  Former President José Ramos-Horta of East Timor

Leaders of the following international organizations were in attendance:
  Director-General Irina Bokova of the UNESCO
  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations.
  President Peter Maurer of the International Committee of the Red Cross

In addition, many embassies around Beijing also sent their defense attaches and military generals to attend the parade.

Criticisms 
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, President Ma Ying-jeou and his Kuomintang objected to the event and what they see as the Communist Party usurping credit for leading the Chinese defence against Japan during World War II. However, former Chairman of the Kuomintang Lien Chan also attended the parade, ostensibly in his personal capacity, sparking controversy at home. Whilst Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the Taiwanese opposition, criticised Lian for failing to represent the views of the majority of Taiwanese, observers noted that Lien had considerable business interests on the mainland he sought to protect, likewise the Kuomintang also had interests on the mainland. Hong Kong commentator Frank Ching added that Lien Chan's presence at the ceremony undermined the KMT, as China appeared to erase the role of the Nationalists in defending China.

Other pundits said that the main object of the parade was to rewrite history and elevate the Communist Party's position in ending the war.

Kyodo News Agency cited a US department of State spokesman that United States objected the President of Sudan Bashir to attend the parade in the news conference held on August 31, 2015. He stated that China should consider about the international society's worry as a UN security council member with inviting or assisting someone who is wanted under the document of warrant signed by ICC.

Parade groups 
Some 12,000 troops marched along Changan Avenue up to Tiananmen for inspection by President Xi Jinping and the two living former leaders. There were 10 squads: 9 from the People's Liberation Army and 1 from the People's Armed Police). Each squad had 350 soldiers excluding the color guards, and were led by two major generals or lieutenant generals in active service. In total, 56 generals participated in the event. The military vehicle contingent were led by two Air Force lieutenant generals,  a vice admiral and a lieutenant general of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force: Tian Zhong, deputy commander of the PLA Navy, Chen Dong, deputy commander of the PLA Air Force,  Wu Guohua, deputy commander of the PLA Rocket Force. Zheng Qunliang another deputy commander of the Air Force, commanded the squadron of jet fighters in the air. This was the first time in PRC's history that military parade contingents were led by officers ranked as high as lieutenant general.

Veterans 
Surviving soldiers from the Second World War joined the parade for the first time. They had fought under various commands, including the New Fourth Army, the National Revolutionary Army, and the Eighth Route Army, with most over 90 years old then. Some of the passed soldiers' widows marched in place of their husbands. Besides Chinese soldiers, some surviving airmen of United States Air Force who had fought alongside Chinese forces also joined the veterans column. The veterans rode in open-top buses at the start of the parade and were escorted by the People's Armed Police Motorcycle Escort Squadron.

Marchpast columns

Military bands in attendance
A 1,000 piece band was present to provide musical accompaniment to the parade. The bands were organized as follows:

Color party 
The color guard consisted of 207 men and women from the PLA Honor Guard Battalion, who escorted the national military colours. This marked the first occasion of female service personnel forming part of the honor guard during a national parade. Their first public presentation occurred during the state visit of the President of Turkmenistan to Beijing in May 2015, utilizing the Type 56 ceremonial rifle.

Representative companies from CPC units of the Second Sino-Japanese War 
The CPC's hero squads consisted of detachments that traced their lineage to units that participated in the war against Japan, which included the ""Five Heroes of Langya Mountain"" (狼牙山五壮士), ""Battle of Pingxingguan Hero Squad"", and the ""Hundred Regiments Offensive Hero Squad"". Representative detachments from each Chinese military region participated in the parade, led by soldiers carrying standards used by the predecessor units.

These represented the following CPC formations during the war against Japan:

 Eighth Route Army
 New Fourth Army
 Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army
 Southern China guerrilla organizations under CPC control

People's Armed Police 
A detachment of the People's Armed Police also participated in the parade, the unit having previously been part of the PLA. The unit's lineage, through the 114th Division of the 38th Army, can also be traced to regiments that fought during the war.

Foreign contingents 

Groups from 17 countries were sent to take part in the military parade. Marching in alphabetical order these were:

China's Ministry of National Defence spokesman Yang Yujun said that the cuts to the size of the military would include personnel not trained for battle.

According to his opinion, China will modify the 'command system' by simplifying its management structure. China's one-star general Xu Guangyu also said that the China's People's Armed Police will be reformed appropriately.

For historical reasons, China's military structure emphasizes the army and land forces.

Biography

Zylberberg was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. With the National team, he made his debut in 1997 and competed for his native country at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2004 Summer Olympics. After a short spell at Dutch club Hurley, he played at Atlético San Sebastián, in Spain.

Special participation on television
In May 2012, a television advertisement emerged by made by Young & Rubicam, an American advertisement agency owned by the British agency WPP plc and made on behalf of the Argentine Presidency, entitled Olympic Games 2012: Homage to the Fallen and the Veterans of the Malvinas, featured Zylberberg training in the Falkland Islands.
 
The video features Zylberberg outside the Globe Tavern, doing dips on benches, then running past a British red telephone box. He then carries out step-ups on the islands' Great War Memorial honouring British sailors who died battling the German fleet in 1914, and finally ends with the quote """" (""To compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil.""). Zylberberg entered the Falkland Islands on the pretext that he would be taking part in a marathon on the island. Zylberberg stated that his feature in the video conveys his country's feelings over the islands, stating ""The message is that to every Argentine the islands belong to Argentina. To me to be training in any other province or to do it over the islands is the same,"". The clip was first aired on May 2, the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano,
involving the death of 323 troops, nearly half of Argentina's total 649 losses during the Falklands conflict.

The advert drew protest from the Falkland Islands government, the British Government and within Argentina, both for the film's political aspects, and also that Zylberberg climbed over a British World War I war memorial. On 4 May 2012, the advertising agency responsible issued a public apology.  The International Olympic Committee criticised Argentina, stating that the Olympic games should not be used as a forum to raise political issues. The president of the Argentine Olympic Committee, Gerardo Werthein issued a statement: ""Using the Olympic Games to make political gestures of any kind is not acceptable and we will conduct ourselves in the proper spirit of Olympism in all that we do in London and elsewhere"".

It was revealed on May 9 that Zylberberg was to be dropped from the final Olympic warm-up event before the Olympic games and as a result, miss the games altogether. His absence from the squad was attributed by his coach, Pablo Rossi, to ""sporting reasons,"" and that Zylberberg ""had not been able to complete all the necessary steps in pre-season"". However there is speculation that Zylberberg was dropped to avoid adverse attention to the team and potential media frenzy when players land in London in July 2012. As a result of his involvement with the advertisement, Zylberberg was also the subject of online threats.

With compatible users, they do not suffer side effects and are able to use two Genomixes.

325,3148904,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%20v%20Brown,R v Brown,"is a House of Lords judgment which re-affirmed the conviction of five men for their involvement in consensual unusually severe sadomasochistic sexual acts over a 10-year period.  They were convicted of a count of unlawful and malicious wounding and a count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (contrary to sections 20 and 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861). The key issue facing the Court was whether consent was a valid defence to assault in these circumstances, to which the Court answered in the negative. The acts involved included the nailing of a part of the body to a board, but not so as to necessitate, strictly, medical treatment.

The court found no direct precedent for sadomasochism among the senior courts (those of binding precedent) so applied the reasoning of three indirectly analogous binding cases and others.

The case is colloquially known as the Spanner case, named after Operation Spanner, the investigation which led to it.

Facts 
The five appellants engaged in sadomasochistic sexual acts, consenting to the harm which they received; whilst their conviction also covered alike harm against others, they sought as a minimum to have their mutually consented acts to be viewed as lawful. None of the five men complained of any of the acts in which they were involved, which were uncovered by an unrelated police investigation. The physical severity was not disputed. Each appellant (having had legal advice) pleaded guilty to the offence when the trial judge ruled that consent of the victim was no defence. 

The question approved and certified as in the public interest on appeal was whether the prosecution had to prove (in all similar cases) a lack of consent on the recipient's part. The appellants argued against conviction under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 as they had in all instances consented to the acts they engaged in (volenti non fit injuria), that as with tattooing and customary-site body piercings their consent would be directly analogous to the lawful exceptions laid out by three cornerstone (and other) widely-spaced precedent cases.

Judgment 
The certified question of appeal which the House of Lords was asked to consider was:
Where A wounds or assaults B occasioning him actual bodily harm (ABH) in the course of a sado-masochistic encounter, does the prosecution have to prove lack of consent on the part of B before they can establish A's guilt under section 20 or section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861?

The Lords – by a bare majority, two out of five dissenting – answered this in the negative, holding that consent could not be a defence to these (typically overlapping) offences.

Lord Templeman stated:
It is not clear to me that the activities of the appellants were exercises of rights in respect of private and family life. But assuming that the appellants are claiming to exercise those rights I do not consider that Article 8 invalidates a law which forbids violence which is intentionally harmful to body and mind. Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing. Cruelty is uncivilised. I would answer the certified question in the negative and dismiss the appeals of the appellants against conviction.

His judgment examined the acts to be ""unpredictably dangerous and degrading to body and mind and were developed
with increasing barbarity and taught to persons whose consents were dubious or worthless"".

Lord Jauncey stated:
Before examining these cases it is interesting to look at the definitions of ""Maim"" and ""Assault"" in Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, 8th ed. (1824), Book 1 in Chapter 15. Maiming is defined, at p. 107, Sect. 1, as ""... such a hurt of any part of a man's body whereby he is rendered less able, in fighting, either to defend himself or to annoy his adversary . . . . "" Examples are then given. Assault is defined, at p. 110, Sect. 1, as ""... an attempt to offer, with force and violence, to do a corporal hurt to another"" and battery (Sect. 2) as ""... any injury whatsoever be it never so small, being actually done to the person of a man in an angry, revengeful, rude, or insolent manner...""

...the conclusion from each of them is clear, namely, that the infliction of bodily harm without  good reason is unlawful and that the consent of the victim is irrelevant. In the unreported case of Reg. v. Boyea (28 January 1992), in which the appellant was convicted of indecent assault on a woman, Glidewell L.J. giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) said:

""The central proposition in Donovan [1934] is in our view consistent with the decision of the court in the Attorney General's Reference (No. 6 of 1980) [1981]. That proposition can be expressed as follows: an assault intended or which is likely to cause bodily harm, accompanied by indecency, is an offence irrespective of consent, provided that the injury is not 'transient or trifling'.""

...

I prefer the reasoning of Cave J. in Coney and of the Court of Appeal in the later three English cases which I consider to have been correctly
decided. In my view the line properly falls to be drawn between assault at common law and the offence of assault occasioning [ABH] created
by section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, with the result that consent of the victim is no answer to anyone charged with the latter
offence or with a contravention of section 20 unless the circumstances fall within one of the well known exceptions such as organised sporting contests
and games, parental chastisement or reasonable surgery.

Furthermore, the possibility of proselytisation and corruption of young men is a real danger even in the case of these appellants and the taking of video
recordings of such activities suggest that secrecy may not be as strict as the appellants claimed to your Lordships. If the only purpose of the activity is the
sexual gratification of one or both of the participants what then is the need of a video recording?

My Lords I have no doubt that it would not be in the public interest that deliberate infliction of [ABH] during the course of homosexual sado-masochistic activities should be held to be lawful...If it is to be decided that such activities as the nailing by A of B's foreskin or scrotum to a board or the insertion of hot wax into C's urethra followed by the burning of his penis with a candle or the incising of D's scrotum with a scalpel to the effusion of blood are injurious neither to B, C and D nor to the public interest then it is for Parliament with its accumulated wisdom and sources of information to declare them to be lawful.

Lord Lowry stated:
The disagreement concerns offences which occasion actual bodily harm.

...

In the immediately following paragraph of his judgment the Lord Chief Justice [court below us] shows that what he said in Attorney General's Reference (No. 6 of 1980) was intended by him to be of general application...

If, as I, too, consider, the question of consent is immaterial, there are prima facie offences against sections 20 and 47 and the next question is
whether there is good reason to add sado-masochistic acts to the list of exceptions contemplated in Attorney-General's Reference. In my opinion, the
answer to that question is ""No"".

In adopting this conclusion I follow closely my noble and learned friends Lord Templeman and Lord Jauncey. What the appellants are obliged to propose is that the deliberate and painful infliction of physical injury should be exempted from the operation of statutory provisions the object of which is to prevent or punish that very thing, the reason for the proposed exemption being that both those who will inflict and those who will suffer the injury wish to satisfy a perverted and depraved sexual desire. Sado-masochistic homosexual activity cannot be regarded as conducive to the enhancement or enjoyment of family life or conducive to the welfare of society. A relaxation of the prohibitions in sections 20 and 47 can only encourage the practice of homosexual sado-masochism and the physical cruelty that it must involve (which can scarcely be regarded as a ""manly diversion"") by withdrawing the legal penalty and giving the activity a judicial imprimatur. As well as all this, one cannot overlook the physical danger to those who may indulge in sado-masochism. In this connection, and also generally, it is idle for the appellants to claim that they are educated exponents of ""civilised cruelty"".

As your Lordships have observed, the appellants have sought to fortify their argument by reference to the European Convention on Human Rights. On the view which I have taken, Article 7 has no relevance since the question of retrospective legislation or a retrospective judicial decision does not arise.

Article 8.1 of the Convention states that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. The attempts to rely on this article is another example of the appellants' reversal of the onus of proof of legality, which disregards the effect of sections 20 and 47. I would only say, in the first, place, that article 8 is not part of our law. Secondly, there has been no legislation which, being post-Convention and
ambiguous, falls to be construed so as to conform with the Convention rather than to contradict it. And thirdly, if one is looking at article 8.2, no public
authority can be said to have interfered with a right (to indulge in sado-masochism) by enforcing the provisions of the 1861 Act. If, as appears to be the fact, sado-masochistic acts inevitably involve the occasioning of at least [ABH], there cannot be a right under our law to indulge in them.

Dissents 
Lord Mustill preferred consensual, private, sexual acts, up to and including involving ABH, to be outside of criminality:
In my opinion it should be a case about the criminal law of private sexual relations, if about anything at all ... [leaving aside] repugnance and moral objection, both of which are entirely natural but neither of which are, in my opinion, grounds upon which the court could properly create a new crime.

Lord Slynn agreed:
 As Goff L.J. put it in Collins v. Wilcock [1984] 1 W.L.R. 1172, 1177: ""Generally speaking, consent is a defence to battery."" As the word ""generally"" suggests the exception was itself subject to exceptions. Thus in Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law it is stated in article 206
""Everyone has a right to consent to the infliction upon himself of bodily harm not amounting to a maim"". By way of footnote it is explained that ""Injuries
short of maims are not criminal at common law unless they are assaults, but an assault is inconsistent with consent"". Maim could not be the subject matter
of consent since it rendered a man less able to fight or defend himself. (Hawkins Pleas of the Crown, 8th ed., Book 1, p. 107). Nor could a person
consent to the infliction of death [the next article of the digest] or to an infliction of bodily harm in such manner as to amount to a breach of the
peace (article 208).

The law has recognised cases...where consent can be a defence...surgical operations, sports, the chastisement of children, jostling in a crowd, but all subject to a reasonable degree of force being used, tattooing and earpiercing; the latter [not a defence] include death and maiming. None of these situations, in most cases pragmatically accepted, either covers or is analogous to the facts of the present case. It is, however, suggested that the answer to the question certified flows from the decisions in three cases...R. v. Coney (1882)...the injuries given and received in prize-
fights are injurious to the public...Rex. v. Donovan [1934]...was accepted to be an issue for the jury as to whether the prosecution had proved that the girl had not consented and whether the consent was immaterial...Attorney General's Reference (No. 6 of 1980) [1981] two youths fought...argument...consent is no defence ""where people...try to cause...or cause each other bodily harm for no good reason.""

It seems to me that the notion of ""consent"" fits ill into the situation where there is a fight. 

Three propositions seem to me to be clear.

It is "". . . inherent in the conception of assault and battery that the victim does not consent"" (Glanville Williams [1962] Grim. L.R. 74, 75).

Secondly, consent must be full and free and must be as to the actual level of force used or pain inflicted. Thirdly, there exist areas where the law disregards the victim's consent even where that consent is freely and fully given. These areas may relate to the person (e.g. a child); they may relate to the place (e.g. in public); they may relate to the nature of the harm done. It is the latter which is in issue in the present case.

...

If a line has to be drawn, as I think it must, to be workable, it cannot be allowed to fluctuate within particular charges and in the interests of legal
certainty it has to be accepted that consent can be given to acts which are said to constitute [ABH] and wounding.

...

My conclusion is thus that as the law stands, adults can consent to acts done in private which do not result in serious bodily harm...[Here]...it must be proved by the prosecution that the person to whom the act was done did not consent to it. Accordingly I consider that these appeals should be allowed and the conviction set aside.

Criticism 
Legal journals and textbooks of the 21st century tend towards criticism of the majority's analysis and overtones. Baker writes: ""The sadomasochists might argue that the telos of the participants' activities in sadomasochism is merely to achieve sexual gratification. But every time they want to achieve the ulterior aim of sexual gratification, they need to harm each other. The harm has to be repeated each time the recipient wants to receive sadomasochistic pleasure. The two are inseparable—the sexual gratification can only be achieved while the harm is being inflicted. Per contra, adornment procedures only involve a one-off wounding, burning, etc., which results in a long-term benefit. There is nothing unreasonable about preventing people from repeatedly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon others, merely because they want to repeat the ephemeral sexual thrill it gives them. Nonetheless, it seems that this argument should not apply to [ABH]. Those who regularly inflict [ABH] on themselves by smoking and drinking excessively are not criminalized, nor are those who supply them with the instruments of harm. Similarly, professional athletes regularly subject their bodies to [ABH], but recover."" Marianne Giles calls the judgment ""paternalism of an unelected, unrepresentative group who use but fail to acknowledge that power"".

Two years later Baker argued ""that an application of the harm principle to many forms of nontherapeutic cosmetic surgery shows that these procedures are a form of physical harm, not a form of medicine, and therefore ought to be criminalized. Not only does the harm principle support the case for criminalization, but so too do the relevant precedents. This article focuses on the general moral justifications (wrongful harm to others) for criminalizing unnecessary harmful cosmetic surgery, but legal doctrine is also invoked to demonstrate that there is a legal justification for criminalization. The famous English case of R. v. Brown will be discussed to outline the core legal case for criminalization. This article does not aim to provide a comparative study of the U.S. and English authorities, but rather aims to make theoretical arguments for criminalization, and thus, works from the legal premise that in most states the U.S. courts have taken a similar position to that taken in the seminal English House of Lords decision in R. v. Brown.""

Social impact 
Opposition to the judgment (in both consecutive appeals) legally focusses on the dissenting two final judges and the contrasting R v Wilson whereby a husband painfully branded his initials on his wife's buttocks at her request. Fears of bias due to heteronormativity were allayed in R v Emmett, whereby the lower court of binding precedent, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, held the same rules apply to heterosexual participants in such acts.

Citing R v Brown, law professors Fox and Thomson (2005) argue against non-therapeutic circumcision of boys, to the audience of medical professionals.

327,32498575,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29,28th Army (Soviet Union),"The 28th Army was a field army of the Red Army and the Soviet Ground Forces, formed three times in 1941–42 and active during the postwar period for many years in the Belorussian Military District.

Initial formation 
The army was formed first in June 1941 from the Arkhangelsk Military District. It included the 30th and 33rd Rifle Corps, 69th Motorised Division, artillery and several other units.
The Army Commander was Lieutenant General Vladimir Kachalov (previously commander of the Arkhangelsk Military District). Members of the army's Military Council were Brigade Commissioner Vasily T. Kolesnikov, and Army Chief of Staff Major General Pavel G. Egorov.

On 14 July 1941, the order creating the Reserve Front gave the 28th Army's composition as nine divisions, one gun, one howitzer, and four corps artillery regiments, and four anti-tank artillery regiments.

It participated in the Battle of Smolensk. The army was encircled in the Smolensk Pocket and destroyed. Army headquarters was disbanded on 10 August. Subordinate units that broke out were used to form the Reserve Front, along with units from other armies.

General Kachalov was killed by artillery fire on 4 August 1941 during the breakout from the encirclement. He was buried in the village of Stodolische, Pochinkovsky District, Smolensk Oblast. Lacking accurate information regarding his death, Stalin allowed him to be named as a traitor and sentenced to death in absentia in accordance with Order № 270. Only on 23 December 1953, well after the war ended, did the Supreme Court overturn the order.

Second and third formations
The army was subsequently reformed again in November 1941 and September 1942. The third formation began on 9 September, from forces assigned to the Stalingrad Military District and Southeastern Front, and was tasked with defending the port city of Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea's northern coast, as well as the lower reaches of the Volga. The army was under the command of Lt. Gen. Vasyl Herasymenko, with Corps Commissar A.N. Melnikov and chief of staff Mjr. Gen. S.M. Rogachevsky making up the rest of the army's Military Council. On its formation it was under the direct command of the STAVKA, but on 30 September it was subordinated to Stalingrad Front. On 19 November, just before Operation Uranus began south of Stalingrad, the army was comprised as follows:
 34th Guards Rifle Division
 248th Rifle Division
 52nd, 152nd and 159th Rifle Brigades
 78th and 116th Fortified Regions
 A separate cavalry regiment (or battalion)
 6th Guards Tank Brigade
 565th Separate Tank Battalion
 35th Separate Armored Car Battalion
 30th, 33rd and 46th Separate Armored Train Battalions
As of 19 November, the army's ration strength was 64,265 men, with 47,891 men assigned to its combat forces. It fielded 1,196 guns and mortars and 80 tanks (10 heavy, 26 medium and 44 light).

On 1 July 1944 the army comprised the 
 3rd Guards Rifle Corps (50th, 54th and 96th Guards Rifle Divisions), 
 20th Rifle Corps (48th and 55th Guards Rifle Divisions, 20th Rifle Division), 
 128th Rifle Corps (61st, 130th, and 152nd Rifle Divisions) 
 artillery units including the 3rd Corps Artillery Brigade, 157th Cannon Artillery Brigade, 377th Cannon Artillery Regiment, 530th Fighter Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, 1st Mortar Brigade (from the 5th Breakthrough Artillery Division), 133rd and 316th Guards Mortar Regiments, 12th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division (836th, 977th, 990th, 997th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments), 607th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment (зенап), 
 tank forces, engineers, and other troops.

Third formation and postwar 
In September 1945, the 28th Army established its headquarters in the Baranovichi Military District. From 1945 to 1947, the number of rifle units were reduced, and their qualitative composition increased.

In September 1954, the 12th Guards Mozyrskaya Mechanised Division and the 50th Guards Stalino Rifle Division, part of the troops of the 128th Gumbinnenskogo Rifle Corps, were used to form the test units utilised at Totskoye during the test of a 40-kiloton nuclear bomb.

In 1957, rifle corps headquarters were abolished, rifle divisions reorganized into motor rifle, and mechanized divisions into tank divisions:

8th Mechanized Division – 28th Oleksandriia Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Tank Division (Slonim);
12th Guards Mechanized Division – the 33rd ( became the 15th in 1965) Guards Mozyr Red Banner Order of Suvorov Tank Division (Brest).

In August 1968, the 15th Guards Tank and 30th (up to 1965 – 55th) Guards Motor Rifle Division of the 28th Army were sent to Czechoslovakia to participate in Operation Danube, where they remained as part of the Central Group of Forces.  To replace these divisions, the 76th Tank Division was created at Brest and the 84th Motor Rifle Division at Grodno as mobilization divisions. On 15 January 1974, the army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. The 6th Guards Kiev-Berlin Tank Division transferred to Grodno in March 1980 from East Germany. To make room for the 6th Division, the 84th Motor Rifle Division was moved to the 7th Tank Army. During the 1980s, the army was composed of the 6th Guards, 28th and 76th Tank Divisions and the 50th Guards Motor Rifle Division. During the late 1980s, the 28th was disbanded and became the 6314th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base and the 76th Tank Division reorganized as the 5356th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base.

On the dissolution of the Soviet Union the 28th Army, headquartered at Grodno, included the 6th Guards Tank Division (Grodno), 6314th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base (Slonim), 50th Guards Motor Rifle Division (Brest), and the 5356th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base, also at Brest.

In 1993 the army was disbanded by being redesignated the 28th Army Corps. The corps was redesignated the Western Operational Command in 2001.

He belonged to a noble family from the Roussillon, and he was the brother of Ramon de Llupià. He had a lot of influence and was next to the king most of the time he lived.

Life 
He was son of Pere de Llupià, who was the lord of Bages in Catalonia and the castle of Monistrol in the Roussillon, and brother of Ramon de Llupià.

He was appointed bishop of Tortosa in 1379, and he was there until 1397. In 1388 he stated in his diocese the Immaculate Conception festivity, and he issued several synode constitutions for the years 1390, 1393 and 1397.
When the king of the Crown of Aragon John the Hunter died, he was part of a commission that went to Sicily in order to meet Martin the Humane and to ask him to come back to Catalonia. The Avignon Pope Benedict XIII, as a consequence of a request from King Martin, moved him to the see of Valencia, where he was bishop from 1398 to 1427, when he died. In 1408 he went to the Council of Perpignan and, when he came back to Valencia, he was triumphantly received. He did not take part, however, in the Council of Constance. He summoned a synod in 1422 and issued eight constitutions, which dealt with the mass celebration. He is buried in the main chapel of the Cathedral of Valencia. Francesc Eiximenis dedicated to him the Pastorale, which is a book written in Latin that deals with advice for priests and bishops, and that follows the classical Saint Gregory's Pastorale.

332,39033541,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow%20code,Slow code,"Slow code refers to the practice in a hospital or other medical centre to purposely respond slowly or incompletely to a patient in cardiac arrest, particularly in situations for which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is thought to be of no medical benefit by the medical staff. The related term show code refers to the practice of a medical response that is medically futile, but is attempted for the benefit of the patient's family and loved ones. However, the terms are often used interchangeably.

The practices are banned in some jurisdictions.

Background
During a patient cardiac arrest in a hospital or other medical facility, staff may be notified via a code blue alert. A medical response team, based on the institution's practices and policies, attends to the emergency. The team will perform life saving measures, including CPR, in order to re-establish both cardiac and pulmonary function.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be withheld in some circumstances. One is if the patient has a do not resuscitate (""no code"") order, such as in a living will. Another is if the patient, family member, individual with power of attorney privileges over the patient, or other surrogate decision maker for the patient, makes such a request of the medical staff. Surrogate decision makers are considered in a hierarchy: legal guardians with health care authority, individual with power of attorney for health decisions, spouse, adult children, parents, and adult siblings.

A third situation is one in which the medical staff deems that CPR will be of no clinical benefit to the patient. This includes, among other cases: a patient in severe septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome whose organ damage cannot be contained and reversed any longer, one who has had an acute stroke that has irreversibly damaged vital brain functions needed for life beyond repair (i.e., in the brain stem), or who has advanced and incurable metastatic cancer, and one with severe pneumonia which is no longer treatable with assisted ventilation methods and medication, which all have very little or no realistic probability of success. There is also a low probability of success for patients with severe hypotension that resulted from shock or severe illness or injury, and has not responded to treatment (and which was not induced), severe cases of acute or chronic kidney failure or end stage kidney disease (where dialysis and other renal replacement therapies either are no longer working or were not adequate, and where a transplant either cannot be found or is not an option), end-stage AIDS and its accompanying severe opportunistic illnesses (which are not responding to antiretroviral and drug therapy and/or the white blood cell count is too low), or those who are older than about 70 and/or homebound (where they and/or their guardians, instead of a DNR order, have authorized such half measures and the law permits it).

A patient may request, in an advance directive, to prohibit certain responses, including intubation, chest compression, electrical defibrillation, or ACLS. This is referred to as a partial code or partial resuscitation and such resuscitation ""commonly violates the ethical obligation of nonmalfeasance"". It is regarded as medically unsound because partial interventions are ""often highly traumatic and consistently inefficacious"".

Ethics
The practice is ""controversial from an ethical point of view"", as it represents a violation of a patient's trust and right ""to be involved in inpatient clinical decisions"".

In a position paper, the American Nurses Association states that ""slow codes are not ethical"".

Policy and legislation
Some medical services centres have instituted policy banning the practice.

In 1987, New York became the first state in the United States to effectively end the practice by enacting legislation to require medical staff to honour a patient's refusal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation or a do not resuscitate order, and to grant civil and criminal immunity to those who do so or those who perform CPR without knowledge of the order.

Production
The series was commissioned to accompany the docudrama series Egypt which ran concurrently on BBC One.

Reception
Sam Wollaston writing in The Guardian complemented the series as ""a more scholarly appendage to the BBC1 show,"" stating that ""Cruickshank was charming, breathless and enthusiastic, whispering every sentence to the camera as if he's telling you, and only you, an amazing secret,"" before going on to comment that his favourite scene involved a donkey, ""as favourite scenes often do."" David Chater writing in The Times complimented Cruickshank's ""inimitable style"".

David Liddiment writing in The Guardian compliments the cleverly twinning of this more cerebral series with the docudrama on BBC One but he points out that this was done during the final stages of the BBC's charter renewal review and insists that the corporation should keep up standards after this process is completed.

Episodes

""'The Secrets of the Tomb Builders""
Cruickshank finds out about the mysterious people who built the spectacular underground tombs of the Pharaohs.

Cruickshank flies over the Valley of the Kings where the pharaohs hid their tombs over 3,500 years ago. Over 60 tombs are dug into the walls of the valley where the bodies and riches inside could be guarded from tomb robbers. Descending into the massive KV5, built by Rameses II for his sons, Cruickshank is able to admire the precise engineering skills of its builders. In the Tomb of Horemheb, sealed before it could be completed, he admires the unfinished work of the tomb artists. At Deir el-Medina he sees where the generations of builder, painters, sculptors and engineers who built the tombs lived with their families kept separate from the rest of the world.

From the wealth of archaeological evidence (scraps of cloth, fragments of wood, traces of paint) archaeologist have built up a detailed picture of the tomb builders' lives. Cruickshank ponders the life of an ancient family of tomb builders at the house of Senagem. The builders were highly literate and thousands of examples of their writing on limestone and pottery have been uncovered giving detailed and intimate insights into ancient Egyptian life. From these ostraca we can see that they were not slaves but well cared for state employees who held some of the most important secrets of the state but court documents reveal these were also the tomb robbers.

Cruickshank explains how this journey has changed his view of the valley from a place of death, afterlife, ritual and religion into a place of ordinary people and their daily lives. This insight into life in this land thousands of years ago is history from the bottom up a long way from the propaganda left behind by the pharaohs.

""The Pharaoh Hunter""
Cruickshank follows in the footsteps of Howard Carter to trace the life of the man who discovered the Tomb of Tutankhamun.

Cruickshank attributes the discovery of the treasure of Tutankahmun to the sheer tenacity of Carter. Carter's solitary upbringing by maiden aunts in rural Norfolk is credited as the source of his self-reliance and sense of being an outsider. Carter left school aged 15 with little formal education but great artistic skills. Lord and Lady Amherst's Egyptian collection at nearby Diddlington Hall entranced Carter and they appointed him to a dig in Egypt. Arriving at the vibrantly decorated tombs at Beni Hasan he became disenchanted with the arid tracings he was instructed to produce and instead created beautiful watercolour renditions. Later he joined the dig at El Amarna and learned the scientific style of its leader Flinders Petrie.

At 19, Carter was appointed site artist at the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahri winning great acclaim with his newly acquired archaeological skill and was running the dig within 6 years. His subsequent appointment as Chief Inspector in Egyptian Antiquities Service arose resentment amongst more experienced archaeologists and was soon forced to resign. The outcast Carter eventually teamed up with Lord Carnarvon and the two began the search for Tutankhamun which eventually succeeded thanks to Carter's stubbornness. The project took over the life of the meticulous Carter who fell-out with Carnarvon over the disposition of the find further isolating him.

Carter spent over a decade completing the excavation of the site before being gently pushed aside by the authorities and returning to a solitary existence in England where later he died leaving behind a magnificent archaeological legacy.

""The Rebel Pharoah""
Cruickshank goes on the trail of Egypt's most controversial ruler and his beautiful wife Nefertiti.

The Pharaoh Akhenaten is described as a revolutionary whose dangerous ideas would change politics, religion, art and language leading the nation to the brink of catastrophe. Preserved statues of Akhnaten do not conform to the traditional depictions of a pharaoh highlighting his unconventional style. Early in his reign he underwent a religious conversion and proposed replacing the pantheon of gods with a single sun god. Wall paintings from the tomb of Chief Vizier Ramosa illustrate this overthrow.

Akhnaten left the ancient capital of Luxor to build a religious utopia in the desert to break from the past and honour his new monotheistic god. The great temple at Amarna opened up to the sun but only the Pharaoh and his family were allowed in. Akhnaton came to believe that he was the son of god and should be worshipped as such. He initiated a persecution of believers in the old gods and Egypt lost status as the Pharaoh became disassociated from the real world. Art works preserved at the site show unprecedented images of the royal family displaying humanistic emotions of affection and grief.

A plague sweeps the land, taking Akhnaten's wife and children, and the Pharaoh is held responsible as social order begins to fall apart. Akhnaten's death, possibly at the hands of his own courtiers, leads to his successor Tutankhamun abandoning Amarna and restoring the old gods. All trace of Akhnaten was buried, ironically preserving it for modern archaeologist.

""Building for Eternity""
Cruickshank explores how and why the ancient Egyptians made things to last forever, fuelled by their belief in eternity.

Egyptian belief in an afterlife led to the development of ingenious techniques that have preserved much of their culture to this day. At Saqqara the Pharaoh Zoza built upon the traditional stone monument to create Egypt's first step pyramid as part of a stone complex designed to last forever. Zoza continually expanded his pyramid confirming the importance of size that culminated with the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza. Later monuments use granite ferried down the Nile from distant Aswan to achieve the same level of eternity.

The Nile was the fertile centre of the Egyptian world and its seasonal cycle inspired the very idea of eternity. They developed mummification to maintain the body for this continuing renewal. Following preservation the heart was reinserted as the seat of the soul and rituals were conducted to reawaken the senses of the deceased. Ancient Egyptians also believed such rituals necessary for the annual flooding of the Nile and the rising of the sun and great temples such as the one at Dendera were built to facilitate this.

The temples were the engines of eternity built on massive scale to last forever as a route from the world of man to that of the gods with only the most privileged allowed access. The longevity of the Egyptian civilisation allowed some to question the very nature of eternity as they witnessed the desolation of ancient monuments but much has survived allowing the ancients to live on.

""Pharoah's Wives""
Cruickshank goes on the trail of a pharaoh's wife who committed a crime so terrible they tried to wipe her name from history.

The last of the great pharaohs Ramesses III died in mysterious circumstances surrounded by enemies and civil disobedience. In the first year of his reign he ordered the construction of Medinet-Habu filled with great depictions of his huge wealth and military victories and unprecedented depictions of his prowess with women. Ancient papyri bought on Cairo's black market in the 19th century however tell of an indecisive man unable even to choose between Tiye and Isis as his great queen.

Tiye and Isis compete to have their son named as heir of Ramesses III and the Pharaoh eventually chooses Isis. Tiye plots to murder the Pharaoh and seize the country in a military coup. Tiye uses spells stolen from the Pharaoh's own library against him and recruits many important generals and courtiers into her conspiracy (including the food-taster). Ramesses's failing health and poor political decisions lead to civil disobedience and revolt across the country. Ti seizes the opportunity and within the month Ramesses III is dead presumably from poisoning.

The subsequent coup however fails and Isis's son Pharaoh Ramesses IV round up the conspirators and puts them on trial. The harem women's final plot to seduce the judges is discovered and all the conspirators are executed. Isis and her son Pentawere are chiselled from history and only the papyri survive to tell their story.

""The Death of Ancient Egypt""
Cruickshank travels the length of the country to find out what brought this remarkable civilisation to an abrupt and tragic end.

The arrival of Alexander the Great in 332 BC ushered in the 300 years rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty where Greek culture would challenge the old beliefs. The Greeks however were seduced by the mystery and magic of Ancient Egyptian and erected statues to the old god in their temples. Cleopatra, despite her Greek blood, became the archetypal Egyptian with even her legendary death at the bite of a sacred asp designed to usher her into the eternal pantheon of Egyptian deities.

The Romans marched into Egypt in 30 BC intent on turning it into an imperial province and bled the country dry to sustain the Empires extensive territories. The vast resources of Egypt supplied one third of Romes grain as well as gold and granite. The country was bankrupted, the temples neglected and the priests disregarded but the beliefs lived on to seduce the Roman oppressors with some even being mummified.

Christianity was adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire and enforced upon the Egyptians. Greeks and Romans could blend their own pantheons with those of Egypt but Christianity was monotheistic and intolerant regarding old gods as devils. Ancient rituals were appropriated and transformed, including the Ptolomeic idea of monasticism, finally defeating the old gods by the mid-4th century when over half the Egyptian population had converted to Christianity and the rest were persecuted.

The last of believers in the old faith retreated to the Island of Philae, where the last Demotic hieroglyphs were carved in 394 AD, and when this bastion finally fell a 3000-year-old culture had been wiped out and its knowledge forgotten.

She was the director of Fem magazine for nearly 30 years and wrote as a correspondent for several newspapers and magazines. Her journalism was honored with the National Journalism Prize ""Juan Ignacio Castorena y Visúa"". She was an advocate for both contraception and abortion rights. Through her many activities, she co-founded the Coalición de Mujeres Feministas, the Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres and pressed for the founding of the first Rape Crisis and Guidance Center (Coapevi), first agency for dealing specifically with sexual crimes, first Center for Domestic and Sexual Violence (NOTIFY). In 1998, the first Center for Support of Women which was named after her was opened.

Biography
Esperanza Brito Moreno was born in 1932 in Mexico City to the rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Rodulfo Brito Foucher and the writer and feminist Esperanza Moreno.

Brito married at nineteen and raised six children before questioning her life choices. In 1963, she decided to pursue a journalism career and began writing for the society page of Novedades. In 1966, she read an article her mother had written for El Universal entitled 'Yo, sí soy feminista' (I, yes I, am a feminist) and came to the realization that feminism was not about being ""against men, but against the oppressive and discriminatory system(s) that makes all women inferior beings to all men"". The following year, she co-founded the organization Coalición de Mujeres Feministas (Coalition of Women Feminists). The woman began to analyze the Mexican legal codes for discrimination, so that they could present facts and prove that many of the federal programs had policies that ran counter to equality, including those related to family and parenthood. Characterized as Betty Friedan's ""analog"", Brito cofounded the Coalición de Mujeres Feministas in 1967.

In 1970, she moved to Novedades editorial page for a year and in 1971 took a job at Siempre, which lasted three years.1972 Brito and 23 other women founded the Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres (National Movement of Women), for which she became president and participated in the first protests against the death of women by illegal abortions. She won the National Journalism Prize ""Juan Ignacio Castorena y Visúa"" in 1974 for a piece analyzing women activists entitled, ""Cuando la Mujer Mexicana Quiere, Puede"" (When Mexican Women Want, They Can Get). At the United Nations first World Conference on Women, held in Mexico City, in 1975, Brtio came in contact for the first time with radical feminist ideology. These activists were hoping for gains in contraception and a woman's right to make her own body choices. Pressed by activists, president Luis Echeverría convened the Interdisciplinary Group for the Study of Abortion, which included anthropologists, attorneys, clergy (Catholic, Jewish and Protestant), demographers, economists, philosophers, physicians, and psychologists. Their findings, contained in a report issued in 1976, which the Congress never passed nor implemented, were that criminalization of voluntary abortion should cease and that abortion services should be included in the government health package. The report also highlighted the need for sexual education as early as primary school; information about contraception from high school forward; access to contraception; rejection of forced sterilization; and the rejection of abortion as a population control system. Brito and her colleagues pushed for all of these demands to be met. 

She changed jobs around this time and worked at the Almanac of Mexico from 1977 to 1984 with her son, Fernando Martí, who was also a journalist. Simultaneously, she began publishing in a variety of newspapers and magazines, including El Universal and worked as the editorial coordinator for Publicaciones Continentales de México (Continental Publications of Mexico), which produced the Mexican versions of Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and Vanity Fair. She led a protest on the steps of the Chamber of Deputies in 1982 demanding that motherhood be free and voluntary and that women had the right to live free of violence and discrimination and with equal political and civil rights. In 1987, she began directing Fem magazine, which had been founded by Alaíde Foppa, where she remained for the next 21 years and then directed the electronic version for another two years. In 1988 she helped found the first Rape Crisis and Guidance Center (Coapevi) and in 1989 helped open the first agency which specialized in dealing with sexual crimes. In 1990, Brito was instrumental in pushing for the creation the first Center for Domestic and Sexual Violence (NOTIFY) and passage of the first laws on sexual assault.

In 1996, she took over, from her mother, the direction of the Child Nutritional Rehabilitation Centre organized by Elena Arizmendi Mejia's under the La Cruz Blanca, continuing her work at Fem. Two years later, in 1998, Brito's work was publicly acknowledged when the first Center for Support of Women opened in Mexico City bearing her name. In 2005, she retired from Fem.

Esperanza Brito de Martí died in Mexico City on 16 August 2007.

In 1919 she became HMS Afrikander and was transferred to the South African Naval Service in 1923, becoming HMSAS Afrikander. She was returned to the Royal Navy in December 1932 and re-named HMS Afrikander II in 1933.  She was finally broken up at Simon's Town in 1937.

Royal Navy gunboat
Tickler was launched on 15 September 1879 as the last of the Royal Navy  flat-iron gunboats. She was listed at Portsmouth ""for coastal defence"" in 1881 and in 1885, during the Russian War Scare, she, Gadfly and Griper were towed to the Cape by the transports Richmond Hill and Kimberley. She was recommissioned in South Africa in 1891. At Simon's Town in 1902 she was converted to a steam lighter.

Base ship, Simon's Town
She was used as a base depot ship servicing the Royal Navy and South African Naval Services fleets in Simon's Town harbour and False Bay.  She was renamed HMS Afrikander in 1919.  When the South African Naval Service was created on 1 April 1922, all officers and men were nominally registered in the books of Afrikander.  This was required because the Naval Discipline Act stated that in order to be subservient to the Act, all members had to be serving on a HM Ship.  The Act was amended in 1923 and Afrikander was then transferred to the Union of South African Seaward Defence Force as HMSAS Afrikander. She was returned to the Royal Navy in December 1932 and renamed HMS Afrikander II in 1933.

Fate
After decommissioning she was scuttled and sunk by gunfire from HMS Daffodil, at Simonstown in 1937.

343,3495069,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic%20sheep,Icelandic sheep,"The Icelandic is the Icelandic breed of domestic sheep. It belongs to the Northern European Short-tailed group of sheep, and is larger than most breeds in that group.  It is thought that it was introduced to Iceland by Vikings in the late ninth or early tenth century.

It is generally short-legged and stocky, slender and light-boned, and usually horned, although polled and polycerate animals can occur; there is a polled strain, the Kleifa. The fleece is double-coated and may be white or a variety of other colors; the face and legs are without wool. The sheep are highly resistant to cold, and are generally left unshorn for the winter. Icelandic ewes are highly prolific, with a lambing percentage of 175–220%. The Þoka (Thoka) gene is carried by some ewes, which may give birth to large litters of lambs. A unique strain within the population is the Leader sheep, which carries a hereditary ability or predisposition to lead other sheep safely over dangerous ground.

History 

It is thought that the sheep were introduced to Iceland by Vikings in the late ninth or early tenth century.

Breed numbers reached a peak in 1978, when there were approximately 891 000, or about four sheep for every inhabitant of Iceland. By 2007 the total number had fallen to about 450 000. In 2018 a population of just over 432 000 was reported to DAD-IS.

Characteristics 

The colors of Icelandic sheep are inherited in a similar way to those of other sheep, but they display more variety in color and pattern than most other breeds, and some variations are seen which are not seen in other sheep.  Each sheep carries three genes that affect the color of the sheep, and  each gene has dominant and recessive alleles.

Use 

Until the 1940s the Icelandic sheep was the predominant milk-producing animal in Iceland. In the twenty-first century this sheep is reared principally for meat, which accounts for more than 80% of the total income derived from sheep farming.

The fleece is double-coated, with a long outer coat () which gives protection from snow and rain, and a fine inner coat () which insulates the animal against the cold. The wool of the outer coat has a diameter of about  or sometimes more, and a staple length of some  the inner coat has a diameter of  or sometimes less, with a staple length in the range  The two types may be used separately, or spun into a single yarn, lopi, a soft wool which provides good insulation.

It was under the jurisdiction of the Internal Troops of the NKVD but took strategic orders from the 62nd Army command. Later it converted into a regular Red Army division and was renamed the 181st ""Order of Lenin"" ""Stalingrad"" Rifle Division.

Brief Timeline

1 February 1942 - Division was formed by the GKO Order no. 1099: ""Concerning the organization of the garrison troops of the NKVD in the cities, and Red Army liberation"" and the order of the NKVD no. 0021
November 1942 - By order of the NKVD no. 002356, it was renamed and reorganized into 'Stalingrad' Rifle Division of the NKVD according to the staff of the NKO

5 February 1943 - Transferred to the Red Army and renamed the 181st 'Stalingrad' of the Order of Lenin Rifle Division

History

Formation of the Division
In early 1942, the Oblast Committee (Obkom) of the Party and the City Committee of Defense were instructed that Stalingrad would form a division. Later, this division had the grievous task of being one of the first to enter the unequal battle against the German forces breaking through to Stalingrad. The terms of formation and composition of the division were determined by a special resolution from the GKO. Units of the 10th NKVD, commanded by Colonel Alexander A. Sarayev, arrived in Stalingrad in January 1942. Major Vasiliy Ivanovich Zaytsev was appointed Chief of Staff of the Division. The core of the division were soldiers and commanders of the Border Troops from Ural and Siberian regions including Sverdlovsk, Irkutsk, and Novosibirsk, but the nuclei of the 269th and 270th regiments were citizens of Stalingrad, Party workers, and members of the Komsomol organizations of the city. Roughly three thousand Stalingrad locals served in the division.

Operational Activities Prior to the Battle of Stalingrad
The division performed the tasks of policing in Stalingrad, and in the surrounding Oblast, in Voronezh, in the rears of the Southwestern Front, the Voronezh Front, and Stalingrad Front; enforcing martial law; and the task of preventing enemy recon and saboteur groups from operating in these rear areas.
29 January – 3 July 1942 - 41st Rifle Regiment protected law and order in and around Voronezh.
17–22 March 1942 - The division at Stalingrad conducted a documentation screening operation of the city's population and successfully detained nine spies, 106 criminals, and 187 people with variously suspicious documents.
Sometime in June, 1942 - 273rd Rifle Regiment near the village of Novoaninsky destroyed a landing of Germans (Brandenburgers) armed with Soviet weapons and equipment disguised as Red Army soldiers, killing 47 of them and capturing 2.
3–31 July 1942 - 41st Rifle Regiment took part in the defense of Voronezh, the first of the regiments of the division to take part in the frontline fighting during this period. The regiment killed up to 1,500 Germans and captured 17 machine guns, 42 machine pistols, 730 rifles, 415 grenades, 17,000 rounds of ammunition. The regiment suffered a loss of one third of its personnel in killed, wounded and missing.
12 July 1942 - The division is included in the active Army
13–27 July 1942 - In the defense of the rear of the Stalingrad Front, the division arrested 15 spies and 2,775 people (Brandenburgers) found without valid documents.
Sometime in July 1942 - The division formed an auxiliary artillery battalion.
August 1942 - 41st Rifle Regiment was detached from the division and assigned to the 18th Independent Sappers Brigade of the NKVD Internal Troops.

Fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad
The division, alongside the people's militias, received the first blow of the Germans penetrating towards the Volga in the summer of 1942. Worker's militias were not just employed here in reconnaissance, but were deployed to catch enemy parachutists, spies, and saboteurs.

In appreciation of the division's defense of the city, the commander of the 62nd Army Vasiliy Chuykov said: ""The fighters of Colonel Sarayev's 10th Stalingrad Division VV must have been the first defenders of Stalingrad, and they overcame the difficult challenge with flying colours, courageously and selflessly fighting against superior enemy forces until the arrival of the 62nd Army.""

The division, stretched over , led many fierce battles against the Germans. In the early stages of the battle for the city, the divisional HQ was billeted in the Tsarina gulley, not far from the ""Lighthouse"" restaurant.

The 10th Division, with a battalion of industrial workers, successfully defended the F. Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory and later counter-attacked to regain several kilometres, despite shortages in technology and manpower.

On 2 August 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the 270th Rifle Regiment first engaged the Germans in Stalingrad.

On 14 August 1942, the 273rd Rifle Regiment detached from the division and joined the 12th ""Ordzhonikidzevskaya"" Rifle Division of the NKVD VV.

The bulk of the division's forces defended the west and south-west of the city, holding these areas against the sudden breakout of the enemy into the city. In addition to this, there was a consolidated battalion in the north. On 16 August, the 282nd Rifle Regiment of the 12th NKVD VV Rifle Division arrived from Saratov and was attached to the 10th. This regiment was immediately sent to the north to reinforcement the composite battalion. On the left bank of the Volga, the division was supported by several reserve regiments from High Command.

The 272nd Rifle Regiment, under command of G. P. Savchuk, and a group of student volunteers occupied a Military-Political Academy in the path of an impending enemy breakthrough. During five days of fierce fighting, the regiment denied elements of the 295th Infantry, 71st Infantry and 24th Panzer Divisions (all belonging to the LI Armeekorps). These enemy forces suffered heavy losses and the Germans' plan to capture the center of the city and the major crossing of the Volga was thwarted.

On 8 September began fighting for the southern part of the Voroshilov district. By mid-afternoon of 9 September, forward units of the NKVD, who were on the second line, had come under direct enemy attack. The Soviets launched a swift counterattack and the Germans were caught by surprise.

On 12 September, the fighting for the defense of the South-Eastern Front of Stalingrad was assigned to the 62nd Army, to which the 10th NKVD VV Division was now attached.

On 13 September, the enemy planned another assault on the city. In the morning they hit Soviet fortified positions, including those of the 269th Rifle Regiment of the 10th NKVD, with heavy artillery and mortar fire. Aviation groups of up to 40 aircraft bombed areas in the Russian rear. At 7:00, the offensive began. For three hours, elements of the 62nd Army repelled enemy attacks which penetrated the first line, knocked out forward posts, and reached the positions of the 269th Rifle Regiment. In this difficult and hazardous situation, the 269th held their area, blocking the path to the Hill 102.0 Mamayev Kurgan. In the center of this fighting was the 270th Rifle Regiment under the command of Major A.K. Zhuravlev. Despite their numerical superiority, the enemy did not successfully enter the center of Stalingrad on 13 September.

The next day began again with German air and artillery bombardments in preparation for an attack. The entire Soviet front from Mamayev Kurgan to Kuporosnoye suffered German shock-attacks. Following these, the entire German front advanced with large-scale infantry and armour formations. Against the 269th Rifle Regiment alone the Germans concentrated up to eight battalions and 50 tanks. At 1400 hours, two submachine gun battalions with three tanks penetrated the regiment's rear and captured the peak of Mamayev Kurgan. The Germans then began firing on the ""Red October"" factory. To recapture the peak, a submachine gun company of the 269th, under command of Junior Lieutenant Lyubeznov, and the 416th Rifle Regiment of the 112th Rifle Division with two tanks launched a counterattack. By 1800 hours, the height has been cleared out.

Over the two days of fighting, the 269th Rifle Regiment killed and wounded more than a thousand soldiers and officers and disabled 20 enemy tanks.

On the night of 15 September, the enemy infiltrated the positions of the NKVD and specialists, captured the train-station and reached the rear of the 262nd regiment and 1st battalion of the 270th regiment. Nothing was prepared to repel such an infiltration and bloody, desperate fighting ensued from Mamayev to Kuporosnoye.

At dawn on 16 September, four soldiers of the division waged an unequal battle against advancing tanks for several hours. They destroyed a total of 20 vehicles and were all posthumously awarded with high state honours.

Together with elements of the 10th NKVD's northern groups, the 62nd Army conducted bitter defensive operations all through September and regained ground in some areas. On 7 October, surviving soldiers of the regiment  were consolidated into two companies and which were added to the consolidated battalion under the command of the Captain Ryabchevskiy. Every day they fought off several fierce attacks from the enemy, preventing him from breaking through to the tractor plant.

From August 1942 onward, from the elements of the 10th NKVD remained the 282nd Infantry Regiment, defending the height of 135.4.

Between 23 August – 8 October 1942 during the battle of Stalingrad, the division killed or wounded up to 15,000 German soldiers and officers, destroyed or disabled 113 tanks, 8 armored vehicles, destroyed or captured 6 guns, 51 mortars, 138 machine guns, two ammunition depots, 2 aircraft shot down, and seized a German regiment's banner.

For exemplary service in the combat operations in the defense of the Volga shores, the Soviet High Command awarded the 10th NKVD VV Division with the Order of Lenin on 2 December 1942.

Further history
Divisional losses were heavy. By order of the commander of the Stalingrad Front, the division was demobilized in early October 1942 and moved to the village of Zaplavnoye. The division consisted of little more than 200 men of initial 7568.

In mid-October 1942, the division headquarters was ordered to redeploy to the city of Chelyabinsk to reorganize. The division took on a new structure:
Three Rifle Regiments
One Artillery Regiment
One Auxiliary Anti-Tank Battalion
Various support and logistical units

The core of the newly organized unit was approximately 2,700 men and officers who were veterans of the battle of Stalingrad. The battle of Stalingrad ended on 2 February 1943, and on 5 February the division was renamed the 181st Rifle Division and transferred to regular Red Army command. Subsequently, the fighting experience and techniques of the men of ""Stalingradskaya"" were further developed in the battle of Kursk in the crossing of the Vistula river. The division saw the close of the war while in Breslau.

Order of battle

The commander Sarayev wrote thus about the division:
Our 10th Division was formed in early 1942. It is composed of:
The 271st Rifle Regiment. It is mostly composed of the sons of Ural metallurgists and mechanical engineers, they were characterized by a high class- and political-consciousness.
The 272nd Rifle Regiment. It included mostly Siberians, youth, so the regiment was known as the ""Komsomolskiy"". The boldness of youth and enthusiasm in combat - that's what distinguished this regiment in subsequent battles.
The 282nd Rifle Regiment. Its men came almost exclusively from Volzhan. They, like the others, showed fortitude and courage in battle.
The 269th and 270th Rifle Regiments were formed in Stalingrad, mainly from local residents. They fought valiantly for their hometown.

The Library is at 3939 Central Ave, Columbia Heights, Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. Columbia Heights is a first ring suburb of Minneapolis and serves the greater communities of Anoka, Hennepin and Ramsey Counties. The Columbia Heights Public Library is a city-owned library funded by a city library levy.  It is one of five city owned and operated libraries in the Metropolitan Library Service Agency (MELSA) including Bayport, South St. Paul, Saint Paul, and Stillwater.

History
The Columbia Heights Public Library opened its doors for the first time on December 3, 1928, at 3949 Central Ave N.E., on the main level of the Heights Theater, and later moved to the second floor.  The previous month the Silver Lake School Mothers' Club, with President Harriet Blythe, decided the City of Columbia Heights needed a public library since it was opening its first public high school.  Members of the club canvassed the neighborhoods on foot with children's wagons to solicit donations of books, magazines, and furniture. On November 17, 1928, Margaret Thomas, a high school teacher, agreed to head the first Library Board. In 1938, the library moved to the second floor of a building at 4002 Central Ave. The library moved to 828 40th Ave, and became the ""War Information Center"" in 1941.   The library, located in a rented building at 838 40th Ave N.E., was recognized by the City Council as a department of the city in 1952, when it celebrated its 25th anniversary.   The Library moved in 1960 to 820 40th Ave NE, and the first professional librarian was hired.  In 1966, the Library obtained an LSCA (Library Services and Construction Act) grant and a Civil Defense grant to fund an addition to the original building. The building housed the library on the first floor and the City Civil Defense program in the lower level. In 1971, the Library negotiated to join the newly created MELSA through a contract with the Anoka County Library.  The contract provided reciprocal borrowing and returns, and inter-library loans. In 1971, the Civil Defense area of the building was taken over by the library and remodeled to house the Children's Department and activity room.  In 1979, The Friends of the Library were reorganized after a hiatus of several years, with Helen Merrick as the president. The Columbia Heights Friends are individuals and families who support services and programs at the library. The Friends provide financial support for materials and services, and host special library events.
Over the next several years the library made technological advances with a materials security system installed in 1984, automation of the circulation system in 1987, an online public catalog in 1992, public Internet access provided in 1997 (graphics available in 2000), and a web-based catalog activated in 1998.
In 1994, the building was brought up to full ADA compliance by installing an elevator, handicapped accessible restroom, ADA compliant signage and furniture.  The ADA compliance project utilized CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) funds. The membrane roofing was replaced with a built-up tar and shingle product, and all computer wiring was upgraded to category 5 cable in 1999.
In 2001, the public access terminals were replaced with PCs and the circulation terminals were replaced in 2002.
In 2009, the Library received a Gates Online Opportunity Hardware grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for public use computers. Also in 2009, the Library received a ""Picturing America"" grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which included photographic reproductions of famous American works of art, an After School Community Learning Grant for programing, a 21st Century grant for programing, and a Dollar General literacy Foundation grant for materials.
In 2016, the library moved into a newly-constructed building at 3939 Central Avenue Northeast. The building was designed by HGA Architects and built by Ebert Construction.

Library Groups

The Columbia Heights Library Board
The Library Board was established in 1928 as the governing body to supervise policy, programs, budget, the physical library, and staffing.

The Friends of the Library
The Columbia Heights Friends of the Library are individuals and families who support the library through the provision of materials, equipment, and volunteer time.

The Library Foundation
The Columbia Heights Library Foundation is a non-profit organization created in 2001 and their mission is “to generate financial support for enhancement of library facilities and services through community partnerships.”

Awards and honors
 On December 4, 2014, the publishing house has received the «Special Award Franco Cuomo International Award» for the «development of new forms of cultural expression, social and human of our time».
 Creative Europe Literally Translation 2015: The Project «Altriarabi Migrante» consists of seven volumes. The selection includes works published between 2003–2014 by European Authors of Arab origin (1°-2° generation), born from 1971 to 1992, from France, United Kingdom, Germany and Netherlands (countries with the highest percentage of Arab immigrants). The books have a high quality, which has allowed them to win prizes. The works are characterized by an analysis of the sense of belonging and national identity, torn between the land of origin, modernity and Europe and the discomfort this conflict brings. Strong themes of cultural hybridization emerge: in some works it arises from a language mixed with Arabic words and hybrid structures between new and original language. There is a constant reformulation of power relations between real and symbolic centres and fringes.

350,11186897,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasseh%20%28tribal%20patriarch%29,Manasseh (tribal patriarch),"Manasseh or Menashe () was, according to the Book of Genesis, the first son of Joseph and Asenath (). Asenath was an Egyptian woman whom the Pharaoh gave to Joseph as wife, and the daughter of Potipherah, a priest of On (). Manasseh was born in Egypt before the arrival of the children of Israel from Canaan ().

Biblical narrative

According to the biblical account in Genesis 41:51, the name Manasseh (given to him by Joseph) means ""God has made me forget entirely my troubles and my father's house"".

Jacob, Joseph's father, adopted Joseph's two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to share in Jacob's inheritance equally with Jacob's own sons (). Manasseh is counted as the father of the Israelite Tribe of Manasseh, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jacob also blessed Ephraim over his older brother ().
 
Manasseh had a son, Asriel, with his wife; and Machir with his Aramean concubine ().  and  refer to a son called Jair, who ""took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and [who] called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair.

Biblical criticism
In the Biblical account, Joseph's other son is Ephraim, and Joseph himself is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, the other being Benjamin. Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Manasseh and Ephraim were considered one tribe - that of Joseph; according to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost. A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the Joseph tribes (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout. According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to Laban to obtain a wife originated as a metaphor for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt; according to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and doesn't mention the other tribal matriarchs at all.

The Book of Chronicles states that Manasseh was married to an Aramean concubine, and that they had two sons, named Asriel and Machir; in the Torah's genealogy of Manasseh's family, which textual scholars ascribe to the earlier priestly source, Asriel instead appears to be the son of Gilead, the son of Machir. Near the end of the book of Genesis, according to some English translations of the Bible (such as the King James Version), Manasseh's grandchildren are described as having been brought up upon Joseph's knees, while other English translations (such as the Revised Version) render the same text as born upon Joseph's knees; the gloss for this passage given by some English translations (such as the New International Version) is that the grandchildren were adopted by Joseph as his own children, at the moment they were born.

Rabbinical interpretations 
In the Torah, the eventual precedence of the tribe of Ephraim is argued to derive from Joseph tricking Jacob, blind and on his deathbed, into blessing Ephraim before Manasseh. The text describing this blessing features a hapax legomenon – the word שכל (sh-k-l) – which classical rabbinical literature has interpreted in esoteric manners; some rabbinical sources connect the term with sekel, meaning mind/wisdom, and view it as indicating that Jacob was entirely aware of who he was actually blessing; other rabbinical sources connect the term with shikkel, viewing it as signifying that Jacob was despoiling Manasseh in favour of Ephraim; yet other rabbinical sources argue that it refers to the power of Jacob to instruct and guide the holy spirit.

The Targum Pseudo-Jonathan argues that Manasseh had been a steward in Joseph's household, and had acted as an interpreter between Joseph and his other brothers; this targum also mentions that Manasseh had unusually large strength.

Herbert Armstrong
British Israelite Herbert W. Armstrong of the Worldwide Church of God (1940s to 1980s), in a book called The United States and Great Britain in Prophecy, claimed the United States was a remnant of the Tribe of Manasseh. British Israelite theories are uniformly rejected by mainstream modern scholarship.

Veneration 
Manasses is venerated in Catholic Church as saint, his feast day is 3 November or 19 December.

355,33259773,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCsseldorf%20Volksgarten%20station,Düsseldorf Volksgarten station,"Düsseldorf Volksgarten station is in the district of Oberbilk in central Düsseldorf in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is on the Cologne–Duisburg line and is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station.  it is served by Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn lines S 1 and S 6 and by line 706 of the Düsseldorf tram network, which has an adjoining stop. In 2002, the number of entering, exiting and transferring passengers was around 10,000–15,000 per working day. It is one of the six most highly frequented railway stations in the city of Düsseldorf. It belongs to the tariff area of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (Rhine-Ruhr Transport Association) and is located in fare zone 53: Düsseldorf-Süd.

Location 

The station is on the line between Cologne and Duisburg, about 2 km south of Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof. It is located on the borders of the districts of Düsseldorf-Friedrichstadt, Düsseldorf-Oberbilk and Dusseldorf-Bilk. It is elevated on the railway above the streets of Oberbilker Allee and Kruppstraße. South of the platform are the sports facilities of TuRU Düsseldorf including its football stadium, Stadion an der Feuerbachstraße. On the opposite side of Kruppstraße is the entrance to a park called Volksgarten (""people’s garden""), after which the station is named. This was substantially upgraded for the Federal Garden Show in 1987. Volksgarten station, along with the next station towards Cologne, Düsseldorf-Oberbilk, had a major role in conveying people to the Garden Show.

History

Volksgarten Dusseldorf station was built to coincide with the opening of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn in September 1967. There was no earlier station at this point. The line opened between the stations of Düsseldorf-Garath and Ratingen Ost, including Volksgarten, was the first new commuter line built in Germany after the Second World War.

In preparation for the 1987 Federal Garden Show, new equipment was added to the station. At the western and the eastern area of the platform, two large roof structures were installed to protect passengers from rain.

As part of a modernisation at several stations in Düsseldorf, the station was equipped at the beginning of the 2000s with new train destination indicators with split-flap displays.

Station layout

The station has a central platform with entrances on Oberbilker Allee and on Kruppstraße and Straße Auf'm Hennekamp. However, these only have stairs rather than escalators. Since it has no lift, the station does not have barrier-free access for the disabled.

Services 

Volksgarten station is located on the south-eastern branch of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn through Düsseldorf. It is served by lines S 1 and S 6 at 20-minute intervals. It is also served by some services on line S 68 during peak hours. It is also served by tram line 706 running to central Düsseldorf and other eastern and southern districts. Line 706 runs throughout the day as a ring line at 10-minute intervals.

357,2719395,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%20of%20Komana,Gabriel of Komana,"Gabriel of Komana (born Guido de Vylder, June 13, 1946 – October 26, 2013) was an Eastern Orthodox archbishop of the Ecumenical Patriarchate who led the Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe from 2003 to 2013.

Born in Lokeren, Belgium, to a Catholic Flemish family, he studied philosophy and theology until 1974, afterwards obtaining his diploma in moral and religious studies at the University of Leuven. During this time he was introduced to Orthodox Christianity at the parish of St. Andrew in Ghent, becoming Orthodox in January 1974.

Ordained deacon on 5 October 1975 by Archbishop George Tarassov at the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Paris, he was ordained a celibate priest on 27 June 1976 at the same cathedral. In 1977 he was assigned as priest of the parish in Maastricht. He was also active in the foundation of Orthodox communities at Deventer, Breda and Antwerp. In 1992 he was appointed rector of the parish in Liege, Belgium. In 1998 he was additionally appointed rector of the parish of Maastricht.

Having taken monastic vows in 1994, he was elected and consecrated an auxiliary bishop of the exarchate in 2001. From December 2002 he acted as administrator of the exarchate during the final illness of his predecessor Archbishop Serge (Konovaloff). On May 1, 2003 he was elected to lead the exarchate.  His election was formally confirmed on May 3 the same year. His enthronement took place in the Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky in Paris on June 1, 2004.

On 8 June 2006 the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople had met and issued a statement receiving Bishop Basil of Sergievo into the Patriarchate of Constantinople - an act that caused substantial controversy, as he had not been released from the Moscow Patriarchate. The same statement gave Bishop Basil the new title, Bishop of Amphipolis (taken from an ancient see in Greece that no longer has a bishop), and charged him with the care of parishes in Great Britain and Ireland, as auxiliary bishop under Archbishop Gabriel of Komana in Paris. One day after the Council of the Archdiocese during an extraordinary meeting created the Vicariate. At that time, no such parishes existed. After his appointment a number of parishes and communities, as well as some of the clergy and laity of the Diocese of Sourozh, followed Bishop Basil into the Archdiocese and came to constitute the Episcopal Vicariate. Other parishes and communities were formed later, where none had previously existed, for example in Cumbria, and Northampton.. Bishop Basil's first liturgical service as a member of the Archdiocese was a concelebration of the Divine Liturgy with Archbishop Gabriel in the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Paris on 18 June 2006. Statutes were adopted by the Episcopal Vicariate on 23 June 2007, and the Vicariate was registered as a charity (registration number 1124252) on 29 May 2008. Since Bishop Basil retired (on 12 October 2009) the Vicariate has become a deanery within the Archdiocese.

In January 2013 Archbishop Gabriel retired for health reasons, having been suffering from cancer, and returned to Maastricht.  He died there on October 26, 2013.

358,535928,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual%20evolution,Spiritual evolution,"Spiritual evolution, also called higher evolution, is the idea that the mind or spirit, in analogy to biological evolution, collectively evolves from a simple form dominated by nature, to a higher form dominated by the Spiritual or Divine. It is differentiated from the ""lower"" or biological evolution, and thought to be foreshadowed by enlightened beings who have already evolved to this advanced stage.

Definition

An alternate term is ""Higher Evolution."" According to Piyasīlo,

The concept of spiritual evolution is teleological, in contrast to biological evolution.

Origins of the concept

Evolution

Hegel

Western esotericism

Theories of spiritual evolution are important in many Occult and Esoteric teachings, which emphasise the progression and development of the individual either after death (spiritualism) or through successive reincarnations (Theosophy, Hermeticism).

The great chain of being
The concept of the great chain of being developed by Plato and Aristotle whose ideas were taken up and synthesised by Plotinus. Plotinus in turn heavily influenced Augustine's theology, and from there Aquinas and the Scholastics. The Great Chain of Being was an important theme in Renaissance and Elizabethan thought, had an under-acknowledged influence on the shaping of the ideas of the Enlightenment and played a large part in the worldview of 18th century Europe. And while essentially a static worldview, by the 18th and early 19th century it had been ""temporalized"" by the concept of the soul ascending or progressing spiritually through the successive rungs or stages, and thus growing or evolving closer to God. It also had at this time an impact on theories of biological evolution.

E. F. Schumacher, author of Small is Beautiful, has recently proposed a sort of simplified Great Chain of Being, based on the idea of four ""kingdoms"" (mineral, vegetable, animal, human). Schumacher rejects modernist and scientific themes, his approach recalling the universalist orientation of writers like Huston Smith, and likely contributing to Ken Wilber's ""holonomic"" hierarchy or ""Great Nest of Being"".

Spiritualism

Spiritualists reacted with uncertainty to the theories of evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking, the concept of evolution fit the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, a belief in the animal origins of man threatened the foundation of the immortality of the spirit, for if man had not been created, it was scarcely plausible that he would be specially endowed with a spirit. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.

In the 19th century, Anglo-American Spiritualist ideas emphasized the progression of the soul after death to higher states of existence, in contrast to Spiritism which admits to reincarnation.

Spiritualism taught that after death, spirits progressed to new spheres of existence. According to this idea, evolution occurred in the spirit world “at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favorable to growth” than encountered on earth.

The biologist and spiritualist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913) believed that qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular, the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a supernatural agency. Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an immaterial origin for the higher mental faculties of humans. He believed that evolution suggested the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes. In a 1909 magazine article entitled The World of Life, which he later expanded into a book of the same name Wallace argued in his 1911 book World of life for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as “creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose”. Wallace believed natural selection could not explain intelligence or morality in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of man could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate “in the unseen universe of spirit”.

Robert Broom in his book The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design? (1933) claimed that ""spiritual agencies"" had guided evolution as animals and plants were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and psychics are capable of seeing them. Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of Homo sapiens is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom ""Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in.

The Anglo-American position recalls (and is presumably inspired by) 18th century concepts regarding the temporalization of The Great Chain of Being. Spiritual evolution, rather than being a physical (or physico-spiritual) process is based on the idea of realms or stages through which the soul or spirit passes in a non-temporal, qualitative way. This is still an important part of some spiritualist ideas today, and is similar to some mainline (as opposed to fundamentalist) Protestant Christian beliefs, according to which after death the person goes to ""summerland"" (see Spirit world)

Theosophical conceptions

Theosophy presents a more sophisticated and complex cosmology than Spiritualism, although coming out of the same general milieu. H. P. Blavatsky developed a highly original cosmology, according to which the human race (both collectively and through the succession of individual reincarnation and spiritual evolution) passes through a number of Root Races, beginning with the huge ethereal and mindless Polarian or First Root Race, through the Lemurian (3rd), Atlantean (4th) and our present ""Aryan"" 5th Race. This will give rise to a future, Post-Aryan 6th Root Race of highly spiritual and enlightened beings that will arise in Baja California in the 28th century, and an even more sublime 7th Root Race, before ascending to totally superhuman and cosmic states of existence.

Blavatsky's ideas were further developed by her successors, such as C.W. Leadbeater, Rudolf Steiner, Alice Bailey, Benjamin Creme, and Victor Skumin each of whom went into huge detail in constructing baroque cycles of rounds, races, and sub-races. 
Skumin elaborated on the theosophical conceptions of spiritual evolution and proposed (1990) a classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: spiritual man), the sixth root race, consisting of eight subraces: HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis. According to Skumin:
Anabiosis spiritalis is spirituality in the potential of unmanifest accumulations of personality, the charge of the fires of spiritual creation;
Scientella spiritalis is the cordial presentiment of the presence and demands of the spirit, spiritualization of the fire of centers, glimpses of self-consciousness of a spiritual person; 
Aurora spiritalis is the imperative of the spirit, the action of the spiritual fire of the centers in the heart, the kindling of the fire of the spirit, the formation of the orientation of the personality to the spiritual improvement of life; 
Ascensus spiritalis is the dawn of spiritual aspirations, the action of the fire of the spirit in the heart, searching spiritual work, aspiration of self-consciousness to merge with the One Spirit; 
Vocatus spiritalis is the maturation of spiritual accumulations, the purposeful spiritual creation, self-awareness and realization of a person as a warrior of the spirit; 
IIluminatio spiritalis is the beginning of the fiery transmutation, the lighting of the achievement fire; revealing the identity of man - the earthly carrier of the Thoughts of the One Spirit; 
Creatio Spiritalis is the beginning of fiery creation, the action of the fire of achievement in the heart, the  revealing self-consciousness of man as the earthly carrier of the Light of the One Spirit; 
Servitus Spiritalis is the carrying a consciously accepted duty-commission, the synthesis of spirituality in the clarity of knowledge of a fiery man.

Although including elements of the science of her day as well as both eastern and western esoteric thought, Blavatsky rejected the Darwinian idea that man evolved from apes, and most subsequent esotericists followed this lead. Darwinism, with its explanation of evolution through material factors like natural selection and random mutation, does not sit well with many spiritual evolutionists, for whom evolution is initiated or guided by metaphysical principles or is tending towards a final spiritual or divine state.  It is believed by Theosophists that humans are evolving spiritually through a series of esoteric initiations and in the future humans will become esoteric masters themselves as their souls gradually rise upward through the spiritual hierarchy over the course of eons as they reincarnate.

Despite this, recent Theosophists and Anthroposophists have tried to incorporate the facts of geology and paleontology into their cosmology and spiritual evolution (in Anthroposophy Hermann Poppelbaum is a particularly creative thinker in this regard). Some have attempted to equate Lemuria with Gondwanaland, for example. Today all these ideas have little influence outside their specialised followings, but for a time Theosophical concepts were immensely influential.  Theosophy-like teachings also continue today in a group of religions based on Theosophy called the Ascended Master Teachings.

Rosicrucians
Rosicrucians view the world as a training school, which posits that while mistakes are made in life, humans often learn more from mistakes than successes. Suffering is considered as merely the result of error, and the impact of suffering on the consciousness causes humans to be active along other lines which are found to be good, in harmony with nature. Humans are seen as spirits attending the school of life for the purpose of unfolding latent spiritual power, developing themselves from impotence to omnipotence (related also to development from innocence into virtue), reaching the stage of creative gods at the end of mankind's present evolution: Great Day of Manifestation.

This view has been compared with epigenesis, which views the development of plants, animals and fungi as a process in which plants, animals and fungi develop from a seed, spore or egg through a sequence of steps in which cells differentiate and organs form. This conception stands in contrast to preformationism, neoformationism.

In esoteric spirituality epigenesis it is the idea that since the mind was given to the human being, it is the original creative impulse which has been the cause of all of mankind's development. According to this approach, humans build upon that which has already been created, but add new elements because of the activity of the spirit.  Humans have the capacity, therefore, to become creative intelligences—creators. For a human to fulfill this promise, his training should allow for the exercise of originality, which distinguishes creation from imitation. When epigenesis becomes inactive, in the individual or even in a race, evolution ceases and degeneration commences.

Neo-Vedanta

According to Gosling, Swami Vivekananda based most of his cosmological and biological ideas on Samkhya. Influenced by western thought and esotericism, Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo developed a view on reincarnation in which an involution of the Divine into matter takes place, and the person has to evolve over multiple lives until the Divine gains recognition of its true nature and liberation is attained.

Samkhya is one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy; proto-Samkhya ideas can be found in the Upanishads, Jainism, and Buddhism. Samkhya posits two ontological entities, Purusha (witness-consciousness) and prakriti ('nature'), which includes mind, congnition, and the perceived objects). According to Samkhya, when purusha comes into proximity with prakriti it disturbs the equilibrium of prakriti. As a result, a number of successive essences called tattvas evolve from prakriti. The most subtle tattwas emerge first, then progressively grosser ones, each in a particular order, and finally the elements and the organs of sense. Adherents of samkhya-Yoga adhere to the release of purusha from prakriti, and the return of prakriti to the unmanifest condition.

Sri Aurobindo and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin both describe a progression from inanimate matter to a future state of Divine consciousness. Teilhard de Chardin refers to this as the Omega Point, and Sri Aurobindo as the Supermind.

Teilhard, who was a Jesuit Paleontologist who played an important role in the discovery of Peking Man, presented a teleological view of planetary and cosmic evolution, according to which the formation of atoms, molecules and inanimate matter is followed by the development of the biosphere and organic evolution, then the appearance of man and the noosphere as the total envelope of human thought. According to Teilhard evolution does not cease here but continues on to its culmination and unification in the Omega Point, which he identifies with Christ.

New Age
New Age thought is strongly syncretic. A common theme is the evolution or the transcendence of the human or collective planetary consciousness in a higher state or higher ""vibratory"" (a metaphor taken from G. I. Gurdjieff) level.

David Spangler's communications speak of a ""New Heaven and a new Earth"", while Christopher Hills refers (perhaps influenced by Sri Aurobindo) to
the divinization of man.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull narrated the idea of evolution in a fascinating fashion. James Redfield in his novel The Celestine Prophecy suggested that through experiencing a series of personal spiritual insights, humanity is becoming aware of the connection between our evolution and the Divine. More recently in his book God and the Evolving Universe: The Next Step in Personal Evolution (2002) co-written with Michael Murphy, he claims that humanity is on the verge of undergoing a change in consciousness.

It is also known as the path of Ascension.

Stage theory
The idea of a spiritual evolution finds contemporary expression in a number of stage theories, inspired by Sri Aurobindo, Jean Gebser, and Piaget, among others. In these models, human development, both individual and collectively, is conceptualized as going through a number of structural stages, from the primitive psychophysical genesis to the full-grown rational, cognitive and moral abilities, and beyond to transpersonal stages in which unconscious drives are fully recognized and integrated, and the sense of a separate identity is loosened or abandoned.

Jean Gebser

Spiral dynamics

An interpretation of social and psychological development that could also be considered a theory of spiritual evolution is spiral dynamics, based on the work of Clare W. Graves. Spiral Dynamics posits a series of stages through which human's cultural development progresses – from a survival-based hunter-gatherer stage to a magical-tribal-agrarian stage to a city-building-invading stage to a mythic-religious-empire stage to a rational-scientific-capitalist stage to a green-holistic-inclusive stage and then ascending to a second tier where all the previous stages are contemplated and integrated and a third transpersonal tier where a spiritual unity or Omega point is eventually reached, which all the other stages are struggling to embody. He feels that individuals in each of the meme-plexes/stages can ascend to the peak of consciousness – these being the prophets, visionaries and leaders of any region/age.

Ken Wilber
More recently the concept of spiritual evolution has been given a sort of respectability it has not had since the early 19th century through the work of the integral theorist Ken Wilber, in whose writings both the cosmological and the personal dimensions are described. In this integral philosophy (inspired in part by the works of Plotinus, Hegel, Sri Aurobindo, Eric Jantsch, and many others) reality is said to consist of several realms or stages, including more than one of the following: the physical, the vital, the psychic, (after the Greek psyche, ""soul""), the causal (referring to ""that which causes, or gives rise to, the manifest world""), and the ultimate (or non-dual), through which the individual progressively evolves. Although this schema is derived in large part from Tibetan Buddhism, Wilber argues (and uses many tables of diagrams to show) that these same levels of being are common to all wisdom teachings. Described simplistically, Wilber sees humans developing through several stages, including magic, mythic, pluralistic, and holistic mentalities. But he also sees cultures as developing through these stages. And, much like Hegel, he sees this development of individuals and cultures as the evolution of existence itself. Wilber has also teamed up with Don Beck to integrate Spiral Dynamics into his own Integral philosophy, and vice versa.

It stars Jon Voight as Billy Flynn, a past boxer with custody of his son Timothy (Ricky Schroder) who attempts to support his son and make up with his former wife Annie (Faye Dunaway) by fighting in the ring again. It is also the final film for actress Joan Blondell to be released during her lifetime.  The film was released on DVD on May 5, 2015, as part of the Warner Archive Collection.

Plot 
Ex-boxing champion Billy Flynn (Jon Voight) lives in the city of Hialeah, Florida, trying to settle down as a horse trainer after giving up his boxing title. A boxer propositions that Billy enter a match with him in the future. Billy shows up at the gym with his son Timothy Joseph ""T.J."" (Ricky Schroder), who calls his father ""Champ"" as a nickname. When he learns the man has not arrived, Billy angrily storms out of the gym, leaving his son behind. T.J. later finds him drunk inside of a bar. When he takes him home, neighbor Josie (Mary Jo Catlett) asks about his drunken state on the street; T.J. tells her that Charlie (Stefan Gierasch) and his friends bought him four beers as a celebration.

The next morning, Billy announces that he won $6,400 gambling and uses it to buy T.J. his own horse named ""She’s A Lady.”  Lady is entered in a race, but suddenly collapses, scraping her leg. Annie, (Faye Dunaway) Billy's wife whom he separated from seven years ago, had placed a bet on the horse beforehand and arrives after Lady's fall. Billy explains to Annie that he told T.J. she was dead, and that she deserted them, but she invites T.J. to her cruise ship where she and T.J. play together.

Annie's current husband (Arthur Hill) confronts Billy to convince him to tell T.J. that Annie is his mother. Billy tells him that since she wasn't there for him, he has no mother. Billy loses a gamble on T.J.'s horse and is told by Whitey (Allan Miller) to either give him Lady or $2,000 in cash. Annie gives Billy the money; however, Whitey decides to take the horse instead. After assaulting Whitey in response and attacking anyone who tries to stop him, including a police officer, Billy is arrested and put into custody, where he tells T.J. that he is to live with Annie. T.J. refuses to leave, and Billy slaps him in a fit of rage. Dumbstruck, T.J. leaves.
At her home, Annie tries to comfort T.J., but accidentally tells him she is indeed his mother. T.J. refuses to accept her as his mother due to her absence; Annie leaves the room, distraught.

Billy is released; he hugs T.J. at a stadium and says he won't leave him ever again. Billy later wakes up in the middle of the night before Annie visits Billy and says she wants him to explain why she wasn't there for T.J. After a fight, Billy allows her back into his life as a friend. To make it up to his son, Billy explains his promise to fight in the ring after Jackie (Jack Warden) warns him about his age and constant headaches, explaining how they could be fatal when boxing. Jackie reluctantly agrees to train Billy to fight again.

The night of the fight arrives. From his dressing room, T.J. sees that Billy's opponent (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb) is much stronger than Billy, prompting worry. This is diverted, however, when they see Annie in the arena.
Billy wins the first two rounds, but later receives many blows to the head, and is weakened. The doctor looks at Billy during break, then explains that if he gets worse the fight will have to stop. Billy continues to get badly hurt, but gets his second wind and wins by K.O. Billy faints as he's being taken back to his dressing room; he calls for T.J., then asks if he's happy that Billy won. T.J. confirms this, telling him ""The Champ always comes through"". Billy dies. T.J., unaware his father is dead, yells at him to wake up. He is told by Jackie that Billy is gone, and is distraught until Annie arrives, who is also saddened by Billy's death. T.J. says goodbye to Billy, then enters an embrace in Annie's arms.

Production 
Director Franco Zeffirelli said he was inspired to remake the original film after seeing it again on television; it had first made an impression on him as a child because of the parallels between his own troubled youth and that of the boy in the story. Robert Redford turned down the lead role. Ryan O'Neal signed to play the lead, but he wanted his son Griffin to play his co-star. The director refused, claiming Griffin was too old, so O'Neal pulled out of the film. The filmmakers conducted a six-month talent search with thousands of applicants to cast the role of T.J.; Ricky Schroder was chosen immediately after his audition.

Reception

Critical response 
On Rotten Tomatoes the movie has an approval rating of 38% rating, based on 24 reviews and an average rating of 5/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"". Michael Booth from The Denver Post spoke positively of the film: ""Director Franco Zeffirelli makes beautiful pictures; from Shakespeare to the life of St. Francis. In “The Champ,” he imbues Florida with some oldtime movie magic, retelling the tale of a washed-up former boxer trying to shed booze and gambling to win back his son."" Kevin Fiddler of the now defunct Henderson Home News praised the acting by briefly saying ""Great performance from Jon Voight and Rick Schroeder.""

Time Out London was critical of the film, calling it ""A pointless update of King Vidor's '30s weepie."" Writing for The New York Times, Critic Vincent Canby intensely panned the film, stating that ""the most offputting thing about such canny, tear-stained movies as 'The Champ' is not their naïveté but their unholy sophistication. These movies don't mean to deal with the world as it really is, but as it should be, a place where there's no pile-up of emotional garbage too big that it can't be washed clean by a good cry. My problem with 'The Champ' is that I didn't cry. The garbage accumulated.""

A positive review from Dale Pollock in Variety stated, ""Hardly anyone can resist a cute kid, and with Ricky Schroder, 'The Champ' has the most irresistible moppet seen on the screen in decades. Franco Zeffirelli makes an auspicious debut on these shores with his first American film, bolstered by earnest performances from Jon Voight and Faye Dunaway.""

Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and questioned the point of remaking the original, adding, ""Of course that question would be of secondary importance if 'The Champ' were an effective tearjerker. But it's not. For no apparent reason, the original simple story has been lengthened a full 35 minutes. With catastrophe now piled upon catastrophe, 'The Champ' seems to be begging us to cry.""

Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote in a generally positive review that ""Zeffirelli has made 'The Champ' work again, on his and its extravagant terms. It requires, makes no mistake, a willing surrender to those terms of sentimental romance and is less piquantly seasoned with wry worldliness than 'Heaven Can Wait,' for example, whose romantic idealism it shares. But, with due allowances, 'The Champ' is a strongly affecting experience for those who want to be moved.""

Gary Arnold of The Washington Post opined that the film ""slogs on for about two reels too many, concluding on a note of utterly contrived tragedy that should make just about everyone feel wretchedly deceived.""

Clyde Jeavons of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, ""Whether the unabashed sentimentality of Zeffirelli's remake of King Vidor's 1931 was deliberate or a misinterpretation of mood, one thing is certain; rarely has the screen been quite so awash with tears for so little apparent reason.""

Movie historian Leonard Maltin gave the picture 1.5 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it ""Hopeless...Voight acts too smart for us to believe he's a dumb pug, while Dunaway acts as if she wants to bed down with their kid; Schroeder cries (and cries) convincingly, but this still isn't exactly Zeffirelli's finest hour.""

The film has also been called ""one of the most depressing movies"", and the final scene has been used in psychology experiments to elicit a strong emotional response. According to Smithsonian magazine two psychologists, Robert Levenson and James Gross, conducted a study of more than 250 movie clips, and subjected them to 500 subjects in 1988, and concluded the last three minutes of the movie, where ""T.J."" sees his father win in his comeback fight only to witness his death in the dressing room afterwards, elicited the saddest response from a majority of the subjects. In the scene the grief-stricken ""T.J."" is inconsolable tugging his father's body while crying out ""Champ, wake up. Please wake up, Champ.""

Box office 
The film got off to a moderate start but retained holding and growing power and was MGM's biggest international hit in 14 years, grossing $30.4 million in the United States and Canada and over $35 million overseas, including more than $10 million in Japan.  By September 1979, it was MGM's fourth biggest ever hit.

Awards 
Schroder won the Golden Globe Award for ""Best New Male Star of the Year in a Motion Picture"" at age nine for his performance as T.J. Flynn. Voight was a nominee for Best Actor but lost out to Dustin Hoffman for his role in Kramer vs. Kramer.

Dave Grusin's score was nominated for an Oscar at the 52nd Academy Awards.

360,387317,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susitna%20River,Susitna River,"The Susitna River (; ; ) is a  long river in the Southcentral Alaska. It is the 15th largest river in the United States, ranked by average discharge volume at its mouth. The river stretches from the Susitna Glacier to Cook Inlet's Knik Arm.

Etymology and history 
The Susitna River was named by the Dena'ina Alaska Native people meaning ""sandy river"" (). The river appears to have been first explored by outsiders in 1834 by a ""Creole [Indian] named Malakov"" and the name may have been obtained by the Russians at that time, recorded by the Russia Hydrography Department on chart 1378 dated 1847 as  () ""Sushitna River"". The present spelling of the name has evolved due to euphemistic reasons. The 1890 census reported that Susitna Village on the east bank of the river had 146 Kenai Natives and 27 houses.

Description
The Susitna River heads at Susitna Glacier, in Alaska Range, flows southwest to Cook Inlet,  west of Anchorage, Alaska Cook Inlet Low.

There are several rivers flowing into the Susitna River including East Fork Susitna River and West Fork Susitna River. The Little Susitna River is a separate river system which flows into the Cook Inlet on the other side of Susitna Flats.

The Susitna along with the Matanuska River, drains the broad Matanuska-Susitna Valley south of the Alaska Range.

It rises in the Susitna Glacier on Mount Hayes in the Alaska Range near . It flows in winding course generally southwest to Curry, then south, along the west side of the Talkeetna Mountains, past Talkeetna, Chulitna River, and Susitna, and drains into Cook Inlet approximately 25 miles (40 km) west of Anchorage. 

It receives the Yentna River from the northwest approximately 5 miles (8 km) north of Susitna. It is navigable to 85 mile (137 km) upstream from its mouth to Talkeetna. Valdez Creek, notable for its 1903 gold mining, is one of the small headwater tributaries of Susitna River.

The Susitna River is one of Southcentral Alaska's premier sport fishing streams, with significant runs of Chinook and Coho salmon, along with resident grayling, burbot, and rainbow trout. Located within a roadless area, access to the river is difficult and is made usually by power boat or by floatplane. 

Matanuska-Susitna Borough owns much of the land along the Susitna and Deshka Rivers. The impacts of summer recreational use and tourists have caused loss of riparian vegetation and bank erosion along the Deshka River's lower reaches, which has been partially remedied through a restoration project in the summer of 2002. However, the borough currently lacks either regulations to prevent further damage or the means to enforce such regulations.

Location
Susitna River is on the North side of Cook Inlet  North-East of North Foreland. Mount Susitna, a prominent landmark along the upper part of the inlet, is about  West of the Susitna River at a point  above the mouth.

The channels across the flats at the mouth of Susitna River have depths of  or less at low water and change during the winter and spring because of ice and freshet action. The channels above the mouth are said to change frequently in the spring and early summer.

Launches navigate Susitna River to Yentna River, about  above Cook Inlet, thence run occasionally up the Yentna River to the forks about  from the Susitna River. The tides are not felt more than  from the inlet, and above this the current is swift. Overhead power cables with a least clearance of  cross the Susitna River about  above its mouth.

Alexander, Alaska is a small settlement on the west side of Susitna River  above the mouth. Susitna, Alaska is on the East side  above the mouth and just below the mouth of the Yentna River; launches run to and from Anchorage, Alaska. Mail is delivered to both settlements twice monthly by airplane from Anchorage, Alaska.

Susitna Flats lie between big Susitna River and Little Susitna River and to the East of the latter.

Susitna Flats Light (),  above the water, is shown from a skeleton tower and is equipped with a racon.

Little Susitna River,  West of Point MacKenzie, is said to be navigable for landing craft and skiffs at high water for about .

The depths offshore and in the approach to Little Susitna River are subject to drastic and continual change.

Bridges
The Susitna River Bridge is a railroad bridge of the Alaska Railroad in south-central Alaska. It spans the Susitna River on the eastern edge of Denali State Park near Gold Creek. The bridge is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Construction of the bridge took place from October 1920 to February 1921. The span is 503 ft., with a height of 71 ft. in the center; the steel weighs 2,000 tons, and rests on two concrete piers, each 50 ft. high and 70 x 40 ft. in cross-section, and each containing 1,500 cubic yards of concrete. The location was chosen, just downstream of a curve, after observing the pattern of ice jams through the preceding three years.

Ice
Between approximately October 19 and November 14 the Susitna River ices or freezes over for the winter.
 Between April 12 and May 10 the ice breaks-up for the summer.

361,68482603,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazzini,Bazzini,"Bazzini, also known as the A. L. Bazzini Company, and Bazzini Brothers, is a nut, fruit, and chocolate company. Founded in New York City in 1886, it is the oldest nut company in the United States. From its beginning until 1968, it was based on Park Place in the Washington Market neighborhood, part of what is now Tribeca. It moved to a large nut processing facility on Greenwich Street until 1997, when it moved to the Bronx, and later to Allentown, Pennsylvania.

History 
Anthony L. Bazzini, an Italian immigrant, started the company in 1886, selling nuts to businesses and individuals. It was based on Park Place until 1968, when the Washington Market was demolished amid urban renewal programs. Most other food wholesalers moved up to the Bronx, but Bazzini already owned a six-story brick building at nearby 339 Greenwich Street, so moved operations there.

As of 1976, the company processed 3,000 tons of peanuts out of the New York facility. The nuts came from Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia to be roasted in the shell or shelled, blanched, and either oil or dry-roasted. It also processed Brazil nuts, cashews, pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, and pecans.

The company has had arrangements with large venues in New York, like the Madison Square Garden, Shea Stadium, and Yankee Stadium. It has supplied Yankee Stadium since it opened in 1923, and continues to do so as of 2017. It also distributed to a number of retail shops like Zabar's.

The New York Times wrote an article about how Bazzini benefitted from Jimmy Carter's association with peanuts, and called it ""one of the largest packers and distributors of nuts in America"".

Rocco Damato and partners bought the company from the Bazzini family in 1983. In the 1980s, due to the increased expense of operating in Manhattan, the company sold some space in the Greenwich Street building to condominium developers, but retained the retail space on the first floor. Rocco and Electra Damato operated the nut store which had been there since the company moved in, but expanded it to include gourmet food and a cafe. They moved some production to North Carolina before deciding to move completely. In 1997, Bazzini moved its main nut processing facility from Tribeca to Hunts Point in the Bronx, leaving the retail store behind on Greenwich Street. It was one of the last food companies left in a neighborhood that had been known for wholesale food manufacturing.

It acquired Barton's chocolate company in 2011. The same year, the company factory moved again, this time to Allentown, Pennsylvania. Damato attributed the decision to the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act, a law which gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new authorities to regulate the way foods are grown, harvested and processed. He said it would require tens of millions of dollars in upgrades to the Bronx facility to come up to code. They opted to move to Allentown because it already owned a more modern facility there after its purchase of Barton's. After the move, it retained offices and distribution in New York City.

The company's trademark is a happy elephant holding a big peanut. As of 2017, it is the oldest nut company in the United States.

Bazzini Building 

The large nut processing building which operated at 339 Greenwich Street, at the intersection with Jay Street, is still known as the Bazzini Building.

It was initially built for John H. Mohlmann, who owned a successful grocery business which operated in the Washington Market neighborhood and purchased several buildings in the area. After he died, his estate combined four lots to construct a large, six-story building. It was designed by C. Wilson Atkins in Renaissance and Romanesque Revival styles. The Greenwich Street side is slightly taller, but the Jay Street facade has larger arches.

The Mohlmann family operated a wholesale grocery out of part of the space, while other businesses leased the rest. A large number of businesses, mostly food wholesalers, operated out of the building in the first half of the 20th century. Bazzini purchased it, along with adjacent buildings, in 1943, even while maintaining their business operations in Park Place and continuing to rent out to others. When their business was forced out of Park Place, they moved to Greenwich Street.

Though Bazzini left Tribeca in 1997, the large nut processing building remains, converted into condominiums. It is part of the Tribeca West Historic District, designated May 7, 1991. The Damatos' retail store in the former Bazzini building closed in 2010.

It is approximately  long and flows through Lewis Township and West Buffalo Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . A few streams in its watershed are designated as impaired due to nutrients and siltation. The watershed mostly consists of agricultural and forested land. Wild trout occur within the stream.

Course
Coal Run begins near a valley in Lewis Township. It flows southeast for several tenths of a mile before entering West Buffalo Township. Immediately upon entering that township, the stream turns east-southeast for several tenths of a mile, receiving one unnamed tributary from the left. It then flows east for a few miles, receiving three more unnamed tributaries from the left. After a while, it turns east-southeast for a few tenths of a mile before turning east again and receiving another unnamed tributary from the left. The stream then flows east-northeast for several tenths of a mile until it reaches its confluence with North Branch Buffalo Creek.

Coal Run joins North Branch Buffalo Creek  upstream of its mouth.

Tributaries
Coal Run has no named tributaries. However, it has a number of unnamed tributaries. The stream codes of these unnamed tributaries include 19039, 19041, and 19042.

Hydrology

Overview

Colonial-era writers such as Louis-Marie Pouka and Sankie Maimo were educated by European missionary societies and advocated assimilation into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world. Jean-Louis Njemba Medu was a pioneering writer who published the science fiction novel Nnanga Kon in the Bulu language as early as 1932. After World War II, writers such as Mongo Beti and Ferdinand Oyono analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation. Other older generation writers include Guillaume Oyônô Mbia, Mbella Sonne Dipoko, Francis Bebey, René Philombé and kenjo Jumbam.

Some critically acclaimed writers include Marcien Towa, Imbolo Mbue, Patrice Nganang, Calixthe Beyala, Bate Besong, Gaston-Paul Effa, Werewere Liking, Ba'bila Mutia, John Nkemngong Nkengasong, Bole Butake, Leonora Miano, Francis B Nyamnjoh and Linus T. Asong.

In 2014, Imbolo Mbue signed a million dollar deal with Random House for her debut manuscript. The novel titled Behold the Dreamers follows the travails of a Cameroonian immigrant and a Lehman Brothers executive during the 2008 financial crisis.

Literary awards
International and bilingual English-and-French literary prizes, Grand Prix of Literary Associations (GPLA), were launched in Cameroon in 2013, and are to date the main literary awards in Cameroon. They have already contributed to unveil or confirm many gifted authors, such as Eric Mendi, twice winner in the Belles-Lettres Category, Charles Salé, Fiston Mwanza Mujila, Felwine Sarr, to name a few. The GPLA also pay tribute to deceased authors through the Grand prix de la mémoire, which was awarded to late Cameroonian author Sankie Maimo in the last edition (GPLA 2016).

They consisted of sub-groups or clans, including Jeraruk, Rankbirit and Wilu, and have been referred to as Meru people, which was a larger grouping which could also include the Ngawait and Ngaiawang peoples.

Language

The Erawirung appear to have spoken a dialect of the Yuyu language common to their neighbours. This language group is alternatively called the Meru language group, and is included under this name on the AIATSIS Language Map.

Country
According to Norman Tindale, Erawirung traditional lands covered about , around the eastern bank of the Murray River, reaching from north of Paringa past Loxton into the sandy stretches some  to its south. Their western boundary reached from Rufus Creek into the vicinity of the Overland Corner.

Social organisation and economy
The Erawirung were divided into hordes, of which the following are known:
 Jeraruk
 Rankbirit (totem = eaglehawk)
 Wilu

They practiced circumcision alone, but not dental avulsion in initiation rites.

chert mining in two of their localities, at Springcart Gully and at a site south of Renmark formed an important element of the Erawirung economy, and the areas were jealously defended from neighbouring tribes.

History
Early ethnographers often classified the small Erawirung tribe as one of a collective group named the Meru people. The Erawirung had slipped from the memory of the nearby Jarildekald by the time Ronald Murray Berndt interviewed the latter in the late 1930s-early 1940s.

He appeared on 1960s TV pop shows, Sing! Sing! Sing! and Bandstand. From March 1962, at age 17, he became the youngest person in Australia to host their own TV show, The Bryan Davies Show. The singer issued two albums, On My Way (1965) and Together by Myself (1968). His most popular singles were, ""Dream Girl"" (July 1961) and ""Five Foot Two Eyes of Blue"" (October), which both reached the top 4 on the Sydney charts.

Biography 

Bryan Davies was born in Manchester in 1944. At the age of four his family migrated to Sydney. His father, Norman R Davies, was an analytical chemistry lecturer at the University of New South Wales, his mother was a former dancer. His first TV appearance was on teen music show, Teen Time, on 27 September 1960, while he was a student at Canterbury Boys' High School. He left in the following year and was signed by the HMV label.

Davies first hit single, a cover version of Mark Wynter's ""Dream Girl"", reached No. 1 in Sydney in July 1961. He also appeared on 1960s TV pop shows, Sing! Sing! Sing! and Bandstand (from 1961). His second hit was ""Five Foot Two Eyes of Blue"" (October 1961), which reached No. 4 in Sydney. It was originally performed by the California Ramblers in 1925 as ""Has Anybody Seen My Gal?"". His other popular singles were, ""I Don't Like to Be Alone"", ""Love and Money"" and ""Ten Pin Bowling"" (July 1962).

At age 17 Davies became the youngest person in Australia to host his or her own TV show, The Bryan Davies Show, from March 1962. Regular guests were Neil Williams, Judy Cannon and the Don Burrows Sextet. It was broadcast for 75 episodes on ABC TV, directed by Lloyd Brydon and finished in December of the following year. Resident female singer, Coral Kelly, later became a scriptwriter.

From December 1963 to January 1964 Davies appeared in Once upon a Surfie, a youth oriented musical, at the Palace Theatre, Sydney with his then-girlfriend, Jacki Weaver, as well as the Delltones, Dig Richards, Lucky Starr, Rob E G, and Jay Justin. It was written by Bill Watson, and centred on the antics of Gadget, portrayed by Weaver, ""a snooty surfing girl whom the rest of the cast are intent on bringing down a peg or two."" It was a parody of the then-popular Sandra Dee Gidget films. Jay Justin was a song writer who provided Davies with material.

In 1963 Davies met Norrie Paramour, a British composer, producer and conductor, who was impressed with the singer's work and was encouraged to return to England in February 1964. In May that year he recorded with Paramour producing. Davies returned to Australia in October and ""adopted a more Beatles-influenced style and appearance."" In February 1967 he re-entered the Sydney charts top 20 with ""Alberta"", his last hit recording. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, ""by the late 1960s Davies had moved into cabaret and television work.""

Davies took up acting and hosting roles for TV shows and was a cast member on The Mavis Bramston Show (1964–68), and featured in 7 Network's Anything Goes (1968) with Nancye Hayes, Reg Livermore and Johnny Lockwood. In July 1979 he took the role of Sebastian in Your Own Thing at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne. He had a guest role in a Matlock Police episode, ""What's in It for Me"" (1973). In 1981 Davies was the presenter of a short-lived Candid Camera-styled game show, Catch Us If You Can.

Davies worked in The Johnny O'Keefe Memorial Show, alongside other singers from that era including Alan Dale, Vicki Forrest, Barry Stanton and Johnny Devlin. He later performed with Roland Storm and Lucky Starr in the Golden Boys of Aussie Rock 'n' Roll show. In 1994 Davies had a minor role, as the Barman, in the biographical feature film, Sirens.

Personal life 

Bryan Davies dated aspiring actress, Jacki Weaver, from late 1962 after meeting while both performed in a Christmas pantomime, A Wish Is a Dream, at the Phillip Theatre, Sydney. In May 1964 Davies was in London and described to Betty Best of The Australian Women's Weekly how, ""[Weaver] wants to be an actress, so perhaps when she finishes school this year she might come over to London with her mother to try her luck."" Upon his return in October, Weaver observed, ""I never liked Bryan's brushed-back hairstyle before, and was always trying to get him to grow it and brush it down at the front... I think it's great now. And I love all his new clothes – the high-collared shirts, square-toed leather boots, and especially the three-piece suit.""

By November 1975 Davies was married to Tracy and the couple had two children.

372,59660028,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron%20Zalkind,Aron Zalkind,"Aron Borissovich Zalkind (1888–1936) was a Russian psychologist.

Life
He was born in Kharkiv, and became a student of Vladimir Serbsky. Before World War I he developed an interest in the theories of Alfred Adler.

Originally trained as a psychoanalyst, Zalkind was involved in an attempt to promote ""Freudism"" as an interpretation of psychoanalysis compatible with Marxism-Leninism. When this proved politically impossible, he became an advocate of paedology and when he took over as Director of the Psychological Institute of Moscow it was renamed the Institute of Psychology, Paedology and Industrial Psychology.

Works
His most famous text was The Twelve Sexual Commandments of the Revolutionary Proletariat (1925). Here Zalkind argues for sexual abstinence.

In 1928 with Ernst Kolman he edited Life and Technology of the Future: Social and Scientific-Technical Utopias, an anthology of various historic utopian texts supplemented by six texts written by the contemporary Soviet intellectuals. Whereas the first five of these depict non-political technocratic utopias, the sixth, by Zalkind, entitled ""The Psychology of the Future Man (Socio-Psychological Study)"" was more critical: Zalkind criticised previous utopian writers for their inability to realise their utopias, something which could at that time be overcome, he claimed, thanks to the scientific nature of Marxism-Leninism. He then described a future where social environment would be transformed by a “mature Communist” ideology: human body function would alter, women would give birth to children less frequently and would experience easier pregnancies; sexuality would be less “spontaneous” both physically and emotionally. Personal physical instincts would become social instincts; people succumb less frequently to physical and mental exhaustion. However the bodies of future humanity would be smaller and finer, while their life expectancy would be almost infinite.

In 1930 Zalkind wrote a hostile preface to Sigmund Freud's The Future of an Illusion, which was the last of Freud's works to be translated into Russian in the Soviet Era.

Gilbert was born in Plymouth in 1864. His father was a school teacher. Slater studied economics and worked as a professor. In 1909, he was appointed principal of Ruskin College and served from 1909 to 1915. From 1915 to 1921, Slater served as the Professor of Economics at the University of Madras. Slater died in 1938 at the age of 73.

Slater is known for rural developments he initiated in India. Slater is also known for his love for Dravidian culture and civilization and for theorizing that the works of Shakespeare were actually written by several different writers at different times.

Early life 

Slater was born at Plymouth, England on 27 August 1864 to a schoolmaster, Daniel Slater.

Academic career 

Slater graduated in economics and taught the subject as an academic. He wrote one of the first PhDs at the London School of Economics. Enclosure of Common Fields in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries was published in 1905. (LSE Magazine Winter 2010)

Principal of Ruskin College 

Slater served as the Principal of Ruskin College, Oxford from 1909 to 1915.

In India 

In 1915, Slater sailed to India to take over as the first Professor of economics and head of the new economics department of the University of Madras which was founded in 1912. and chaired the economics department of Madras University from 1915 to 1921. Even before he arrived in India, Slater had learnt the Tamil language and was ready for his new assignment. During his tenure, Gilbert and his team performed a detailed survey of the villages in the Madras Presidency and analyzed the prevailing economic conditions. One of the people who assisted Slater in his study was South Indian businessman M. Ct. Muthiah Chettiar. The results of the survey were published in the book Some South Indian Villages. During his tenure, Slater worked hard to eradicate poverty.

Slater also demonstrated a keen interest in the culture and civilization of South India. Back in  England in 1924, he published his book The Dravidian Elements in Indian Culture.

Slater was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council in 1921 and served for a year until his return to the United Kingdom in 1922. During his term in the council, he recommended the appointment of a committee to investigate the feasibility of the adoption of a common script for the whole Presidency. Slater's motion was, however, defeated by a huge margin.

On the choice of medium of instruction, he wrote:

Slater co-authored the book Indigenous Banking in India along with L. C. Jain in 1929.

The Seven Shakespeares 

Back in England, Slater studied Shakespeare and proposed a new variation of theory that the works attributed to Shakespeare were not his. In The Seven Shakespeares (1931) he argued that the works were actually written by seven different authors: Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Sir Walter Raleigh, William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, Christopher Marlowe, Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, and Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland. This so-called ""group theory"" revived Delia Bacon's early model of collaborative authorship and brought together all the most popular recent candidates.

Death 

Slater died on 8 March 1938 at the age of 73. He had married, in 1897, Violet, daughter of Joseph Oakeshott, of East Barnet, and Eliza Maria, née Dodd; she was a sister of the civil servant and Fabian Joseph Francis Oakeshott. 

On 22 January 2009 a portrait of Gilbert Slater was unveiled at the campus of the University of Madras by the Finance Minister of Tamil Nadu, K. Anbazhagan.

376,3437099,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan%20M.%20Newmark,Nathan M. Newmark,"Nathan Mortimore Newmark (September 22, 1910 – January 25, 1981) was an American structural engineer and academic, who is widely considered one of the founding fathers of earthquake engineering. He was awarded the National Medal of Science for engineering.

Early life
Newmark was born in Plainfield, New Jersey to a Jewish couple, Abraham and Mollie Newmark. After receiving his early education in North Carolina and New Jersey, he went on to attend Rutgers University. Newmark graduated from Rutgers in 1930 earning high honors and special honors in civil engineering. He married Anne Cohen in 1931.

Newmark then attended graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he worked under Hardy Cross, Harold M. Westergaard, and Frank E. Richart.

At the University of Illinois
In 1932 he received a M.S. degree and in 1934 a Ph.D. degrees for thesis titled Interaction between rib and superstructure in concrete arch bridges, in civil engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. After graduating from UIUC, Newmark was appointed to many prestigious positions in the department. He became Research Professor of Civil Engineering in 1943. He served as Chairman of the Digital Computer Laboratory of the University from 1947 to 1957 and in 1956 he was appointed head of the Civil Engineering Department and held the position until 1973. Newmark held many important leadership positions and the reputation of the longest tenure on the University Research Board. He continued as a professor there until he retired with a rank of Professor Emeritus. Under his leadership, the program at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign soared to new heights. The civil engineering laboratory on campus now bears his name.

Newmark was the advisor or coadvisor of the following students who completed their Ph.D. in Civil Engineering, Graduate College, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign:

Achievements
During World War II Newmark consulted for the National Defense Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and Development, for which in 1948 he received the President's Certificate of Merit. He served on numerous Department of Defense boards and panels, with major contributions to the Minute Man and MX missile systems.

In 1959, Newmark introduced what became known as the Newmark-beta method of numerical integration used to solve differential equations. The method is still widely used in numerical evaluation of the dynamic response of structures and solids, such as in Finite element analysis.  He later helped to develop the first digital computers, the ILLIAC II, which was one of the first transistorized computers. It was also designed to use transistors that were not even invented yet. The ILLIAC-II eventually led to the development of computer software for engineering.

Another of Newmark's achievements was the Torre Latinoamericana (Latin American Tower) in Mexico City, Mexico, the tallest building in Mexico City until 1984.  Newmark was the consulting engineer on the project.  He designed the building to be supported by the muddy soil underneath the structure and be able to withstand earthquakes. The design was put to the test in 1957 when an earthquake struck the city, and again in the stronger earthquake of 1985. The Torre Latinoamericana withstood the quakes and is still standing today as a witness of progress in earthquake engineering. He also developed the seismic design criteria for other large projects including the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the proposed Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline, and about 70 nuclear power plants.

Throughout his career Newmark developed a simple, yet powerful and widely used method for analyzing complex structural components and assemblies under a variety of conditions of loading and for calculating the stresses and deformations in soil beneath foundations.  He also was an engineer on the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Since there was an oil and energy shortage, high unemployment rate, and high inflation in the 1970s, the country had to do something to help conserve and utilize the natural resources available to them inside the country. Once oil was discovered in Alaska, there was a need for a design to get the oil quickly and efficiently down to the refineries.  The Alaskan terrain offered many diverse challenges for a normal underground pipeline, thus Newmark was consulted to design sections of the pipeline near the fault lines. Since Newmark had done numerous studies on the effect of earthquakes on structures, he had the ideal background to tackle such a revolutionary feat.

Newmark also made significant contributions to geotechnical engineering. He developed a new method, named after him (Newmark's sliding block method)  of calculating displacements in earth dams and slopes due to earthquakes. His work was acknowledged with an invitation to deliver the 5th Rankine Lecture of the British Geotechnical Association, entitled Effects of earthquakes on dams and embankments.

The American Concrete Institute awarded Newmark the Wason Medal for Most Meritorious Paper in 1950. In 1968, he was recipient of the National Medal of Science for Engineering Sciences.  He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962), and received the 1979 John Fritz Medal and several other awards. The American Society of Civil Engineers has named a medal after him, which is awarded ""to a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers who, through contributions in structural mechanics, has helped substantially to strengthen the scientific base of structural engineering."" In 1964 he contributed to the founding the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and two years later became a member of National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Hardy Cross
Hardy Cross, who Newmark worked under at the University of Illinois in Urbana, developed the moment distribution method. It enabled designers to calculate statically indeterminate frames of reinforced concrete.  Newmark looked up to Cross; in Cross's book Arches, Continuous Frames, Columns and Conduits, Newmark wrote the introduction, in which he tells how much he enjoyed the classes taught by Cross and how they would sometimes walk home together after classes and discuss engineering principles.

Originally a dual-purpose decoration for bravery and for outstanding service, it was converted into an award for senior officers only in 1979. Recipients were entitled to use the post-nominal letters SOO, standing for Stella Officii Optimi, the Latin form of the name.

Instituted on 20 May 1963, retrospective to 31 May 1961, the SOO superseded the Queen's Police Medal.  It was awarded to all ranks of the South African Police, for particular gallantry, or for outstanding service, resourcefulness, leadership, or sense of responsibility and personal example.

When the SAP awards system was revised in 1979, the SOO was re-defined as a decoration for general officers who had rendered meritorious service promoting the efficiency of the SAP and contributing actively to national security.  A new decoration, the SA Police Star for Outstanding Service, was instituted to replace the SOO's original role.

The SOO is a gold six-pointed multi-rayed star.  On the obverse is a green six-pointed star depicting the ""torch of life"", the ""wings of peace"", and the ""scales of justice"".  The reverse displays the national coat of arms and the words ""Distinguished Service"" and ""Voortreflike Diens"".

The ribbon is white, edged in green and red (left) and orange and blue (right).  In its original form, the decoration was worn on the chest.  In its post-1979 form, it was worn around the neck, and on ceremonial occasions it was worn on a silver-gilt collar instead of the ribbon.

The SOO was discontinued on 1 September 1986.  After that date, police generals were awarded the Order of the Star of South Africa (Non-Military) instead.

Works of Art
To create A Card for J.R. Plaza, Iñaki Bonillas pored over photographs, albums, and slides he inherited from his grandfather, J. R. Plaza. Included in the archive was a sheet of business cards, each corresponding to a position Plaza held during his professional life as a salesman. 

Intermixed among these were eleven cards Plaza designed and typed, representing professions he never held, including borreguero (shepherd) and modelo (model). Inspired by the cards, Bonillas paired several of his grandfather’s self-portraits with the fictitious business cards, playfully exploring Plaza’s interest in self-presentation and constructing a series of new narratives about his own family history. Bonillas also inherited Plaza’s typewriter, which inspired him to create one last business card: “self-portraitist.”

384,19625708,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning%20for%20a%20Cause,Learning for a Cause,"Learning for a Cause is a nonprofit student press founded in 2004 by Canadian educator and photographer Michael Ernest Sweet. The initiative operated from Lester B. Pearson High School in Montreal until autumn 2010 when it merged into Youth Fusion Quebec. Sweet regained control of the imprint in 2014, effectively demerging from Youth Fusion. It continues to intermittently release titles, the most recent in 2018.

Details 
Learning for a Cause aimed to increase and strengthen the social and moral sensibilities in high school students by providing them with genuine opportunities to engage as citizens. The flagship project of the initiative was the Publishing Program which allowed Canadian high school students to write and publish on real-life issues in books, with the goal of inspiring change in their communities. More than 1500 high school students were published and made authors through this initiative.

More noted publications include Down to Earth, a collection of more than 100 high school students writing in response to global warming and environmental destruction. The volume featured guest writers Roberta Bondar and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Down to Earth was endorsed by a number of celebrities including Martin Sheen, David Suzuki, Farley Mowat and Marc Garneau. Columbia University Philosopher Maxine Greene has said that the project ""is a significant opening to possibility"" and legendary Canadian artist Robert Bateman added that ""Learning for a Cause is what every young person should be doing."" Down to Earth was a finalist in two categories at the 2009 World Indie Book Awards.

Other publications include Raising Humanity, which features introductions by actor Martin Sheen and Canada's First Astronaut Marc Garneau. The fifth anniversary compilation edition, FIVE, featured the ""best of the best"" from more than 1000 student writers. This volume was endorsed by Hollywood socialite Candy Spelling who also an introduction to the book. We Who Listened is about Survivor Alex Levin and this book was a finalist for the Governor General's Award for Excellence in Teaching Canadian History in 2011.

The project and its publications have been featured in the Globe and Mail, Montreal Gazette, and Concordia University's papers The Link and The Journal. Features have also appeared in 34th Parallel Magazine and Canadian Teacher. Again in 2009 both Montreal Families Magazine and The Montreal Gazette profiled the project and its new publication Raising Humanity.

Learning for a Cause received a 2006 and 2009 Quebec Entrepreneurial Award and was featured in a Quebec Ministry of Education documentary video. In 2009, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper recognized its founder, Michael Ernest Sweet, with a Prime Minister's Award and again in 2012 with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for his significant contributions to public education in Canada.

Youth Fusion Quebec, a non-profit, non-partisan organization that establishes partnerships between high schools and universities, in an effort to counter high school drop-out rates, will continue the publishing project with the Learning for a Cause imprint beginning in 2011–12.

Michael Ernest Sweet regained control of Learning for a Cause and its imprints in 2014, effectively demerging from Youth Fusion. The press released a new title in 2014, Our Memories, Our History, which features a foreword by former Canadian Prime Minister, Paul Martin. Learning for a Cause ceased operations in late 2014, following ten years of publishing young writers and charting the way for classroom print-on-demand publishing in Canada.

In 2017, Sweet reinstated the student publishing initiative at the Solomon Schechter School of Manhattan, where middle school students published On Democracy, an anthology about the American republic featuring a foreword by actor Martin Sheen.

389,630700,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyageurs%20Cup,Voyageurs Cup,"The Voyageurs Cup () is the domestic trophy for professional soccer in Canada, awarded to the best men's and women's clubs in the country. 

The Cup was conceived and commissioned by fans of the Canada men's national team, the Voyageurs, in 2002. From 2002 to 2007, the cup was awarded annually to the Canadian team finishing with the best record in the USL First Division, from regular-season matches against other Canadian teams in the league. Since 2008, the trophy has been presented to the winner of the Canadian Championship, which also awards Canada's berth in the CONCACAF Champions League. Montreal Impact won the first seven trophies while Toronto FC took the next four. The current men's cup holder is Montreal Impact (CF Montreal), after winning the 2021 Canadian Championship.

History
The Voyageurs Cup was first conceived in March 2002 by fans of the Canada men's national team, known as the Voyageurs, following Canada's surprise success at the 2000 Gold Cup. After years of being promised a domestic Canadian cup by the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA), the Voyageurs took it upon themselves to commission a national trophy using member donations. Veteran Voyageurs member and chief fundraiser since the group's founding in 1996, Dwayne Cole, solicited donations on the Voyageurs internet forum, resulting in $3,500-$4,000 donated. The money was used to commission the trophy, 

The group agreed to award the cup to whichever of the four Canadian clubs in the USL A-League – the Montreal Impact, Vancouver Whitecaps, Toronto Lynx and Calgary Storm – collected the most points against each other during the regular USL season.

Prior to the establishment of the Canadian Premier League, the cup had been contested by the Montreal Impact, Toronto Lynx, the USL and MLS incarnations of the Vancouver Whitecaps, Calgary Storm (later renamed Calgary Mustangs), Edmonton Aviators, Toronto FC, FC Edmonton and Ottawa Fury FC, along with the League1 Ontario and Première Ligue de soccer du Québec champions.

When the CPL launched, its teams were added into the draw, to expand the clubs to include Pacific FC, Cavalry FC, Valour FC, York9 FC, Forge FC and HFX Wanderers. 

The Montreal Impact won the first seven titles, the first six by virtue of their regular-season record in the USL against other Canadian sides. They won the inaugural 2008 Canadian Championship to retain the trophy, their seventh straight Voyageurs Cup victory. Toronto FC won the 2009 Canadian Championship to win the Voyageurs Cup for the first time. The Calgary Storm never finished higher than fourth in the competition while the Edmonton Aviators finished third in their lone appearance in the tournament. Both Alberta teams folded after the 2004 season. The Toronto Lynx finished as runners-up in four of the five years they participated, eventually dropping down to the Premier Development League in 2007 and effectively withdrawing from the competition. As a result, in 2007 the trophy was decided on regular-season USL results between the Montreal Impact and the Vancouver Whitecaps FC.

The cup is awarded by the Voyageurs, who were founded in 1996 as a national organization of fans of Canada men's national soccer team at all age levels. Until 2008, costs associated with the cup, such as engraving, shipping, maintenance, and promotion had been paid for by private donations from individual members of the Voyageurs. In 2008, the trophy was handed over to the Canadian Soccer Association to be presented to the winners of the Canadian Championship. The terms of the agreement were to be reviewed in 2010.

There is also a Voyageurs Cup West for Women and Voyageurs Cup East for Women awarded since 2004. The first Women's Voyageurs Super Cup was contested in 2006.

Past winners

Men's title

2002–2007: USL era
Prior to 2008, the men's title was decided on regular-season matches between Canada's USL A-League/USL First Division sides.

2008–2010: Canadian Championship, round robin format
The inaugural Canadian Championship was held in 2008, with the three Canadian teams spread across MLS (Toronto FC) and the USL First Division (Montreal Impact and Vancouver Whitecaps) each playing four non-League games in a round robin format.

2011–2020: Canadian Championship, knockout format
Beginning with the 2011 tournament, the format was different from previous editions. In 2011, with four teams involved, the tournament was changed to be a home-and-away semi-final round and a similar final round between the winners. Toronto, as reigning champions, were assigned the top seed and were matched with Edmonton, which was assigned the fourth seed as newcomers to the tournament. The two remaining teams, Montreal and Vancouver, faced off in the other semi-final.

Due to pandemic-related travel restriction and scheduling conflicts, the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) announced that the 2020 tournament would consist solely of a single match final to be held between the winner of the head-to-head series between the three Canadian teams from Major League Soccer and the champion of the Canadian Premier League. On March 11, 2021, the Cup final between Toronto FC and Forge FC was postponed indefinitely.

2021: Canadian Championship, knockout format
The competition follows a similar format to the originally proposed 2020 edition with four rounds and regional pairings in the first two rounds. For the first time in the Canadian Championship, each tie will be played as a single-leg fixture.

Located on Santa Monica Bay, it was incorporated on January 18, 1917, and is part of the South Bay Cities Council of Governments. The population was 16,731 at the 2020 census, a .5% increase from 16,654 at the 2010 census.

History

The El Segundo and Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva (or Gabrieleños) Native American tribes thousands of years ago. The area was once a part of Rancho Sausal Redondo (""Round Willow Patch Ranch""). Rancho Sausal Redondo extended from Playa Del Rey in the north to Redondo Beach in the south. Originally a Mexican land grant owned by Antonio Ygnacio Avila, the rancho was later purchased by a Scottish baronet named Sir Robert Burnett. After his return to Scotland, the property was purchased by then-manager of the rancho, Daniel Freeman. Daniel Freeman sold portions of the rancho to several persons. George H. Peck owned the  of land where the Chevron Refinery now sits. Peck also developed land in neighboring El Porto, where a street still bears his name. The city earned its name (""the second"" in Spanish), as it was the site of the second Standard Oil refinery on the West Coast (the first was at Richmond in Northern California), when Standard Oil of California purchased the farm land in 1911. 

The city was incorporated in 1917. The Standard Oil Company was renamed Chevron in 1984. The El Segundo refinery entered its second century of operation in 2011.

Economy

El Segundo has many aviation-related and petroleum-related industries and operations.

The name was adopted in 1911 when Chevron built its second refinery, El Segundo, which is Spanish for ""the Second"". This refinery is controversial for receiving  some of their crude oil from the Amazon region of South America - more than 5,000 barrels per day. In 1928 William Mines, an immigrant from Canada, leased land for a flying field. In 1930, Los Angeles Municipal Airport, later Los Angeles International Airport, opened north of El Segundo; its presence led to the concentration of aerospace and aviation-related firms in the El Segundo area.

Many large aerospace companies have facilities in El Segundo, including Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Wyle Laboratories, the Aerospace Corporation, and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings. The last two are headquartered there. It is also home to the Los Angeles Air Force Base and the Space and Missile Systems Center, which is responsible for space-related acquisition for the military. In addition to the Chevron oil refinery, El Segundo is located next to the Hyperion sewage treatment plant and the El Segundo power plant.

The El Segundo power plant is operated by the American energy company NRG. In an effort to combine sustainable and environmentally friendly techniques with fossil power generation, NRG was to create a new combined cycle power island, providing power for 240,000 households. The new power plant, slated to go online in 2013, was to use two generators: a Siemens gas turbine and an additional steam turbine. Natural gas drives the gas turbine, while the hot exhaust gases generate steam for the steam turbine. The efficiency of the power plant will be increased up to 58%. A huge environmental advantage of this type of power plant is that in combustion, natural gas generates relatively little carbon dioxide compared to other fossil fuels.

The current Boeing factory, the Boeing Satellite Development Center, was originally built by Nash Motors in 1946 and opened in 1948. In 1955, Hughes Aircraft Company purchased the  building; it was converted to build missiles and also served as a test facility.

Design
MV Dittisham Princess is a steel twin-deck passenger vessel.  The main deck is flush, with a short raised foredeck to provide additional seaworthiness.  There is a fully enclosed saloon with bar and toilets on the main deck, with a large open deck on the upper deck along with the wheelhouse, accessed by external stairways both forward and aft.  There are further open passenger decks forward and aft on the main deck.  Her twin engines are located in the hull underneath the passenger accommodation

History
Se was built for G.H. Riddalls and Sons in 1995 to replace the MV Dartmothian.  In 2000 the Riddalls fleet was bought by Dart Pleasure Craft Ltd and she was transferred to their fleet, with her former red hull painted blue.  Despite being the newest ship in the fleet, she appears to see little use.

Livery
When built the MV Diitisham Princess appeared in 'Red Cruisers' Livery, of red hull, white boot topping, green anti-fouling and white superstructure.  She now is painted in 'River Link' Livery of dark blue hull, with St George's Cross flag on the bow, white boot topping, red antifouling, white superstructure with yellow stripe and the words 'River Link'.  Riddalls tried various combinations of red and white for the raised bow section, it is now mainly white, with the blue paint raised slightly from the level of the main deck.

The name ""Trireme"" was taken from a Greek warship designed with three banks of rowers.

Established by Richard Perle and Gerald Hillman, Trireme Partners was a Delaware entity registered in November 2001. One of the firm's major investors was Boeing, which invested US$20 million.

Perle became the subject of controversy in 2003 following a New Yorker article that alleged that Perle had offered to influence American foreign policy in Saudi Arabia in exchange for investment in Trireme.

Trireme Partners completed its business and dissolved in 2005.

History and investors 
Perle set up Trireme Partners in 2001.  Trireme Partners first sought an investment from Boeing in February 2002. Boeing committed to invest $20 million two months later. The company received a $2.5 million investment from Hollinger International Inc. in 2003 which was reportedly never reported to the audit committee.

Criticism 
In March 2003, Perle became embroiled in controversy after The New Yorker published an article by Seymour Hersh describing a meeting between Perle, the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and Saudi businessman Harb Zuhair, in which Perle allegedly offered to influence American foreign policy in Saudi Arabia in exchange for investment in Trireme. The U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General investigated the conflict of interest and determined that Perle did not violate the conflict of interest provision because he was only working eight days per annum at the Defense Department at the time, which was less than the 60 days of service requirement.

409,2147024,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal%20Fury%202,Fatal Fury 2,"Fatal Fury 2, known as  in Japan, is a 1992 fighting video game released by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home platforms, and later ported to several other home systems. It is the sequel to Fatal Fury: King of Fighters (1991) and the second game in the Fatal Fury franchise. Its updated version, Fatal Fury Special, was released in 1993.

The game is notable for introducing Kim Kaphwan, the first Taewondo and the first Korean character in fighting games, and Mai Shiranui, one of SNK's mascots and their primary sex symbol and one of the most well-known female video game characters. Both of them went on to become mainstays in both future Fatal Fury games as well as The King of Fighters series.

Gameplay 

Fatal Fury 2 was the second game in SNK's 100-Mega Shock series, offering improved graphics and gameplay over the original Fatal Fury: King of Fighters. The play controls were modified, this time making full use of the Neo-Geo's four button configuration, by including four attack buttons (Light Punch, Light Kick, Strong Punch, and Strong Kick). The player can also dash back from the opponent to retreat by quickly tapping the lever backwards twice.

The two-plane battle system from the first Fatal Fury has been retained. This time, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously for the ""Plane Move"". The player can also perform a ""Power Attack"" that will knock the opponent to the other plane. When the opponent is on the other plane, the player can press either a punch button to jump towards the opponent with a ""Low Plane Move Attack"" or either a kick button for a ""High Plane Move Attack"". Certain stages have hazards in the background plane, such as electrified wires or a stampede of bulls, and thus the player cannot change planes but can knock the opponent to the other plane to cause extra damage.

Other specialized techniques have been added as well. After the player guards an opponent's attack, they can follow it up with a special counterattack technique known as an ""Evasion Attack"". The player can also taunt the opponent by pressing the Strong Punch button from a distance. Fatal Fury 2 also introduces the ""Desperation Move"" (or ""Fury""), a powerful type of Special Move which causes massive damage that can only be used when the player's life gauge is at 25% and flashing red.

The single-player mode has the player facing against all eight characters (including a clone of the player's character), followed by four non-playable boss characters. After every fourth match, the player will participate in a bonus round for more points.

Plot
This next saga takes place after the ending of the original Fatal Fury, where Geese Howard meets his demise on 13 August 1991 by getting jump kicked from a high rise by the new and undefeated champion of the ""King of Fighters"" tournament ""Terry Bogard"", during a final fight to the death between the two in Geese’s Tower. During the next year in 1992, a muscle-bound, mysterious nobleman becomes the sponsor of the new K.O.F. competition. This time, the rules are now changed such as being one-on-one per fight, and the tournament went from being several Southtown-only street fights to being a series of worldwide combat circuits with fighters both veterans and newcomers from around the globe competing with ambitions of their own, as well as befriending each other. As the single-player mode progresses, the mysterious challenger begins defeating the participants from the first Fatal Fury game, searching for the man responsible for defeating Geese.

Fighters
The character roster consists of eight selectable warriors: Terry, Andy and Joe from the original Fatal Fury, plus five new playable newcomers. After defeating all eight playable characters in the single player tournament (including a clone of the player's character), the player faces four non-playable bosses.

Playable fighters:
 Terry Bogard - an American champion of the King of Fighters from South Town.
 Andy Bogard - Terry's younger brother and fellow ninjutsu practitioner alongside Mai Shiranui.
 Joe Higashi - a Japanese Muay Thai champion, and a friendly rival of the Bogard brothers.
 Big Bear - an Australian face wrestler, formerly a heel wrestler known as Raiden from the previous King of Fighters tournament.
 Jubei Yamada - an elderly Japanese judo sensei once known as ""Yamada the Demon"" during his handsome youth.
 Cheng Sinzan - a greedy and overweight shih-fu of taiji from Taiwan who is seeking to open his own training hall.
 Kim Kaphwan - a taekwondo kwanjang from South Korea, who fights in the name of justice.
 Mai Shiranui - a beautiful kunoichi who is the daughter of the Shiranui ninja clan's leader and is the self-proclaimed ""fiancée"" of Andy.

Bosses:
 Billy Kane - a bojutsu master from the United Kingdom who is seeking revenge on both the Bogard brothers and Joe for the death of Geese.
 Axel Hawk - a retired heavyweight boxing champion seeking to make his comeback.
 Laurence Blood - a former matador who uses a fighting style based on his bullfighting methods.
 Wolfgang Krauser - a German nobleman seeking to defeat the K.O.F. champion who is responsible for Geese's downfall.

Release

Home versions
In addition to the Neo-Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD home versions, a port of Fatal Fury 2 was released for the Sharp X68000 in Japan in 1993, followed by versions for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, PC Engine CD, SNES and Game Boy in early 1994. The SNES and Genesis versions were published by Takara, while the X68000 version, released only in Japan, was published by Mahou Kabushikigaisha (Magical Company). All three versions allow the player to control the four boss characters via their own respective codes. The PC Engine version was published by Hudson Soft only in Japan and was one of the first games to require the Arcade Card add-on. To coincide with the Japanese release of the SNES version, Hori Electric released a special controller called the Fatal Fury 2 Commander which has the power and super power moves of all the game's playable characters programmed in so that they can be triggered with a single button.

The original Neo Geo version of the game was later included in 2006's Fatal Fury: Battle Archive Volume 1 for the PlayStation 2 (with a choice between the original AES and CD soundtrack). It was also made available on the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2008.

The Game Boy version is titled  and was released exclusively in Japan in 1994. This port features ""super deformed"" style graphics and, like the SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Sharp X68000 ports, allows the player to use the four boss characters. However, due to the Game Boy's limited hardware, all voices have been removed, but in their place the characters have speech bubbles when performing a special attack or Desperation Move. This port also features support for the Super Game Boy peripheral for the SNES. In the Game Boy version, the text in the intro, post match dialogue, and character endings are in Japanese, while the character names, game credits, and menus are in English.

Fatal Fury Special

 was developed and published by SNK and originally released for the Neo Geo arcade and home platforms in 1993. It is an updated version of Fatal Fury 2, introducing several changes to the gameplay system while expanding the available character roster.

Reception

Commercial performance
In Japan, Game Machine listed Fatal Fury 2 on their 1 February 1993 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month. It went on to be Japan's second highest-grossing arcade game of 1993, just below Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. In North America, RePlay reported Fatal Fury 2 to be the fourth most-popular arcade game in February 1993, and Play Meter listed Fatal Fury 2 as the thirteenth most-popular arcade game in March 1993.

The Super Famicom (Super NES) version topped the Japanese Famitsu sales chart in December 1993.

Contemporary reviews
Fatal Fury 2 was generally very well-received by Western game critics upon its release. GamePro review of the Neo Geo version praised the ""action-packed"" gameplay, ""Street Fighter-tough"" challenge, ""great"" character graphics and animation, ""slick scrolling"" backgrounds, and ""fantastic"" sound, concluding it to be an ""awesome sequel"" that ""ranks up there with the Numero Uno fighting game"".

GamePro also praised the Genesis version for its six-button controller support and character graphics. They regarded the music as dull but assessed that the game ""faithfully mimics the Neo Geo version and knocks Fatal Fury Genesis out of the ring"". Reviewing the Genesis version, Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) criticized the sound effects but gave the overall assessment that ""all the fighters, all the stages, and extra options not in the arcade (like a speed setting) make this another fine conversion of a Neo Geo title"".

Reviewing the SNES version of the game, EGM called it ""one of the better fighting games ported to the SNES"" and awarded it Game of the Month. GamePro gave the SNES version a more mixed review, comparing it favorably with its predecessor, but stating that the graphics are inferior to the Neo Geo version, the audio is terrible, the controls are unreliable, and the gameplay is unbalanced. The magazine recommended that Fatal Fury fans instead hold out for the upcoming SNES port of Fatal Fury Special, which they felt to be far superior judging by the pre-release version they had seen.

Retrospective reviews

In a retrospective review, Maximum assessed that while still not as strong as Street Fighter II, Fatal Fury 2 was a dramatic improvement over the first game: ""The number of characters selectable had been extended to eight, and all of them received a full complement of moves and fought with a much greater fluidity than in Fatal Fury"". They also noted better background graphics and greater interaction with the scenery. In 2011, Complex ranked Fatal Fury 2 as the 35th best fighting game of all time, largely for introducing Mai Shiranui. Mega magazine ranked the game at #46 on their ""Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time"" in 1994. In 1995, Total! ranked the game 82nd on their Top 100 SNES Games.

416,27289303,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten%20Johnson,Kirsten Johnson,"Kirsten Johnson (born 1965) is an American documentary filmmaker and cinematographer. She is mostly known for her camera work on several well-known feature-length documentaries such as Citizenfour and The Oath. In 2016, she released Cameraperson, a film which consists of various pieces of footage from her decades of work all over the world as a documentary cinematographer. Directed by Johnson herself, Cameraperson went on to be praised for its handling of themes about documentary ethics interwoven with Johnson's personal reflection on her experiences.

Movies that Johnson has either filmed or directed have received numerous nominations and awards over the years, and she is now a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).

Early life
Johnson was raised in Washington State in a Seventh-day Adventist family who placed restrictions on her access to film and television. She had no exposure to the medium until she attended university.

Career

Cinematography 
After graduating from Brown University in 1987 with a BA in Fine Arts and Literature, Johnson entered the filmmaking world in West Africa, where she got her start in both fiction and nonfiction genres. She then studied film in Paris, and went on to be a principal cameraperson for a variety of documentaries, traveling to numerous countries to do so. In total, she has over 40 credits as cinematographer. Including other jobs in the camera and electrical department, she has a total of over 70 credits in different movies. Some of her film credits include Derrida (2002), a documentary on French philosopher Jacques Derrida, the documentary Darfur Now (2006), and Pray the Devil Back to Hell (2008) which won the Tribeca Film Festival Best Documentary. She also worked on The Oath (2010) and Citizenfour (2014), both directed by Laura Poitras. The Oath is about Osama bin Laden's driver, Abu Jandal, for which Johnson won an award from Sundance. Citizenfour, which won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, concerns Edward Snowden and his revelations about the NSA. Johnson has shot films about everything from the Evangelical Christian chastity movement (Virgin Tales, 2012), to terrorism in the Middle East (The Oath). Her cinematography is also featured in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, Academy Award-nominated short Asylum, Emmy-winning Ladies First, and Sundance premiere documentaries Finding North, This Film Is Not Yet Rated, and American Standoff.

Directing 
Johnson has directed 6 films, her most notable being personal collage-style memoir Cameraperson (2016). It captures the connection between the director and the subjects that she had filmed during her years behind the camera. While she worked for 25 years as a cinematographer, she traveled around the world to places such as Bosnia, Darfur, Kabul and Texas. Especially in Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Yemen, she witnessed and captured emotional, sometimes traumatic, events and interviews. She accessed spare footage from the films she shot, and edited portions that were meaningful to her together for the experimental documentary film. Johnson's Cameraperson premiered at Sundance and won Sheffield Doc/Fest's Grand Jury Award in 2016.

In 2015 Johnson released a short film titled The Above. Just like Cameraperson, this film was made up of footage she initially shot for a different film. It focuses on a military surveillance balloon which is flown above the town of Kabul in Afghanistan for unknown reasons. The Above premiered at the New York Film Festival. Additionally, her 1999 film Innocent Until Proven Guilty examines the number of African American men in the U.S. criminal justice system.

Her second documentary, Dick Johnson Is Dead, premiered in 2020 at Sundance Film Festival, where it received a special award for innovation in nonfiction storytelling. The film is a dedication to her father and an exploration of human mortality.

Personal life
Johnson is based in Manhattan where she is an adjunct professor at New York University. Her brother, Kirk Johnson, is the Sant Director of Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Johnson co-parents her twins with a married couple, painter Boris Torres and filmmaker Ira Sachs. She, Sachs, and Torres were in similar social circles, became friends, and decided to have the experience of parenting together. They now live in neighboring apartments in Manhattan, and split the twins' time equally between both parties.

It was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 for costume design.

Plot
Although he is scheduled to wed his boss George Salt's niece that weekend, Amalgamated World Metals vice chairman Cliff Barton is sent to London to conduct a business deal that will enrich the firm. Salt considers him a protege and intends to turn over control of the company to Barton someday, insisting to him that business always comes first.

Cliff must hide the fact from Mr. Carew, who runs the British company, that Salt intends to unscrupulously assume control of the company rather than simply merge with it. While following through on Mrs. Salt's request to drop by her pet London-based charity, Cliff learns that it is operated by an Austrian refugee, and former concentration camp prisoner, named Miriam Linka.

Although his loyalties are with the company, Cliff wants no part of betraying Carew's trust. He also, against all odds, falls in love with Miriam and persuades her to return to America with him to be married. Salt angrily tries to spin the guilt so that it appears Cliff was the one defrauding the British, while accusations fly that Miriam is not only a prostitute but a Communist as well. Cliff is prepared to resign his position rather than give up Miriam, but board member Guy Elliot has investigated Miriam and clears the rumors about her with an Army Intelligence report. Elliot then presses Salt to retire, making Barton chairman as was always planned. Barton is made chairman and leaves on a honeymoon with Miriam.

429,150871,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian%20III%20of%20Denmark,Christian III of Denmark,"Christian III (12 August 1503 – 1 January 1559) reigned as King of Denmark from 1534 and King of Norway from 1537 until his death in 1559. During his reign, Christian formed close ties between the church and the crown. He  established Lutheranism  as the state religion within  his realms as part of the Protestant Reformation.

Childhood 

Christian was the eldest son of the future king, Frederick I of Denmark, and Anna of Brandenburg.  He was born at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig which Frederick I had made as a primary residence. In 1514, when he was just ten years old, Christian's mother died. Four years later, his father remarried to Sophie of Pomerania (1498–1568). In 1523, Frederick I was elected King of Denmark in the place of his cousin, King Christian II of Denmark. The young Prince Christian's first public service after his father became king was gaining the submission of Copenhagen, which stood firm for the fugitive, King Christian II. As stadtholder of the Duchies of Holstein and Schleswig in 1526, and as viceroy of Norway in 1529, Christian III displayed considerable administrative ability.

Religious views 

Christian's earliest teacher,  Wolfgang von Utenhof  (ca. 1495–1542) and his Lutheran tutor, the military general Johann Rantzau (1492–1565), were both zealous reformers who had an influence on the young Prince. At their urging, while traveling in Germany in 1521, he made himself present at the Diet of Worms to hear Martin Luther speak. Luther's arguments intrigued him. The Prince made no secret of his Lutheran views. His outspokenness brought him into conflict, not only with the Roman Catholic  dominated State Council (Rigsraad), but also with his cautious and temporizing father. At his own court at Schleswig, he did his best to introduce the Protestant Reformation, despite the opposition of the bishops. He made the Lutheran Church the State Church of Schleswig-Holstein, with the Church Ordinance of 1528.

Reign as king

Early reign 

After his father's death, in 1533, Christian was proclaimed king at an assembly in Rye, a town in eastern Jutland, in 1534.  The Rigsraad, dominated by Roman Catholic bishops and nobles, refused to accept Duke Christian as king and turned to Count Christopher of Oldenburg in order to restore Christian II to the Danish throne. Christian II had supported both the Roman Catholics and Protestant Reformers at various times. In opposition to King Christian III, Count Christopher was proclaimed regent at the Ringsted Assembly (landsting), and at the Scania Assembly  (landsting) on St Liber's Hill (Sankt Libers hög) near Lund Cathedral. This resulted in a two-year civil war, known as the Count's Feud (Grevens Fejde) from 1534 to 1536, between Protestant and Catholic forces.

Civil War (Count's Feud) 

Count Christopher had the support of most of Zealand, Scania, the Hanseatic League, and the small farmers of northern Jutland and Funen.  Christian III found his support among the nobles of Jutland. In 1534, peasants under Skipper Clement  (c. 1484–1536) began an uprising in northern Jutland, pillaging the holdings of Lutheran nobles.  An army of nobles and their vassals assembled at Svendstrup and suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of the peasants.  Realizing his hold on the throne was in imminent danger, Christian III negotiated a deal with the Hansa States which allowed him to send his trusted advisor Johan Rantzau north with an army of Protestant German mercenaries. Clement and his army fled north, taking refuge inside the walls of Aalborg. In December, Rantzau's forces breached the walls and stormed the city. Clement managed to escape, but was apprehended a few days later.  He was tried and beheaded in 1535.

With Jutland more or less secure, Christian next focused on gaining control of Scania. He appealed to the Protestant Swedish king Gustav Vasa for help in subduing the rebels. Gustav immediately obliged by sending two armies to ravage central Scania and Halland. The  peasants suffered a bloody defeat at Loshult in Scania. The Swedes moved against Helsingborg Castle, which surrendered in January 1535 and was burned to the ground.

Rantzau moved his army to Funen and defeated Count Christopher's army at  Øksnebjerg on Funen in June 1535. Count Christopher's forces held out in Malmø and Copenhagen until July 1536 when they surrendered after several months of siege by Christian III's forces. With their capitulation, Christian III was firmly placed upon Denmark's throne, and the Roman Catholic forces in Denmark were subdued.

After the war 

A mutual confidence between a king who had conquered his kingdom and a people who had stood in arms against him was not attainable immediately. The circumstances under which Christian III ascended the throne exposed Denmark to the danger of foreign domination. It was with the help of the gentry of the Germanic duchies that Christian had captured Denmark. Holstein and German noblemen had led his armies and directed his diplomacy. The first six years of Christian III's reign were marked by a contest between the Danish Rigsraadet and the German counsellors, both of whom sought to rule through the king. Though the Danish party won a victory at the outset, by obtaining the insertion in the charter of provisions stipulating that only native-born Danes should fill the highest dignities of the state, the king's German counsellors continued paramount during his early reign.

The triumph of Christian III would eventually bring about an end to Roman Catholic Christianity in Denmark, but Roman Catholics still controlled the Council of State. Christian III ordered the arrest of three of the bishops on the State Council by his German mercenaries (12 August 1536).
Christian's debt for the Count's Feud was enormous and confiscating the Church lands (farmed by peasants who had been free from vassalage duties to the nobles) enabled him to pay down the debt to his creditors.

Christian's Protestant policies led Denmark toward the establishment of Lutheranism as the Danish National Church (Folkekirke). This occurred officially on 30 October 1536 when the reconstituted State Council adopted the Lutheran Ordinances designed by  German theologian Johannes Bugenhagen (1485–1558), which outlined church organization, liturgy, and accepted religious practice. Monasteries, nunneries, and priories, were closed and the property taken by the crown (see Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Grayfriars). Vast tracts of land were handed out to the king's supporters, the royal land was rapidly expanded from one-sixth of the national land before the religious reform to 60% after the religious reform.

Later reign 

The dangers threatening Christian III from  Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and other kinsmen of the imprisoned Christian II convinced him of the necessity to lessen the discontent in the land by relying on Danish magnates and nobles. At the High Court (Herredag) of Copenhagen in 1542, the nobility of Denmark voted Christian a twentieth part of all their property to pay off his heavy debt to  German mercenaries. The pivot of the foreign policy of Christian III was his alliance with the German Protestant princes. This provided a counterpoise to the persistent hostility of Charles V, who was determined to support the hereditary claims of his nieces, the daughters of Christian II, to the Scandinavian kingdoms. War was declared against Charles V in 1542, and, though the German Protestant princes proved faithless allies, the closing of the Sound against Dutch shipping proved such an effective weapon in King Christian's hand that the Netherlands compelled Charles V to make peace with Denmark at the diet of Speyer, on 23 May 1544.

Partition of Holstein and Schleswig 
Until this peace, Christian III also ruled the entire Duchies of Holstein and of Schleswig in the name of his then still minor half-brothers John the Elder (Hans den Ældre) and Adolf. They determined their youngest brother Frederick for a career as Diocesan  administrator of an ecclesiastical state within the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1544 the elder three brothers partitioned Holstein (a fief of the Holy Roman Empire) and Schleswig (a Danish fief). Following negotiations between the brothers and the Estates of the Realm of the duchies, the revenues of the duchies were divided into three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and landed estates to each of the three brothers, while other general revenues, such as taxes from towns and customs dues, were levied together but then shared among the brothers. The estates, whose revenues were assigned to the parties, made Holstein and Schleswig look like patchworks, technically inhibiting the emergence of separate new duchies.

Final years 

The foreign policy of King Christian's later days was regulated by peace following the Treaty of Speyer (1544). He carefully avoided all foreign complications; refused to participate in the Schmalkaldic War of 1546; mediated between the Emperor and Saxony after the fall of Maurice of Saxony at the Battle of Sievershausen in 1553. In 1549, he began the building of Landskrona Citadel. He also rebuilt Sønderborg Castle, converting it from a fortress into a four-winged castle in the new Renaissance syle, between 1549 and 1557. In February 1555, he interceded successfully on the behalf of the English Bible translator and Bishop of Exeter, Miles Coverdale (1488–1569), who had been imprisoned for two and a half years by Queen Mary I of England.  Coverdale was then released and allowed to leave England.

King Christian III died in 1559 on New Year's Day at Koldinghus, and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral in a funerary monument designed by Flemish sculptor Cornelis Floris de Vriendt (1514–1575).

Memorials 
In 1579, King Frederick II commissioned Dutch artists to erect a memorial at Roskilde Cathedral.

King Christian III of Denmark received an honorary stone at the Walk of Fame at Landskrona which Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf inaugurated  in  2013.

Children 
Christian married Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg on 29 October 1525 at Lauenburg Castle. She was daughter of Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.
Christian and Dorothea were the parents of five children:
Anna of Denmark (1532–1585), married to Augustus, Elector of Saxony.
Frederick II of Denmark (1534–1588), succeeded as King of Denmark and Norway.
Magnus of Denmark (1540–1583), became Duke of Holstein, and later titular King of Livonia.
Hans of Denmark (John the Younger; 1545–1622), Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg as 'John II'.
Dorothea of Denmark (1546–1617), married to William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and  mother of George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

430,30948860,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony%20Farindon,Anthony Farindon,"Anthony Farindon (1598 – 9 October 1658), was an English royalist divine.

Early life
Farindon was born at Sonning, Berkshire, and was baptised on 24 December 1598. His name is also spelled Farndon, Faringdon, Farringdon, Farington, and Farrington. He was admitted a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, on 9 June 1612. He graduated B.A. on 26 June 1616, was admitted a fellow in 1617, and graduated M.A. on 28 March 1620. Later in the same year he joined with fifty-two other masters of arts, including Gilbert Sheldon and Peter Heylyn, in a petition to John Prideaux, the vice-chancellor. On 17 December 1629 he graduated B.D. Henry Ireton, who was admitted as a gentleman-commoner of Trinity College in 1626, was put under discipline by Farindon for some act of insubordination, and the tutor is said to have remarked that Ireton 'would prove either the best or the worst instrument that ever this kingdome bred' (Lloyd).

Clerical career
In 1634 Farindon was presented by John Bancroft, bishop of Oxford, to the vicarage of Bray, Berkshire; and in 1639, through the interest of William Laud, he obtained in addition the post of divinity lecturer in the Chapel Royal at Windsor. Here he acquired the friendship of John Hales of Eton College. He lost his preferments during the First English Civil War. It is said that Ireton, immediately after the second battle of Newbury (27 October 1644), quartered himself on Farindon, and plundered his vicarage out of revenge for the college grievance. Farindon appears to have been superseded by one Brice, afterwards of Henley, Oxfordshire, and Brice, in 1649, by Hezekiah Woodward, an Independent supporter of Oliver Cromwell. What became of Farindon between 1644 and 1647 does not appear. He seems to have left his wife and children in the parish of Bray; the legal fifths, which were to go to their maintenance, were withheld by Woodward; Hales, though himself obliged to sell part of his library, assisted them.

In 1647, through the influence of Sir John Robinson, a kinsman of Laud, Farindon was chosen as minister of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street. John Bramston wrote that in a short time it was very difficult to get a place. The Milk Street church was known as 'the scholars' church,’ and Farindon had Henry Hammond and Robert Sanderson among his auditors. He complied with the existing restrictions by not using the Book of Common Prayer, but this did not save him from the effect of the harsh measures which pursued the sequestered clergy. He is said to have been turned out of his London charge in 1651 or 1652, but this is inconsistent with the date (12 December 1654) of his funeral sermon for Sir George Whitmore. It may be gathered from Walker's statements that he held his position till the taking effect (1 January 1656) of Cromwell's declaration (24 November 1655), which forbade sequestered clergy to preach in public. On the two Sundays preceding his departure a clerical friend preached for him, when the parishioners made collections at the church doors, and presented him with £400.

He returned to the country, and was in the daily habit of paying a visit to Hales, then reduced to a 'mean lodging' at Eton, where in May he died. On learning his friend's circumstances, Farindon said: 'I have at present money to command, and to-morrow will pay you fifty pounds in part of the many sums I and my poor wife have received of you in our great necessities, and will pay you more, suddenly, as you shall want it.' Hales, though nearly at his last shilling of ready money, refused to take a penny from Farindon. It was to Farindon that Hales gave directions for his simple funeral.

Death
Farindon died in the country on 9 October 1658; it is not certain whether he had been allowed to resume his London ministry; he was buried at the church in Milk Street. His will, which is dated 6 October, mentions his sons Anthony and Charles, and four daughters.

Works
Farindon's reputation rests on 130 sermons, of which 31 were published by himself, in a volume dedicated to Robinson, his patron, the remainder by his executors, John Millington and John Powney (son of an old servant of Hales). At the university he had been 'a noted preacher' (Walker).

His works are:

 'XXX. Sermons,’ &c., 1657 (some copies are dated MDCXLVII., the British Museum copy has MDCLVII.; the dedication is dated 20 April 1657; in reality there are thirty-one sermons).
 'Forty Sermons,’ &c. 1663, fol. (edited by Anthony Scattergood for the executors). These two volumes were reprinted in 1672; the reprint differs both in number of sermons (having eight additional) and in their arrangement.
 'Fifty Sermons,’ &c. 1674 (Thomas Jackson thought the sermon on Ps. li. 12 not genuine).

There is a complete edition of the sermons, 1849, 4 vols.

Farindon at the time of his death was collecting materials for a life of Hales. These papers were sent by Millington, his executor, to Izaak Walton, who placed them at the disposal of William Fulman. The paper containing Farindon's account of his last visits to Hales came on Fulman's death into the hands of Archdeacon Davies of Sapperton, Gloucestershire, who communicated it to George Walker. Chalmers, in his life of Hales, made some use of Farindon's materials, as digested by Fulman.

432,52269504,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry%20Laine,Cherry Laine,"Florence Evadne (born January 4, 1943), who is known professionally as Cherry Laine, is a Jamaican-born singer based in Spain (and formerly Germany), contracted to Bernt Moehrle, who worked with CBS Records. She is known for disco hits ""A Night in Chicago"" (1977), ""The Sea-Fare Folk"" (1979), and ""Catch the Cat"" (1978) — which was number one in Spain and reached Gold. She issued one album, I'm Hot (CBS 83608), which was recorded at Europasound Studios with producer and composer Bernt Möhrle, known for creating a new standard of disco with his Chilly project, and producer of Le Angeli, Mabel and many more.

Biography
Evadne was born in Juno Pen, St. Mary, Jamaica to a clergyman father, and mother who was a nurse. She began singing at age six at her local church. Her family later emigrated to the United Kingdom. Once her parents passed away, she moved to Frankfurt, West Germany, changed her stage name, and pursued her dreams of becoming a professional singer.  In 1977, she performed at the Frankfurt discotheque, Dorian Gray, where Bernt Möhrle discovered her. Möhrle offered her an opportunity to create the solo project, Cherry Laine, with Bernt Moehrle as producer and composer. After two singles ""Everybody Knows It"" and ""A Night in Chicago"", Chery Laine had her first international hit with ""Catch The Cat"", which became No. 1 in Austria and Spain — where it became a double gold record. Among her other songs that were hits during the disco era around the world include ""Speed Freak Sam"" (1979) and ""Danny's Disco"" (1979). Cherry Laine would go on to work with Bernt Moehrle for many years in the studio and also as a chorus and background singer.

In 1981, she represented Germany and won the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile with the song ""Waiting"". Her other singles, including ""Catch The Cat"" further had intense airplay and record sales in South America. The song even peaked at number 100 in Australia in December 1978.

In the mid-1980s, Laine moved to Spain where she still lives today with her husband and composer, Karl Heinz Merkel. Here she continued her music career and released 3 further albums.

Since 2019, Laine has a contract with Sunshine Records and released the album ""Black and White"" in March of that year.

433,2862343,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El%20Presidente%20%28band%29,El Presidente (band),"El Presidente (also written El Pres!dente) was a pop rock band from Glasgow, Scotland. Formed in 2002 by Gun member Dante Gizzi, the band gained major exposure with slots at T in the Park 2005, V Festival 2005 and again at T in the Park in 2006. The band have also supported Oasis, Duran Duran, Simple Minds and Kasabian on major tours of the UK.

History
Whilst touring in France with Gun, Gizzi came up with the name El Presidente and after Gun split, began working on his own songs.  In 2002 he made a few demos, along with brother Jools, on a small sampler and Billy Sloan aired them on his Sunday night Radio Clyde show.

After a couple of gigs at King Tuts in Glasgow as a solo artist with studio recorded backing tracks, Gizzi got a band together.  The original line-up included brother Jools (previously also with Gun) on guitar and current drummer Dawn Zhu on drums. On signing up with One Records a subsidiary of GR management in Glasgow (also the Gun management team) a couple of the original members decided they did not want to tour with the band.  Gizzi then recruited Laura Marks, Thomas McNeice and Johnny McGlynn.  Shortly after the band signed a deal with Sony BMG.
 
The band's first release was a limited edition (1000 copies), red 10"" vinyl released on 31 January 2005 which was promoted by the band's first video, which was produced by Jonas Odell and cost over £25,000. On 17  January they embarked on their first UK tour, supported by Stagger Lee. In February they shot their next video for the single ""100 MPH"". The accompanying video featured the band playing the song in different size boxes, reminiscent of a giant Rubik's Cube.

In April they supported Kasabian on another UK tour, then Oasis in May, on their only Scottish date. ""100 MPH"" was released on 2 May on a two-track CD, a DVD single and limited yellow vinyl. It reached #37 in the UK Singles Chart. To promote it, the band made their début on the BBC Television music programme Top of the Pops; plus on GMTV and CD:UK. In June, the band played two back to back sell out nights at King Tuts, and on 24 June 2005, were meant to play at the Glastonbury Festival, but their stage flooded and the band's set was cancelled.

On 25 July 2005, the band released ""Without You"". To promote it, they performed on GMTV, Top Of The Pops and TRL (on MTV). They did a session on BBC Radio 2 (in which they performed ""Without You"" and a cover of Prince's ""Raspberry Beret""). There was a number of articles in The Sun and other national newspapers and the song was playlisted on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and Xfm. The single reached number 30 in the UK chart. In July and August 2005 the band played some festivals, and a sell-out gig at The Liquid Rooms in Edinburgh. In September their next single was announced, which was to be a re-release of ""Rocket"". The video was an edited down version of the older video, but the single was re-recorded with the current line-up. They appeared on TRL again, but only for an interview, and they did numerous radio sessions on XFM and BBC Radio 2, The video was also playlisted on MTV Hits and Brand Spanking New. The single reached number 48.

On 24 October 2005, the band's début album was released with nine drum tracks recorded by original GUN drummer Alan Thornton and backing vocals on Turn This Thing Around. It reached number 57 in the UK Albums Chart. The band embarked on a full UK tour in September and October, and in early September supported Jamiroquai. In November they also took part in the charity recording of ""Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)"" (originally by the Buzzcocks) as a tribute to the late John Peel. On 17 December the band played a Christmas show at the Barrowlands. Then on New Year's Eve 2005, they played at the annual Hogmanay celebration in the Royal Gardens in Scotland.

On 6 February 2006 the band released their fourth and final single from their début album, which was a re-recorded version of ""Turn This Thing Around"". The video to the song was shot in November in Japan. The story line to video was the lead singer, Gizzi had lost his memory, and must find the band on time to get to the show. The single did better than ""Rocket"", and went to number 39.

In July 2006 they performed at T In The Park on the main stage. They premièred one new song ""Late Night Binges"". On 21 July  2006, the band attended the Northsound 1 Awards, nominated for Best Live Act.

On their French November 2006 tour, another new song, ""Reach Out"" was played. Recording on their second album started in October. Johnny McElhone (Texas' bassist) also worked with the band on their second album, although just what his contribution will be is yet to be announced.

They played RockNess on 9 June 2007 and Saturday of the 2007 Glastonbury Festival.

Prior to the band's tour of France in November 2006, it was reported on the band's MySpace page by Marks that 'some recording was finished' in Glasgow. A further internet blog from the band came in January 2007 stating that recording was ongoing, and a new single and album would follow in the summer of 2007. No new information followed, and, due to Marks' current TV presenting role and Gizzi's work with Gun in 2008, it is uncertain where the band's future lies. The band's website, has since been re-directed to an unregistered domain and it is unknown whether the website itself still exists.

434,3816598,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmah%20Oil,Burmah Oil,"The Burmah Oil Company was a leading British oil company which was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 1966, Castrol was acquired by Burmah, which was renamed ""Burmah-Castrol"". BP Amoco (now BP) purchased the company in 2000.

History 
The company was founded in Glasgow in 1886 by David Sime Cargill, an East India merchant, to succeed his Rangoon Oil Company Ltd, also of Glasgow, to further expand and develop oil fields in the Indian subcontinent.  On his death in 1904 the ownership and chairmanship passed to his son Sir John Cargill.

In the 1900s, the Admiralty was projecting a changeover from coal to fuel oil for its warships. In 1905, the company signed a contract with the Admiralty to supply naval fuel oil from Rangoon.

In the first decade of the 20th century, Burmah Oil created a new subsidiary company named Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) to succeed the early prospecting in Persia of William Knox D'Arcy. 97% of the new company's shares were held by Burmah Oil, nearly all by the Cargill family. Burmah Oil became the largest oil company in the British Empire. The subsidiary was later renamed Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, then British Petroleum and eventually BP.

For about a century, the company, through its subsidiaries, played a major role in the oil industry, and in the discovery of oil in the Middle East through its significant influence over British Petroleum. It marketed itself under the BOC brand in Burma, Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) and Assam (in India), and through a joint venture Burmah-Shell with Shell in the rest of India.

Until 1901, when the Standard Oil Company started operations in Burma, Burmah Oil enjoyed a monopoly in the region. The company operated in Burma until 1963, when Ne Win nationalized all industries in the country. Based on nationalized assets of Burmah Oil, the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise was created.

The company was involved in a landmark legal case in 1964, Burmah Oil Co. v Lord Advocate, concerning compensation for the destruction of oil fields in Burma by British forces in 1942 to avoid them falling into the hands of the invading Japanese army, winning a 3-2 decision in the House of Lords, but the effect of this was specifically reversed by the War Damage Act 1965.

In 1963, the company left Burma and undertook new exploration in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australasia, the Americas, Canada and the North Sea until 1986.  In 1966, Burmah acquired Castrol  renaming it Burmah-Castrol. 

The Bank of England came to the rescue of Burmah Oil after the company made large losses on its tanker fleets in 1974. The core of the rescue operation was the provision of a year's grace so that the company could become smaller and more viable. The Bank of England also agreed to guarantee $650 million of the company's foreign currency borrowings.

In 2000, Burmah was acquired by the then BP Amoco (now renamed BP).

Career

Amateur career
As an amateur he represented England in the flyweight division at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica.

He won the 1966 Amateur Boxing Association British bantamweight title, when boxing out of the Robert Browning ABC.

Professional career
From Walworth in London, Clark made his professional debut in October 1966, fighting a draw against Tommy Connor.

Trained by Charlie Page at the Thomas a Becket gym, he won his next 27 fights, and in April 1970 faced Alan Rudkin for the British bantamweight title and the vacant Commonwealth bantamweight title at the Royal Albert Hall. Rudkin stopped him in the twelfth round to take both titles. In April 1971 he faced John Kellie in a final eliminator for the British title; He was stopped in the second round, but six months later they met again, with Clark stopping Kellie in the eighth. This led to a challenge for Rudkin's British and Commonwealth titles in January 1972; The fight went the full 15 rounds, with Rudkin retaining the titles by half a point.

Clark got a third shot at the British title in 1973 after Rudkin had vacated it. He faced Paddy Maguire at the Royal Albert Hall, winning on points to become British champion.

In April 1973 he added the European title, beating Franco Zurlo by unanimous decision. He successfully defended the title in January 1974, beating Salvatore Fabrizio by majority decision.

He beat Chuck Spencer in March 1974, and Luigi Tessarin in May, but in the absence of adequate purse offers, relinquished his British title, and in August 1974 was forced to retire due to a detached retina in his right eye, while still the reigning European champion.

Clark died in December 2020 at the age of 73.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.

Name
The Slovene name Travni Dol literally means 'grassy valley'. The German name Drandul (or Drandol) and the Gottscheerish name Trandul are approximations of the Slovene name.  The name of the settlement was also recorded as Traundul in the land registry of 1574 and in 1881. The name Travni Dol and names like it (e.g., Trava) are derived from the Slovene common noun trava 'grass'.

History
Travni Dol was listed in the land registry of 1574 but no information on the number of houses or inhabitants was provided. It was not listed at all in the 1770 census and may have been overlooked. In 1937 the village had 12 houses and a population of 37. The villagers farmed for their own needs and also exported wood to Zagreb via Uršna Sela. During the Second World War, Italian forces burned six houses in the village. They were not rebuilt after the war. A reunion of Gottschee Germans was held in Travni Dol on 19 and 20 June 1999, attended by Slovene and Austrian government representatives.

Independence

The land now known as Brazil was claimed by the Portuguese for the first time on 23 April 1500 when the Navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. Permanent settlement by the Portuguese followed in 1534, and for the next 300 years they slowly expanded into the territory to the west until they had established nearly all of the frontiers which constitute modern Brazil's borders. In 1808 the army of French Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, forcing the Portuguese royal family into exile. They established themselves in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, which thus became the unofficial seat of the entire Portuguese Empire. On 12 December 1815 Dom João VI, then regent on behalf of his incapacitated mother, Queen Dona Maria I, elevated Brazil from colony to Kingdom united with Portugal.

In 1820 the Constitutionalist Revolution erupted in Portugal. The movement, initiated by liberals, resulted in a meeting of the Cortes (English: Courts, a Constituent Assembly) which had as its goal to draft the kingdom's first constitution. The liberals demanded the return of João VI, who had been residing in Brazil since 1808 and who had succeeded his mother as King in 1816. He named his son and heir Prince Dom Pedro (later Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro IV of Portugal) as regent and departed for Europe on 26 April 1821. The Portuguese Cortes enacted decrees which subordinated the Brazilian provincial governments directly to Portugal, abolished all superior courts and administrative bodies created within Brazil since 1808 and recalled Prince Pedro to Portugal.

Two groups emerged, both of which feared that the Cortes was attempting to return Brazil to the status of a mere colony: the Luso-Brazilians (then called Constitutional Monarchists) and the Nativists (then called Federalists). Members of both were mainly Brazilian-born gentry, landowners, farmers and rich business men, with a minority who were immigrants from Portugal. The Luso-Brazilians were men who graduated in the University of Coimbra in Portugal before 1816 and were led by José Bonifácio de Andrada. They called for a constitutional and centralized monarchy to prevent the possibility of provincial secessionism. A few, such as Bonifácio, had further goals which included abolishing the slave trade and slavery itself, instituting land reform, and economic development of the country free of foreign loans. The Nativists, men without a higher education who had lived their entire lives in Brazil, desired exactly the opposite. They opposed the end of slavery, wanted a democracy in which only they were enfranchised, preservation of the existing social hierarchy, a monarch who would be a mere figurehead, and a weak federal organization in which the provinces would be ruled by the local interests without interference from the central government.

Both groups convinced the Prince not to return to Portugal, and he replied on 9 January 1822: ""Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell the people that I am staying."""" He appointed José Bonifácio, leader of the Luso-Brazilians, as head of the Cabinet on 18 January 1822. Pedro traveled to São Paulo province to secure its loyalty to the Brazilian cause, but he received a letter from Bonifácio as he was returning to Rio de Janeiro on 7 September. The prince learned that the Cortes had annulled the remaining powers he had retained. Pedro turned to his companions, who included his Guard of Honor and said: ""Friends, the Portuguese Cortes wants to enslave and pursue us. From today onward our relations are broken. No ties unites us any longer"". Pulling off his blue and white armband which symbolized Portugal, he continued: ""Armbands off, soldiers. Hail to independence, to freedom and to the separation of Brazil"". In a moment which would become the most iconic in Brazilian history, he unsheathed his sword and affirmed that ""For my blood, my honor, my God, I swear to give Brazil freedom"", and then cried out: ""Independence or death!""

Pedro's decision to defy the Cortes was met with armed opposition across Brazil by troops loyal to Portugal. The ensuing Brazilian War of Independence spread throughout most of the country, with battles fought in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824, and independence was recognized by Portugal on 29 August 1825. In addition to those Brazilians and Portuguese who fought in the war, much of the credit for this victory is credited to Bonifácio's cabinet. It created an army and a navy practically out of nothing, greatly improved government finances, and unified the provinces under a single, cohesive leadership.

On 12 October 1822 Prince Pedro was acclaimed Dom Pedro I, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil. It was concurrently the beginning of Pedro's reign and the birth of the independent Empire of Brazil. He was later crowned on 1 December. Meanwhile, Bonifácio initiated a judicial inquiry (which would become known as the ""Bonifácia"") against the Nativists, who were accused of conspiracy against the monarchy. Many were arrested.

Before declaring independence, Pedro had called for holding Brazilian elections to select delegates to a Constituent and Legislative National Assembly. On 3 May 1823, the Constituent Assembly initiated work towards framing a political Constitution for the new nation. Its members, called national deputies, numbered 100 although only 88 actually sat on its sessions. They were indirectly elected by censitary suffrage and none belonged to political parties (these having yet to be formed). There were factions within it: the Luso-Brazilians, the Nativists, the Absolutists (then called Hunchbacks) and the Republicans. The latter were a few individuals with little influence or support. The remaining deputies were all monarchists. The Absolutists were mostly Portuguese who initially opposed Brazilian independence, although they accepted self-determination once it became inevitable. They opposed constitutional government and supported an absolutist form of monarchy. The Luso-Brazilians and Nativists supported a constitutional monarchy, with the former preferring a centralized government and the latter a loose federation.

The proposed Constitution was sent to the Assembly, where its members began working towards its promulgation. From the outset, the Nativists made attempts to overthrow the cabinet headed by Bonifácio at any cost. They wanted to avenge the persecution they had experienced during the ""Bonifácia"" in the previous year. The Absolutists, on the other hand, saw their interests threatened when Bonifácio issued two decrees which eliminated privileges reserved for those of Portuguese birth. Although holding many ideological differences, the Absolutists and the Nativists formed an alliance in order to remove their common enemy from power. Bonifácio himself had begun to lose support inside his own faction due to his arbitrary actions. A far more important factor which fueled the ever-increasing number of dissidents was reaction to the radical, if prescient, ideas he held—including the abolition of slavery. Eventually, disaffected members constituted a majority of the seats in the Assembly and signed a petition requesting the dismissal of Bonifácio's Cabinet. With the only alternative being to enter into an unnecessary conflict with the Assembly, Pedro I complied.

The emperor appointed a member of the Nativists to head a new cabinet. Consequently, the Luso-Brazilians who had supported Bonifácio were recast as the opposition and created newspapers to attack adversaries in the Cabinet and the Assembly. Minor incidents continued to aggravate the internal struggle for power. The members of the Assembly paid little attention to completing work on the Constitution and instead concentrated on taking down their enemies. After several months, they had only approved 24 articles out of a total of 272.

The Emperor signed a decree dissolving the Assembly (something that even Bonifácio believed was the monarch's prerogative). Six deputies, including Bonifácio, were banished to France. However, they received a pension from the Brazilian government as long as they lived there. The Nativists who were persecuted during the ""Bonifácia"" were pardoned. But the dissolution of the Assembly did not signify an end to the careers of other deputies: 33 would later become Senators, 28 would be appointed Ministers of State, 18 would serve as provincial presidents, 7 would sit as members of the first State Council, and 4 would act as regents.

On 13 November 1823, Pedro I placed the newly established Council of State in charge of writing a proposal for a new Constitution—which was finished in just fifteen days. The Council of State was formed by men from both the Luso-Brazilians and the Nativists. The Council used the partly completed project which had been crafted in the Constituent Assembly as a model for the new charter. After finishing it, a copy was sent to all Municipal Chambers for a decision as to whether or not to accept the new charter and present it to a new Constituent Assembly for endorsement. But some of the Municipal Chambers suggested that, instead, it should immediately be approved as the Brazil's Constitution. Once the idea had been aired, the vast majority of the Municipal Chambers, composed of councilmen elected by the Brazilian people as their local representatives, voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire. The first Brazilian Constitution was then promulgated and solemnly sworn in the Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro on 25 March 1824.

The liberal opposition

Although liberal in its content, the Constitution created a centralized government, where the provinces had no true autonomy. Desire for local control sparked a minor rebellion in some provinces in the northeast in 1824 which was easily suppressed, but the incident was enough to reveal discontent with the State's organization. At the end of 1825, a secessionist rebellion began in Cisplatina, the southernmost Brazilian province. Unlike the rest of the nation, its population consisted of both Luso-American and Hispano-American elements, a result of colonial times when sovereignty over the region shifted between Portugal and Spain. The United Provinces of South America (a former Spanish colony later known as Argentina) formally annexed the Brazilian province. The Empire responded with a declaration of war, which ""was to draw Brazil into a long, inglorious, and ultimately futile war in the south"" – the Cisplatine War. João VI died in March 1826, a few months after the outbreak, and Pedro I inherited the Portuguese crown, becoming King Pedro IV. Brazil and Portugal were again reunited—though only in a personal union—barely 2 years following the end of the war for Brazilian independence. Pedro I quickly abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his eldest daughter Maria II, but as she was a minor, he retained involvement in Portuguese affairs.

When the General Assembly was reopened in May 1826, more than 2 years after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by Pedro I, ""suspicions about the sincerity of his attachment to constitutional government and to Brazil's independence were already widespread."" Pedro I and a considerable part of the legislature shared a similar ideal, that is, ""of a constitutional order endowed with an elected legislature and independent judiciary but directed by a supreme ruler whose superior talents and favourable star gave him uncontested authority."" Another part of the parliament ""accepted the people-or more, precisely, that section of the population who qualified as 'civilized' [that is, the ruling circles only]-to be the source of authority, with they representatives they elected controlling power."" The latter would form a loose alliance – known as the first Liberal Party – which also advocated a greater and true provincial autonomy. Thus, a ""clash between two conflicting ideologies underlay all the battles that raged from 1826 to 1831 over the organization of the governance, the functioning of the political process, and the goals to be pursued in international affairs."" The situation only worsened in 1828 when the war in the south ended with the loss of Cisplatina, which became the independent republic of Uruguay and the usurpation of Maria II's throne by Prince Miguel, Pedro I's younger brother. Uncapable of dealing with Brazil and Portugal affairs at the same time, the emperor abdicated in behalf of his son (who became Pedro II) on 7 April 1831 and immediately departed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.

Regency

A troubled regency

Since Pedro II would only be 18 in 1843, an elected regency was created to replace the emperor during his minority. Joaquim Nabuco, writing in the 1890s, remarked that the Brazilian republicans saw this period as their chance to prove that the country could survive in peace without a monarch as superior arbiter, as a neutral character above rival parties. However, this republican experience proved itself to be a complete disaster: as a republic, Brazil was no better than its Hispanic-American neighbors. The regency had little effective authority which resulted in nine years of chaos during which the country was plagued by rebellions and coup attempts initiated by unruly political factions.

The Liberal Party which assumed power on 7 April had been only a loose coalition representing ""disparate interests, united only by their opposition to Pedro I."" Although they were called liberals various groups within the coalition championed one or another liberal ideal while others opposed these points preferring to promote other aspects of liberalism. The party soon split into two factions: the republicans (also known as the ""Extremists"" or ""Tatters"") which was a small but aggressive group and the ""moderate"" liberals. The moderate liberals consisted of a coalition of the Nativists whose main leader was the priest Diogo Antônio Feijó and the Coimbra bloc–so-called because many of its supporters had graduated from Coimbra University. The Coimbra bloc's main leaders were Pedro de Araújo Lima (later Marquis of Olinda) and Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos. Vasconcelos acted not only as a leader but also as a mentor to the younger generation of his faction which included Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), Paulino Soares de Sousa (later the first Viscount of Uruguay) and Joaquim José Rodrigues Torres.

There were also other, smaller groups not related to the moderates of which the most important were the restorationists (or Caramurus) who called for the return of Pedro I as regent for his son. Beyond the need to fight the restorationist threat the only other common interest uniting the Nativists and the Coimbra bloc into the Moderate Party was their support of federalism. The Brazilian constitution was overly centralized and this was one of the main reasons behind their opposition to the former emperor who was openly against any constitutional amendment. The Moderate Party believed that by granting more autonomy to the provinces it could placate discontent and extinguish any separatist threat.

A constitutional amendment effecting greater decentralization was voted upon and approved in the Chambers of Deputies, but it still faced major opposition in the Senate. The priest Antônio Feijó planned a coup d’état in which he would assume dictatorial powers and the constitutional amendment would be enacted concurrently without the approval of the National Assembly (Parliament). On 30 July 1832 some Nativist deputies (in concert with Feijó) put a proposal before the Chamber that parliament be turned into a constituent assembly and that a new constitution be adopted using as part of their argument that the senate was filled with restorationist senators. The Deputy Carneiro Leão managed to successfully rally the other deputies against the Nativists' proposal and the coup attempt was crushed. The Coimbra bloc's firm actions prevented restriction of legal rights and kept Brazil from sliding into dictatorship during the regency even under the threat of rebellions and political crises.

The Additional Act and resulting rebellions

The constitutional amendment, called the Ato Adicional (Additional Act), was finally promulgated on 12 August 1834. Among its provisions was the establishment of a quasi-federal national structure due to administrative and political provincial decentralization. ""Dissolution of power to the provinces, far from placating local ambitions and discontents, kindled them into flame. In the far north and the far south, civil wars broke out."" The higher administrative and political provincial decentralization exacerbated conflicts between political parties, as whichever dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force. Rebellious factions, however, continued to uphold the Throne as a way of giving the appearance of legitimacy to their actions (that is, they were not in revolt against the monarchy per se). The Cabanagem (1835–40), the Sabinada (1837–38) and the Balaiada (1838–41) all followed this course, even though in some instances provinces attempted to secede and become independent republics (though ostensibly only so long as Pedro II was a minor). The exception was the Ragamuffin War, which began as yet another dispute between political factions in the province of Rio Grande do Sul but quickly evolved into a separatist rebellion financed by the Argentine dictator Don Manuel Rosas. But even in this case, the majority of the province's population, including the largest and most prosperous cities, remained loyal to the Empire.

In April 1835 an election was held to select a new regent. The outcome was problematic as no candidate won a majority of the vote. Feijó, the leader of the Nativists, garnered the most votes and assumed office on 12 October. News of the premature death of former emperor Pedro I on 24 September 1834 had arrived from Europe effectively removing the restorationist movement as a factor in national politics. Many restorationists joined the ranks of the Coimbra bloc. Both groups shared similar economic, social and ideological views. They were all firm monarchists and opposed Feijó. The death of Pedro I eliminated the chief difference between them as the Coimbra bloc was firmly opposed to his return. The first hints of what would later become the Conservative Party appeared when they began throwing their support to candidates other than Feijó and it became clearer after Deputy Carneiro Leão initiated talks with the restorationists in October 1834.

Once in office Feijó proved to be an authoritarian with little inclination to be accountable to parliament. By 1837 his government's credibility and support had disappeared. Uprisings both in the north and south had not been suppressed and other issues were ignored. ""The country's needs were not being addressed."" The reinvigorated Coimbra bloc intensified its efforts to remove Feijó from office due to inappropriate behavior and in August 1837 the regent resigned. He was replaced by Araújo Lima who appointed his colleagues to fill ministry portfolios. The Coimbra bloc ""had come to power—not through a coup, not through a dynast's favor, but through the conquest of a representative majority in the Chamber.""

This marked the extinction of the always weak Moderate Party, whose demise was symbolized with the death of Evaristo de Veiga in May, the last tie that kept united both Nativists and the Coimbra bloc. The Coimbra bloc began a policy aimed at restoring and enforcing order throughout Brazil. A new law was passed which built upon the Ato Adicional of 1834 to allow the national government to reassert control over provincial police and courts. This greatly enhanced the national government's ability to deal with rebels. However, no changes were made to the administrative and political autonomy granted to the provinces by the amendment of 1834. The Coimbra bloc's credibility was considerably enhanced by ""the close links, both political and personal, that its leaders established with the booming coffee sector in the Paraíba valley just to the north of Rio de Janeiro city. Coffee exports quadrupled during the 1820s and doubled again between 1829 and 1835."" ""The economic boom strengthened the position of the national government, increasing its revenues and its ability to secure loans.""

Feijo's Nativists allied with minor parties and remnants of other factions in opposition to the new government. These shared no common principles or ideology. ""They were a pragmatic alliance involving everyone from republican radicals to moderate reformists to liberal monarchists to former restorationists."" This group would evolve during the 1840s into the second ""Liberal Party"". Fearful that their adversaries would perpetuate themselves in power the Liberals began to call for a lowering of the age at which Pedro II would attain majority. They saw an opportunity to regain influence by doing away with the regency and instead dealing directly with a pliable young emperor. ""Without experience, he might be manipulated by whoever brought him to power."" Towards that end they allied themselves with a new and powerful political faction known as ""The Courtier Faction"" led by Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho (later the Viscount of Sepetiba) who was one Feijó's supporters in the 30 July 1832 failed coup. The Courtier Faction had been formed by politicians and high-ranking servants in the Imperial Palace who were close to the young emperor.

Consolidation

The Courtier Faction and Pedro II's early majority

The Coimbra bloc was not opposed to lowering the age of majority for the emperor but they demanded that any change should be made through legal means i.e. a constitutional amendment. After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures – from both the Conservative and Liberal Parties – who had arisen during the 1830s became wary of taking on a greater role in ruling the nation. They looked to the Emperor as providing a fundamental and useful source of authority essential both for governing and for national survival. It was an ironic turn: the same politicians who opposed Pedro I for being a central figure in politics were now trying to put his son in that same position. Unlike the conservatives, however, the liberals were less scrupulous and with popular support and after pressuring the regent to accept the loss of his position declared Pedro II of age on 23 July 1840.

This outcome was predictable since 1838. When Araújo Lima was elected regent in place of Feijó he named Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos to one of the ministry portfolios and he soon became a de facto Prime Minister, with even more power than the regent himself. He ""could not cooperate but had to dominate, and he could not tolerate centers of authority independent of his will. No wonder that even his allies at lengtht became resentful and rebellious"". Vasconcelos also tried, unsuccessfully, to remove the Imperial Palace servants that were part of the Courtier Faction. Araújo Lima, disliked with the loss of power, removed his support to Vasconcelos' cabinet, who at the point had lost cohesion and resigned office on 18 April 1839. After that, the regent ""could do no more than to construct a succession of ramshackle cabinets lacking support in the legislature"". With the decline of the Coimbra bloc also came of Vasconcelos', whose political influence and power over the party was superseded by the next generation, mainly Carneiro Leão, Rodrigues Torres and Paulino de Sousa.

The Liberal cabinet, formed upon the assumption of majority by Pedro II, called national elections in 1840. These were so violent and fraudulent that they became known as ""Eleições do cacete"" (""Bludgeon elections""). The alliance between liberals and courtiers did not last long. The liberal ministers in the cabinet presented their resignations in an attempt to get rid of their courtier allies. The young and inexperienced emperor was compelled to choose between the ministers and the courtiers. The bluff failed and Pedro II, influenced by the courtiers, accepted the cabinet's resignation. On 23 March 1841 a new cabinet was nominated which included some ministers taken from the Coimbra bloc.

The liberals did not accept their loss of power gracefully. In May and June 1842 there followed three uprisings within the provinces of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro itself. The pretext was a claim ""to be acting against the tyrannical measures of the imperial government, which, they alleged, was holding the monarch captive."" The rebels were easily defeated and by late August the rebellions were over. Among the rebel leaders was the former Regent Feijó who was arrested and died shortly afterwards in 1843.

Members of the Coimbra bloc began to call it the ""Party of Order"" in contrast to what they perceived as the ""unruly"" Liberals. Their suppression of the uprisings left them in a powerful position. In the cabinet there was increasing friction caused by Aureliano Coutinho who owed his seat as minister solely to his influence over Pedro II. It was widely known that he had been antagonistic towards the Party of Order from its inception. Aureliano ""found himself increasingly ostracized and excluded by his fellow ministers"". After a new legislature was seated on 1 January 1843, Aureliano's position worsened and the cabinet pressured him to resign. Pedro II did not want to lose Aureliano and instead opted to dismiss the entire cabinet on 20 January.

Rise of the Conservative Party

On 20 January 1843 the emperor appointed Carneiro Leão, who was now a senator, to head a new cabinet. By personally selecting the cabinet members he became Brazil's de facto first prime minister. Prior to this, the emperor had always designated the cabinet ministers. Building upon this precedent, the office of prime minister would be officially instituted four years later with the title ""President of the Council of Ministers"". The Party of Order at this time held majorities in the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies and the Council of State. The new cabinet opposed amnesty for participants in the 1842 uprisings. This refusal was despite many involved having already been imprisoned for almost a year which rendered the possibilities for successful prosecution unlikely. Carneiro Leão acting as minister of Justice also pursued indictments against five senators who had collaborated during the revolts seeking a trial in the upper house. This came to dominate debate in the Senate and sidelined action on the government's legislative agenda during the ten months of the extended session. The cabinet's uncompromising position lost them the support of many who had cooperated with the ministry. A quarrel between Pedro II and Carneiro Leão led to the cabinet's resignation at the end of January 1844.

For the next four years the Party of Order stood in opposition to the Liberals. During this time they also witnessed the rise and fall of Aureliano Coutinho's ""Courtier Faction"" which was allied to the Liberal Party. The Courtier Faction held nearly absolute sway over Brazilian politics for a couple of years. This lasted until the emperor, now fully grown and experienced, purged everyone linked to the group, including Aureliano—whose influence in politics disappeared after an implicit ban from Pedro II precluded his holding any political post. The monarch made clear that he thereafter would make his own impartial decisions free from the influence of others. From February 1844 through May 1848 the country saw four cabinets in succession—all composed of members from the Liberal Party. The inability of these cabinets to produce any concrete results stood as testimony to their internal divisions. Progressive initiatives lay dormant including new technology (e.g., railroads and the electric telegraph) and new institutions (e.g., a primary school system). After the last Liberal cabinet resigned, Pedro II called upon the Party of Order to form a new cabinet. They were by then known simply as the ""Conservative Party"" due to their goal of ""preserving"" order and the constitutional monarchy.  The former regent Pedro de Araújo Lima, the chief figure among the conservatives, assumed the office of president.

The Praieira revolt and the Platine War

Unlike their rivals, the liberals were incapable of taking turns in office. The most radical faction of the liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia (""Party of the Beach""), were openly prepared to revolt and retake power by force. Although nominally liberal, the praieiros were in reality related to the ""Courtier Faction"" and had Aureliano Coutinho as their national leader. In a sense the rebellion would represent the last gasp of the once-powerful ""Courtier Faction"" which had languished all but defunct since 1847. The praieiros had no popular support and they knew that public opinion was against them—the more so as it became apparent they had no coherent rationale to justify rebellion. The rebellion which had begun on 7 November 1848 had a small reach and was crushed on 2 February 1849 when the praieiros were decisively defeated after attacking the capital of Pernambuco, Recife. The main consequences following the end of the Praieira revolt included the almost complete disappearance of the Liberal Party who were rejected by public opinion for its actions, consolidation of support for the parliamentary monarchy among Brazilians and the supremacy of the Conservative Party in politics during the next decade.

Another issue came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves which had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with Britain. The traffic continued unabated and the British government's passage of the Aberdeen Act of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade. A bill was issued on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government the authority to combat the illegal slave traffic. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate the importation of slaves and Britain recognized that the trade had been at last suppressed.

With Brazil internally pacified and the British menace gone, the conservative cabinet could turn its attention to another serious foreign threat, the Argentine dictator Don Juan Manuel de Rosas. Rosas had sought to annex the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul and planned the conquests of Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. These moves threatened the creation of a dominion encompassing the territories of the old Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata (a former Spanish colony in South America). Brazil's cabinet decided to forge alliances with other nations threatened by the dictator's ambitions and sent an army commanded by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (later the Dukes of Caxias) to Uruguay which crossed the border on 4 September 1851. The Brazilian army split into two parts. Half of it, consisting of a division along with Uruguayan forces and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas who fled to the United Kingdom. The victory over the Argentine dictator was followed by a period of stability and prosperity in Brazil during the 1850s. Chile was the only Latin American nation of the era which was comparable to Brazil in political cohesion and economic strength.

Growth

The Conciliation policy

On 6 September 1853 Carneiro Leão was appointed President of the Council of Ministers and charged with organizing a new cabinet. He was at this time the most influential politician in the country and leader of the Conservative Party. Emperor Pedro II wished to advance his ambitious plan: the Conciliation. The goal of the Conciliation was to put an end to the recurrent factional conflicts which had started with the Restorationists at the beginning of the 1830s and had been continued by the Liberals. It had become usual for parties which were ousted from power in elections to attempt to regain it by force of arms as happened in 1842 and 1848. From that point on political disputes were to be settled democratically in the parliament. Both parties would be required to rise above partisanship and instead devote themselves to the common good of the nation.

The new president invited several Liberals to join the Conservative ranks and went so far as to name some as ministers. The cabinet was plagued from the beginning by strong opposition from Conservative Party members who repudiated the newly adopted conservatives believing that these did not truly share the party's ideals and were mainly interested in gaining public offices. Despite the mistrust Carneiro Leão demonstrated great resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks. Improvements throughout the country were made including the first railroad, steamship passenger lines, sewers, and public gas illumination as well as new incentives to promote immigration from Europe.

With the sudden and unexpected death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet would survive him by only a few months. The Emperor, a critic of the Conciliation as it had been implemented, learned to appreciate its merits and was eager to continue with it. Thus the cabinet survived Carneiro Leão, albeit with another president, until 4 May 1857.

The traditional Conservatives who opposed the Conciliation policy were led by Joaquim José Rodrigues Torres, the Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and Paulino Soares de Sousa, the Viscount of Uruguay—the ""Saquarema Triumvirate"". The Conservative Party was also known as ""Saquarema Party"" due to the coastal town of Saquarema in Rio de Janeiro province where Rodrigues Torres owned coffee plantations. These elder-statesmen were of the same generation as the late Carneiro Leão and had assumed the leadership of the Conservative Party after his death. Although conservative in name, they had repeatedly proven more progressive than their Liberal rivals in many areas.

A new party: the Progressist League
During the years following 1857 none of the cabinets survived long. They had quickly collapsed due to the lack of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the Traditionalists and on the other the Conciliators (who by 1860 were called simply ""moderate conservatives""). The true reason for the schism was not the Conciliation policy as the speeches made it appear. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet a new generation of politicians had emerged eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. These saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the conservative elders who would not easily relinquish control.

Remaining members of the Liberal Party, which had languished since the Praieira rebellion in 1849, took advantage of the Conservative Party's apparent dissolution to return to national politics with renewed strength. They delivered a powerful blow to the government when they managed to win several seats in the Chamber of Deputies in 1860. The Emperor asked the Marquis (later Duke) of Caxias, who had commanded the Brazilian forces in the Platine War and who was also a member of the Conservative Party, to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. The new government had to face a major challenge as the Chamber of Deputies was divided in three groups: the traditional or ""pure"" Conservatives, the ""moderate"" Conservatives and the Liberals. Caxias named men who were part of the pure and moderate Conservatives to the remaining portfolios in an effort to weaken the revigorated Liberal opposition and consolidate a workable governing majority.

The cabinet was unable to function due to a lack of true support internally. It was doomed when José Tomás Nabuco de Araújo Filho, the former Justice minister in the Conciliation cabinet, delivered a speech advocating a merger of moderate Conservatives and Liberals into a truly new political party. So well-received was this speech that both groups voted together as a single cohesive faction, leaving the government without a majority. The cabinet requested Pedro II dissolve the Chamber and call for new elections, but he refused. With no remaining alternative, the ministers resigned. On 24 May 1862 the Emperor named a member of the Moderate-Liberal coalition to form a new cabinet. The new political party, in which the majority of members were former Conservatives, was called the ""Progressist League"".

It was the end of 14 years of Conservative dominance in national politics. The period had marked a time of peace and prosperity for Brazil. ""The political system functioned smoothly. Civil liberties were maintained. A start had been made on the introduction into Brazil of railroad, telegraph and steamship lines. The country was no longer troubled by the disputes and conflicts that had racked it during its first thirty years.""

This tranquility disappeared when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro, William Dougal Christie, nearly sparked a war between Britain and Brazil. Christie believed in Gunboat diplomacy and sent an ultimatum containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and early in 1862. The first was the sinking of a commercial barque on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul and the ensuing ransack of the wreck by local inhabitants. The second was the arrest of drunken British officers who were causing a disturbance in the streets of Rio. The Brazilian government refused to yield and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil's Navy prepared for imminent conflict, the purchase of coastal artillery was ordered, several ironclads were authorized and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. Pedro II was the main reason for Brazil's resistance as he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863 upon seeing the British government's position weaken.

Apogee

The diplomatic victory over the British Empire and the military victory over Uruguay in 1865, followed by the successful conclusion of the war with Paraguay in 1870, marked the beginning of the ""golden age"" of the Brazilian Empire. The Brazilian economy grew rapidly; railroad, shipping and other modernization projects were started; immigration flourished. The Empire became known internationally as a modern and progressive nation, second only to the United States in the Americas; it was a politically stable economy with a good investment potential.

In March 1871, Pedro II named the conservative José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco as the head of a cabinet whose main goal was to pass a law to immediately free all children born to female slaves. The controversial bill was introduced in the Chamber of Deputies in May and faced ""a determined opposition, which commanded support from about one third of the deputies and which sought to organize public opinion against the measure."" The bill was finally promulgated in September and became known as the ""Law of Free Birth"". Rio Branco's success, however, seriously damaged the long-term political stability of the Empire. The law ""split the conservatives down the middle, one party faction backed the reforms of the Rio Branco cabinet, while the second—known as the escravocratas (English: slavocrats)—were unrelenting in their opposition"", forming a new generation of ultraconservatives.

The ""Law of Free Birth"", and Pedro II's support for it, resulted in the loss of the ultraconservatives' unconditional loyalty to the monarchy. The Conservative Party had experienced serious divisions before, during the 1850s, when the Emperor's total support for the conciliation policy had given rise to the Progressives. The ultraconservatives led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí who opposed conciliation in the 1850s had nonetheless believed that the Emperor was indispensable to the functioning of the political system: the Emperor was an ultimate and impartial arbiter when political deadlock threatened. By contrast, this new generation of ultraconservatives had not experienced the Regency and early years of Pedro II's reign, when external and internal dangers had threatened the Empire's very existence; they had only known prosperity, peace and a stable administration. To them—and to the ruling classes in general—the presence of a neutral monarch who could settle political disputes was no longer important. Furthermore, since Pedro II had clearly taken a political side on the slavery question, he had compromised his position as a neutral arbiter. The young ultraconservative politicians saw no reason to uphold or defend the Imperial office.

Paraguayan War

As the threat of war with the British Empire became more real, Brazil had to turn its attention to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay turning its political parties against each other. The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay. Brazil's government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864 beginning the brief Uruguayan War, which ended on 20 February 1865.

Meanwhile, in December 1864 the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack upon the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.

Decline

The weaknesses in the monarchy took many years to become apparent. Brazil continued to prosper during the 1880s, with the economy and society both developing rapidly, including the first organized push for women's rights (which would progress slowly over the next decades). By contrast, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age, increasingly alienated from current events and pessimistic in outlook. He remained meticulous in performing his formal duties as Emperor, albeit often without enthusiasm, but he no longer actively intervened to maintain stability in the country. His increasing ""indifference towards the fate of the regime"" and his inaction to protect the imperial system once it came under threat have led historians to attribute the ""prime, perhaps sole, responsibility"" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the emperor himself.

The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also threatened the long-term prospects for the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor's heir was his eldest daughter, Isabel, who had no interest in, nor expectation of, becoming the monarch. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still a very traditional, male-dominated society, and the prevailing view was that only a male monarch would be capable as head of state. Pedro II, the ruling circles and the wider political establishment all considered a female successor to be inappropriate, and Pedro II himself believed that the death of his two sons and the lack of a male heir were a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted.

A weary Emperor who no longer cared for the throne, an heir who had no desire to assume the crown, an increasingly discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination at the beginning of the 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.

The 1867 collapse of the French-sponsored Second Mexican Empire left Brazil the only Latin American monarchical regime for another 22 years.

Fall

The nation enjoyed considerable international prestige during the final years of the Empire and had become an emerging power in the international arena. While Pedro II was receiving medical treatment in Europe, the parliament passed, and Princess Isabel signed on 13 May 1888, the Golden Law, which completely abolished slavery in Brazil. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery proved to be unfounded. Nonetheless, the end of slavery was the final blow to any remaining belief in the crown's neutrality, and this resulted in an explicit shift of support to Republicanism by the ultraconservatives—themselves backed by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country.

To avert a republican backlash, the government exploited the credit readily available to Brazil as a result of its prosperity to fuel further development. The government extended massive loans at favorable interest rates to plantation owners and lavishly granted titles and lesser honors to curry favor with influential political figures who had become disaffected. The government also indirectly began to address the problem of the recalcitrant military by revitalizing the moribund National Guard, by then an entity which existed mostly only on paper.

The measures taken by the government alarmed civilian republicans and the positivists in the military. The republicans saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. The reorganization of the National Guard was begun by the cabinet in August 1889, and the creation of a rival force caused the dissidents among the officer corps to consider desperate measures. For both groups, republicans and military, it had become a case of ""now or never"". Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government, republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy.

They launched a coup and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that, ""[r]arely has a revolution been so minor."" Throughout the coup Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions put forward by politicians and military leaders for quelling the rebellion. The Emperor and his family were sent into exile on 17 November. Although there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the Empire, this was thoroughly suppressed, and neither Pedro II nor his daughter supported a restoration. Despite being unaware of the plans for a coup, once it occurred and in light of the Emperor's passive acceptance of the situation, the political establishment supported the end of the monarchy in favor of a republic. They were unaware that the goal of the coup leaders was the creation of a dictatorial republic rather than a presidential or parliamentary republic.

450,7297586,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Haven%20Emerson,John Haven Emerson,"John Haven ""Jack"" Emerson (February 5, 1906 – February 4, 1997) was an American inventor of biomedical devices, specializing in respiratory equipment. He is perhaps best remembered for his work in improving the iron lung.

Early life
Emerson was born in 1906 in New York City, the son of Dr. Haven Emerson, Health Commissioner of New York City, and Grace Parrish Emerson, the sister of Maxfield Parrish. He was named for his paternal grandfather (1840–1913), who was also a medical doctor.

At the age of 22, he bought a rudimentary machine shop from the estate of a local inventor. He moved the equipment to a small warehouse in Harvard Square, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he built research apparatus for professors and researchers of Boston-area medical schools, and produced many inventions over the following years. In 1928, he designed a Barcroft-Warburg apparatus for tissue respiration studies. In 1930, he designed a new type of micromanipulator which was valuable in early physiology studies and later saw use in assembly of electronic components. In 1931, Emerson developed an oxygen tent which incorporated an improved cooling system.

Work on the iron lung
Emerson's father encouraged him to work on an artificial respirator after noticing the beginning of a polio epidemic. Emerson thus began his work on the iron lung in the early 1930s, improving the design of the Drinker lung. Completed in July 1931, Emerson's lung was quieter, lighter, more efficient, and cheaper. With a $1000 price tag, it sold for less than half the price of Drinker's make. Drinker threatened legal action against Emerson, and later filed a lawsuit which backfired. Drinker not only lost the suit, his patents were declared invalid.

Emerson's new design replaced blowers and valves with a flexible diaphragm in a dual layer. This acted as a failsafe: if one layer was torn, the second would continue operation. He also made improvements to the chamber. The first example of this design, nicknamed ""Old Number One"", is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Emerson continued to make improvements to the iron lung, adding a quick opening and closing function, an improved pressure gauge, and emergency hand operation. His final improvement was the addition of a transparent positive pressure dome, allowing ventilation when the chamber was opened to care for the patient.

Later inventions
In the mid-1940s, following a suggestion of Dr. Alvin Barach, Emerson perfected the Thunberg barospirator, which caused respiration without moving the lungs at all. Emerson was involved with the development of high-altitude flight valves and SCUBA gear for the Navy shortly before World War II.  In 1942 he developed an automatic resuscitator.  In 1949 he developed a mechanical assistor for anesthesia with the cooperation of the anesthesia department at Harvard.  In 1955 he built a pleural suction pump for postoperative thoracic surgery, the Emerson Postop Pump, which is still widely used.  Late in the twentieth century he assisted Alvin Barach in developing the ""In-Exsufflator Cough Machine"", a device to aid in secretion removal in patients with neuromuscular disease.

Relatives
Emerson was the brother of Robert Emerson the scientist who discovered that plants have two photoreaction centers. Emerson was the great-grandson of the brother of  Ralph Waldo Emerson. His uncle was the illustrator Maxfield Parrish.
His first cousin was Bartram “Bart” Kelley, also a nephew of Maxfield Parrish, who was a major designer of military helicopters for Bell Aircraft and Bell Helicopter.

Patent images
For the lawsuit involving the iron lung, images were lacking on some of the old patents.  New drawings were supplied to Emerson by his cousin, Maxfield Parrish Jr.

451,12415416,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam%20%28dentistry%29,Amalgam (dentistry),"Dental amalgam is a liquid mercury and metal alloy mixture used in dentistry to fill cavities caused by tooth decay. Low-copper amalgam commonly consists of mercury (50%), silver (~22–32%), tin (~14%), zinc (~8%) and other trace metals.

Dental amalgams were first documented in a Tang Dynasty medical text written by Su Gong (苏恭) in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528. In the 1800s, amalgam became the dental restorative material of choice due to its low cost, ease of application, strength, and durability.

In July 2018 the EU prohibited amalgam for dental treatment of children under 15 years and of pregnant or breastfeeding women.

History of use 
There are, according to Geir Bjørklund, indications that dental amalgam was used in the first part of the Tang Dynasty in China (AD 618–907), and in Germany by Strockerus in about 1528. Evidence of a dental amalgam first appears in the Tang Dynasty medical text Xinxiu bencao《新修本草》 written by Su Gong (苏恭) in 659, manufactured from tin and silver. Historical records hint that the use of amalgams may date to even earlier in the Tang Dynasty. It was during the Ming Dynasty that the composition of an early dental amalgam was first published, and a text written by Liu Wentai in 1505 states that it consists of ""100 shares of mercury, 45 shares of silver and 900 shares of tin."" Ever since its introduction in the Western world in the 1830s, amalgam has been the subject of recurrent controversies because of its mercury content. Early amalgam was made by mixing mercury with the filings of silver coins. In 1833 Englishmen, Edward Crawcour and his nephew Moses Crawcour (incorrectly referred to as ""the Crawcour brothers""), brought amalgam to the United States, and in 1844 it was reported that fifty percent of all dental restorations placed in upstate New York consisted of amalgam. However, at that point the use of dental amalgam was declared to be malpractice, and the American Society of Dental Surgeons (ASDS), the only US dental association at the time, forced all of its members to sign a pledge to abstain from using the mercury fillings. This was the beginning of what is known as the first dental amalgam war. The dispute ended in 1856 with the disbanding of the old association. The American Dental Association (ADA) was founded in its place in 1859, which has since then strongly defended dental amalgam from allegations of being too risky from the health standpoint.

Low copper to high copper amalgam alloy 
Amalgam has been used for many years for restorations, commonly known as fillings. Prior to 1900 many compositions were tried but few were successful when placed in the oral environment. Around 1900, small amounts of copper and occasionally zinc were added. Zinc acts as a scavenger because it prevents oxidation of the other metals in the alloy during the manufacturing process. Zinc accomplishes this by combining readily with oxygen to form zinc oxide. Amalgam restorations made from this balanced formula were reasonably successful and its longevity increased. However, one disadvantage that remained was fracture at the tooth-amalgam interface commonly called marginal fracture. Sn8Hg (γ2 phase) was considered to be responsible for this problem. This phase has been shown to be the weakest phase in the set amalgam and is subject to corrosion, particularly at the tooth-amalgam interface.

In 1962 a new amalgam alloy, called Dispersalloy, was introduced with the addition of a spherical silver-copper eutectic particle to the traditional lathe-cut Ag3Sn particle in a ratio of 1:2. The mixture of these two types of particles is known as admix alloy. This alloy strengthened the set amalgam and reduced the γ2 phase (Sn8Hg). The increased copper in the silver-copper eutectic reacted preferentially with tin so that Sn8Hg could not form. Early results from the clinical use of this new amalgam showed an improvement in marginal integrity. About 10 years later, another alloy, called Tytin, was introduced by adding significant amount of Cu3Sn together with Ag3Sn, in the form of a unicompositional spherical particle to eliminate the  γ2  phase. Both of these relatively new alloys raised the copper content from 5%, present in the older balanced composition alloy, to about 13% for the newer alloys.

Composition 
Dental amalgam is produced by mixing liquid mercury with an alloy made of silver, tin, and copper solid particles. Small quantities of zinc, mercury and other metals may be present in some alloys. This combination of solid particles is known as amalgam alloy. The composition of the alloy particles are controlled by the ISO Standard (ISO 1559) for dental amalgam alloy in order to control properties of set amalgam such as corrosion and setting expansion. It is important to differentiate between dental amalgam and the amalgam alloy that is commercially produced and marketed as small filings, spheroid particles, or a combination of these, suitable for mixing with liquid mercury to produce the dental amalgam. Amalgam is used most commonly for direct, permanent, posterior restorations and for large foundation restorations, or cores, which are precursors to placing crowns.

The reaction between mercury and alloy when mixed together is termed an amalgamation reaction. It will result in the formation of a silver-grey workable mass which can be condensed into cavities. After condensing, the dental amalgam is carved to generate the required anatomical features and then hardens with time. The standard composition of alloy prior to 1986 is referred to as conventional amalgam alloy. More recently (post-1986), there has been a change in the compositional standard of the alloy due to better understanding of structure-property relationships for the materials. Conventional amalgam alloy commonly consists of silver (~65% ), tin (~29%), copper (~8%) and other trace metals; current amalgam alloy consists of silver (40%), tin (32%), copper (30%) and other metals.

Metallurgy of amalgam 
To fabricate an amalgam filling, the dentist uses a mixing device to blend roughly equal parts (by mass) of shavings of a silver-base alloy with mercury until the shavings are thoroughly wetted. The silver alloy is typically 40–70% Ag, 25-29% Sn, 2–40% Cu and 0–2% Zn (when the alloy is formulated Zn is a scavenger and is mostly consumed during melting and lost as oxide). The dentist packs the plastic mass, before it sets, into the cavity. The amalgam expands ≈0.1% over 6–8 hours on setting.

The final structure is a metal matrix composite, where γ1, η and γ2 phases, are a matrix for unreacted original alloy, minus the fast-reacting β-phase and excess Sn.

Properties of amalgam 
Amalgam is a mixture of two or more metals (alloy) with mercury which has been purified first by distillation to remove impurities. Currently, major components of the alloy are silver, tin, and copper. The composition of the alloy powder is controlled by ISO standard for dental amalgam alloy (ISO 1559) to control the properties of amalgam.

Plastic deformation (creep) 
Creep or plastic deformation happens when subjected to intra-oral stresses such as chewing or grinding. Creep causes the amalgam to flow and protrudes from the margin of the cavity forming unsupported edges. ""Ditch"" is formed around the margins of the amalgam restoration after fracture due to amalgam creep at the occlusal margins. The γ2 phase of amalgam is primarily responsible for high values of creep.

Corrosion 
Corrosion occurs when an anode and cathode are set up in the presence of electrolytes, creating an electrolytic cell. The multiphase structure of dental amalgam can contribute as an anode or cathode with saliva as electrolytes. Corrosion may significantly affect the structure and mechanical properties of set dental amalgam. In conventional amalgam, γ2 phase is the most reactive and readily forms an anode. It will break down releasing corrosion products and mercury. Some of the mercury will combine rapidly with unreacted alloy and some will be ingested. The chances of ditching are further increased. Copper-enriched amalgams contain little or no γ2 phase. The copper–tin phase, which replaces γ2 in these materials, is still the most corrosion-prone phase in the amalgam. The corrosion however is still much lower than conventional amalgam.

In spite of that, it is thought that corrosion actually offers a clinical advantage. The corrosion products will gather at the tooth-amalgam interface and fill the microgap (marginal gap) which helps to decrease microleakage. Even so, there are no reports of increased marginal leakage for the copper-enriched amalgams indicating that sufficient quantities of corrosion product are produced to seal the margins.

Microleakage is the leakage of minute amounts of fluids, debris, and microorganisms through the microscopic space between a dental restoration and the adjacent surface of the cavity preparation. Microleakage can risk recurrent caries.

Strength 
An amalgam restoration develops its strength slowly and may take up to 24 hours or longer to reach a reasonably high value. At the time when the patient is dismissed from the surgery, typically some 15–20 minutes after placing the filling, the amalgam is relatively weak. Therefore, dentists need to instruct patients not to apply undue stress to their freshly placed amalgam fillings.

In addition, amalgam restorations are brittle and susceptible to corrosion.

Amalgam's setting reaction 
γ  : Ag3Sn (mechanically the strongest)
γ1 : Ag2Hg3 (major matrix phase in set amalgam)
γ2 : Sn8Hg (weakest phase, corrodes easily)
β  : Ag5Sn 
η' : Cu6Sn5
ε  : Cu3Sn

The alloys are broadly classified as low-copper (5% or less copper) and high-copper alloys (13% to 30% copper). The solid particles of the alloy are either spherical or irregularly shaped microspheres of various sizes or a combination of the two. The low-copper alloys have either irregular or spherical particles. High-copper alloys contain either spherical particles of the same composition (unicompositional) or a mixture of irregular and spherical particles of different or the same composition (admixed). The properties of set amalgam depends upon the alloy composition—particle size, shape and distribution—and heat treatment controls the characteristic properties of the amalgam.

Low copper alloy 
During trituration, mercury diffuses into the silver-tin particles. Then, silver and tin dissolve, to a very limited extent, into the mercury. As this occurs, the particles become smaller. Because the solubility of both silver and tin in mercury is limited and because silver is much less soluble in mercury than is tin, silver precipitates out first as silver-mercury (γ1) followed by tin in the form of tin-mercury (γ2). The set amalgam consists of unreacted gamma particles surrounded by a matrix of gamma 1 and gamma 2. The amalgamation is summarised as follows:
 
Ag3Sn, Ag5Sn + Hg → Ag2Hg3 + Sn8Hg + Ag3Sn

i.e. (γ + β) + Hg → γ1 + γ2 +  γ

High copper alloy
In high copper alloy, copper is added to improve mechanical properties, resistance to corrosion and marginal integrity. The higher copper is supplied by either the silver-copper eutectic or the Cu3Sn (ε) phase. The fact that tin had a greater affinity for copper than for mercury meant that the gamma-2 phase was reduced or eliminated. This resulted in the dramatic improvement in physical properties. The higher copper content is supplied as two types:
 High copper admix alloy (spherical particles of the silver-copper eutectic alloy to a low-copper lathe-cut alloy in a ratio of 1:2)
 Uni/single-composition alloy

Admix alloy setting reaction 
During trituration, the dissolved silver from the silver-tin particles reacts, as in low copper alloys, to form the γ1 phase. The dissolved tin migrates to the outside of the silver-copper particles to form Cu6Sn5, the eta prime (η′) phase of the copper-tin system. Thus, copper reacts with sufficient tin to prevent the formation of γ2. The amalgamation reaction may be simplified as follows (notice the absence of γ2 phase):

γ(Ag3Sn) + Ag-Cu (eutectic) + Hg → γ1 (Ag2Hg3)+ η ′ (Cu6Sn5)+ unreacted γ (Ag3Sn) + unreacted Ag-Cu (eutectic)

Uni/single composition alloy 
Here, the alloy particles contain both Ag3Sn(γ) and Cu3Sn(ε), similar to the low-copper lathe-cut alloys, but with much greater amount of the Cu3Sn(ε) phase. These alloys are usually spherical. When liquid mercury is mixed with these alloys, it diffuses into the surface of these particles forming Ag2Hg3 as well as Cu6Sn5.

γ(Ag3Sn) + ɛ(Cu3Sn) + Hg → γ1 (Ag2Hg3) + η ′ (Cu6Sn5) + unreacted [γ (Ag3Sn)+ ɛ (Cu3Sn )]

The difference in eta prime phase of admixed alloy and unicomposition alloy is that in unicomposition alloy, Cu6Sn5 crystals are much larger and rod-shaped than those in admixed alloy. Copper added in unicomposition causes removal of the gamma2 phase.

Advantages of high copper compared to low copper alloy 
 Better corrosion resistance.
 Less susceptible to creep.
 Greater strength.
 Less tarnish and corrosion.
 Greater longevity.

Amalgam vs. polymer resins 
Amalgam is tolerant to a wide range of clinical placement conditions and moderately tolerant to the presence of moisture during placement. In contrast, the techniques for composite resin placement are more sensitive to many factors.

Mercury has properties of a bacteriostatic agent whereas certain methacrylate polymers (for example TEGMA, triethylene glycol methacrylate) composing the matrix of resin composites ""encourages the growth of microorganisms"". In the Casa Pia study in Portugal (1986–1989), 1,748 posterior restorations were placed and 177 (10.1%) of them failed during the course of the study. Recurrent marginal decay was the main reason for failure in both amalgam and composite restorations, accounting for 66% (32/48) and 88% (113/129), respectively. Polymerization shrinkage, the shrinkage that occurs during the composite curing process, has been implicated as the primary reason for postoperative marginal leakage.

However, there is low-quality evidence to suggest that resin composites lead to higher failure rates and risk of secondary caries than amalgam restorations. Several reviews have been made by using database in the Cochrane Library where randomized controlled trials of few studies comparing dental resin composite with dental amalgams in permanent posterior teeth were compared. This review supports the fact that amalgam restorations are particularly useful and successful in parts of the world where amalgam is still the material of choice to restore posterior teeth with proximal caries. Though, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects amalgam may have on patients, new research is unlikely to change opinion on its safety and due to the decision for a global phase-down of amalgam (Minamata Convention on Mercury) general opinion on its safety is unlikely to change.

These are some of the reasons why amalgam has remained a superior restorative material over resin-base composites.  The New England Children's Amalgam Trial (NECAT), a randomized controlled trial, yielded results ""consistent with previous reports suggesting that the longevity of amalgam is higher than that of resin-based compomer in primary teeth and composites in permanent teeth. Compomers were seven times as likely to require replacement and composites were seven times as likely to require repair. There are circumstances in which composite serves better than amalgam. For example, when a more conservative preparation would be beneficial, composite is the recommended restorative material. These situations would include small occlusal restorations, in which amalgam would require the removal of more sound tooth structure, as well as in ""enamel sites beyond the height of contour"". For cosmetic purposes, composite is preferred when a restoration is required on an immediately visible portion of a tooth.

Bonded amalgam 
Dental amalgam does not by itself bond to tooth structure. This was recognized as a shortcoming by early practitioners such as Baldwin. He recommended that the prepared cavity be coated with zinc phosphate cement just prior to filling with amalgam, in order to improve the seal and retention. The practice did not become universally accepted and eventually fell into disuse. Until the 1980s, most amalgam restorations placed worldwide were done without adhesives, although in the 1970s a polycarboxylate-based adhesive liner was formulated specifically for this purpose  In the mid-1980s the first reports of the use of resins to bond amalgam to etched tooth structure, much like is done for composite resins, appeared in the literature. Since then, a number of papers have been published on laboratory as well as clinical studies of the technique. For large cavity restorations, features such as pins, slots, holes and grooves can be used for the retention of large amalgam restorations, but they do not reinforce the amalgam or increase its strength.

There is no current scientific evidence to justify the extra cost and effort associated with the use of adhesively bonded amalgam restorations in comparison with nonbonded amalgam restorations. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam compared with nonbonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred.

Liners and bases
The placement of amalgam restorations can potentially cause sensitivity post-operatively. According to R. Weiner, a protective layer or liner should be placed prior to the placement of amalgam to act as a buffer, helping to reduce sensitivity to the tooth. There are different liners that can be used in dental practices today, many of which contain zinc. Examples of lining materials include zinc oxide eugenol, zinc phosphate, glass ionomer cement, zinc poly-carboxylate and resin.

Sealing amalgam restorations 
A varnish can be applied to the cavity wall to provide a good marginal seal. The varnish should be insoluble in water and is usually composed of a resin in a volatile solvent. When applied to the cavity, the solvent evaporates, leaving the resin behind to seal the dentinal tubules. The amalgam can then be packed into the cavity.

Dental amalgam toxicity 

Concerns have been raised about the potential for mercury poisoning with dental amalgam when used  in a dental filling. Major health and professional organizations regard amalgam as safe but questions have been raised and acute but rare allergic reactions have been reported.

Critics argue that it has toxic effects that make it unsafe, both for the patient and perhaps even more so for the dental professional manipulating it during a restoration. A study by the Life Sciences Research Office found that studies on mercury vapor and dental amalgam ""provided insufficient information to enable definitive conclusions."" They identified several ""research gaps"", including: ""well-controlled studies using standardized measures that evaluate whether low level [mercury vapor exposures] produce neurotoxic and/or neuropsychological effect"", studies on ""co-exposure to HgO and methylmercury"", studies on ""in utero exposure to HgO"", ""occupational studies on [pregnant workers] with well-defined HgO exposure"", studies on the absorption of Hg2+ by the ""human neonatal gut from breast milk"", studies on ""whether dental professionals have increased incidences of kidney disease, emotional instability, erethrism, pulmonary dysfunction, or other characteristics of occupational HgO exposure"", studies on whether there exist ""potential gender differences"" or ""genetic basis for sensitivity to mercury exposure."" The removal of amalgam fillings is not recommended for reasons other than a true hypersensitivity to mercury. Mercury levels in blood and urine have been shown to rise for a short period of time following the removal of amalgam restorations and no studies have demonstrated any health gain from restoration removal. Removal involves exposure to mercury vapor released during the removal process. Amalgams also contribute to mercury toxicity in the environment. With regard to amalgam placement and removal in pregnancy, research has not shown any adverse effects for the mother or fetus. However, research is inadequate to determine the chance of harm occurring and therefore placement and removal should be avoided during pregnancy if possible.

In response to The Minamata Convention on Mercury, the European Commission has confirmed its position that individual nations should work to gradually scale down the use of dental amalgam.

Environmental impact and prevention of amalgam poisoning 
Dental amalgam is thought to be relatively safe to be used as a restorative material as it is used in low doses. Amalgam vapour can be released through chewing but this is minimal. However, there is an increased release of mercury following the exposure of electromagnetic fields generated by MRI machines. Some patients may develop allergic reactions to it. Resin composite, glass ionomer cements and ceramic or gold inlays can be used as alternatives to amalgam.

U.S. amalgam disposal regulation 

In the United States, dental offices have typically disposed of amalgam waste down the drain. The wastewater is sent to the local sewage treatment plant, which is not designed to treat or recycle mercury or other heavy metals. The mercury contaminates the sludge processed at the treatment plant, and thereby can spread the mercury in surrounding communities, if the sludge is land-applied for disposal. Dental amalgam is the largest source of mercury received by U.S. treatment plants.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing dental amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices in the U.S. are required to use an amalgam separator in their drain system. The separator captures the waste material, which is then recycled.

EU amalgam disposal regulation 
The European Commission has issued a Waste Directive that classifies amalgam waste as a hazardous waste. The waste should be separated from other waste by fitting amalgam separators in all dental practices.

Avoidance in pregnant women 
Mercury can cross the placenta leading to stillbirths and birth defects. Although there is no evidence linking amalgam use and pregnancy damage, it is advisable to delay or avoid dealing with amalgam fillings in pregnant patients.

Awareness among dentists 
The dental operating team should deal with amalgam with proper use of personal protective equipment to protect themselves. A popular methodology for removal and replacement is the Safe Mercury Amalgam Removal Technique or S.M.A.R.T. protocol.

The Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC).  They play their home matches on the Mark Bostick Golf Course on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and are currently led by head coach J. C. Deacon.  In the eighty-nine-year history of the Gators' men's golf program, they have won fifteen SEC championships and four NCAA national tournament championships.

History 

The Gators men's golf program was the fifth intercollegiate sports team established by the University of Florida, having begun competition in 1925.  The Gators won their first two Southeastern Conference team championships twenty years later under coach Andrew Bracken in 1955 and coach Conrad Rehling in 1956.  Those two SEC championship teams produced future PGA Tour members Doug Sanders, Tommy Aaron and Dave Ragan.  Rehling's Gators also produced three back-to-back individual SEC titles: Ragan (1956) and Aaron (1957, 1958).

Bishop era: 1964–78 

Physical education professor and former high school football coach Buster Bishop became the new head coach of the Gators golf team in 1964.  Improvement came quickly for Bishop's Gators, and they finished as the SEC runners-up in 1965.  Gator Bob Murphy won the individual NCAA national title in 1966.  And in 1967, the team finished second in the conference behind the LSU Tigers, and second in the nation behind the Houston Cougars at the NCAA championship tournament.

The 1968 Gators made history; they not only won the program's third SEC team championship, they won the NCAA championship tournament by edging the defending national champion Houston Cougars by two shots.  The Gators' 1968 NCAA men's golf championship, won by John Darr, Steve Melnyk, John Sale, Richard Spears, Robert Baggs and Wendell Coffee, was the first national team championship in any sport ever won by a team from the University of Florida.

Bishop's Gators won another NCAA national team championship 1973, with an all-star team of four future PGA Tour members: Gary Koch, Andy Bean, Ben Duncan, Woody Blackburn and Phil Hancock.  The 1973 Gators outpaced the second-place Oklahoma State Cowboys by ten strokes in the NCAA championship tournament.  The following year, the Gators finished second by two strokes behind the Wake Forest Demon Deacons at the 1974 NCAA championship tournament.

Bishop's teams also won three back-to-back SEC team championships in 1973, 1974 and 1975.  Only once in fifteen seasons did his Gators finish worse than third in the ten-team SEC.  Bishop retired from coaching after the 1978 season.

Darr and Blevins: 1979–87 

John Darr, a junior letterman from the Gators' 1968 national championship team, followed Bishop as the team's coach in 1979 and 1980.  In his two seasons, Darr's Gators finished second and third in the SEC, and fifteenth and tenth nationally at the NCAA championship tournament.  Gator golfer Rick Pearson won the individual SEC title in 1980.  Lynn Blevins served as the Gators' coach from 1981 to 1987; his teams won an SEC team championship in 1985, and were the SEC runners-up in 1986.  Blevins' Gators finished third in the nation at the 1985 NCAA championship tournament, which they hosted on their home course.

Alexander era: 1988–2014 

The Gators' current head coach, Buddy Alexander, was hired for the 1988 season.  Alexander's 1993 team of Guy Hill, Chris Couch, Brian Gay, Bread Lehman and John Pettit won another national championship, besting second-place Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets by a single shot at the NCAA championship tournament.  His 2001 team won the program's fourth NCAA national championship, with Gators Nick Gilliam, Camilo Benedetti, Bubba Dickerson, Camilo Villegas and Ben Banks dominating the runner-up Clemson Tigers by eighteen strokes.  Team captain Gilliam also won the second individual NCAA men's golf championship in Gators history in 2001, and teammate Benedetti finished second in the NCAA championship tournament, three strokes behind Gilliam.

Alexander's Gators won eight SEC team championships (1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1999, 2003, 2011), and finished second in the conference seven times.  Nationally, his teams won two NCAA national championships (1993, 2001), and finished second twice (1990, 2006).  The Gators have failed to qualify for the NCAA championship tournament only twice in his twenty-six seasons.

Individual honors 

In the past fifty-eight years, fifteen Gators golfers have won twenty-one SEC individual titles.  Thirty-nine Gators golfers have earned sixty-seven first-team All-SEC honors.  Forty-nine Gators have received ninety-three All-American honors.  Two Gators have won the individual NCAA national title: Bob Murphy (1966), and Nick Gilliam (2001).

Four Gators have won U.S. Amateur Championship: Bob Murphy (1965), Steve Melnyk (1969), Fred Ridley (1975), and Bubba Dickerson (2001).  The Gators' former head coach, Buddy Alexander, won the U.S. Amateur in 1986.  Melnyk won the British Amateur in 1971.

PGA Tour professionals 

Over thirty former University of Florida alumni have represented the university on the PGA Tour, including former Gators golfers Tommy Aaron, winner of the 1973 Masters Tournament and two other Tour events, Mark Calcavecchia, winner of the 1989 British Open and thirteen other Tour events, Andy North, winner of the 1978 and 1985 U.S. Opens and one other Tour event, and Doug Sanders, winner of twenty Tour events.

Coaching staff 

J. C. Deacon is the head coach of the Florida Gators men's golf team; 2014–15 will be his first season with the Gators.  Deacon previously served as an assistant golf coach for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he worked with the UNLV Rebels men's golf team for four years.

Mark Bostick Golf Course 

The Gators men's golf team host its home matches at the Mark Bostick Golf Course, located on  of the university's campus in Gainesville, Florida.  The university course was originally designed by noted Scottish golfer and golf course architect Donald Ross in 1921.  It was partially redesigned and rebuilt by noted golf architect Bobby Weed as part of a $4 million renovation project in 2001.  The renovated course is a 6,701-yard par 70, and the facilities include the Guy Bostick club house and dedicated practice areas for the Gators golf teams.

The Mark Bostick Golf Course hosts the annual Gator Invitational, as well as the annual Gator Golf Day alumni event.

455,1049922,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Barracuda-class%20submarine%20%281951%29,United States Barracuda-class submarine (1951),"The Barracuda-class submarines (originally the K-1-class submarines) were the product of Project Kayo, a research and development effort begun immediately after World War II by the United States Navy to ""solve the problem of using submarines to attack and destroy enemy submarines."" They originally had the hull classification symbol SSK, for ""hunter-killer submarine"". It was known that the Soviet Navy had acquired the German Type XXI U-boat and other advanced submarines, and was expected to rapidly put derivatives of them into production. In 1948 the US Navy prepared estimates of the number of anti-submarine warfare (ASW)-capable submarines (SSKs) that would be needed to counter the hundreds of advanced Soviet submarines that were expected to be in service by 1960. Two scenarios were considered: a reasonable scenario assuming the Soviets would build to their existing force level of about 360 submarines, and a ""nightmare"" scenario projecting that the Soviets could build submarines as fast as the Germans had built U-boats, with a force level of 2,000 submarines. The projected US SSK force levels for these scenarios were 250 for the former and 970 for the latter. By comparison, the total US submarine force at the end of World War II, excluding obsolescent training submarines, was just over 200 boats.

These submarines were originally named K-1 through K-3, with hull numbers SSK-1 through SSK-3. They were renamed Barracuda, Bass, and Bonita in December 1955. In 1959 Barracuda was redesignated SST-3 (SST for training submarine), and in 1964 her main sonar was removed. A final redesignation twist was SS-T3 in 1973; for some reason the Navy wished to list her as an attack submarine. Bass was decommissioned in 1957 and redesignated SS-551 in 1959. Bonita was decommissioned in 1958 and redesignated SS-552 in 1959.

Design

The Barracuda-class SSKs were designed to be smaller than contemporary attack submarines and simpler in design and construction.  It was hoped that this would allow them to be cheaply mass-produced in the large numbers it was thought would be needed to combat the growing Soviet Type XXI-derived submarine fleet.  It was also thought that this would allow shipyards without submarine experience, and aircraft contractors with experience in the mass production of large complex aircraft, to build these submarines.

The primary innovation created by Kayo was a low-frequency passive bow sonar system, the BQR-4, which was originally to be wrapped around the submarine's conning tower. Testing on  showed that self-noise would greatly reduce detection range, and the sonar was relocated to the bow. Due to the large sonar dome above the torpedo tubes, in the Barracuda-class the torpedo tubes remained in their traditional bow position.

Service

In 1951-53 the Barracudas were joined by seven converted Gato-class SSKs. These lost four of their six bow torpedo tubes and two of their four main diesel engines.

The advent of nuclear power, with  entering service in 1955 and the Soviet Navy responding with the first November-class submarine only three years later, created a revolution in ASW. Nuclear submarines could maintain a high speed at deep depths indefinitely. The conventional SSKs would be useless against nuclear-powered boats, except possibly in shallow water. As nuclear attack submarines were developed and deployed, they took up the ASW mission. All ten SSKs were redesignated and decommissioned or reassigned to other duties in 1957-59.

The SSK program and particularly the Barracuda class were thus overtaken by events after a few years' service. Their sonar, however, proved excellent, with good convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines; it was retained on the former Gato-class SSKs and fitted on the first nuclear submarines and a few additional diesel submarines. The bow sonar array eventually became a bow sonar sphere, with angled, amidships torpedo tubes to make room for it in the Thresher class and all subsequent US SSN classes.

In 1958 Bonita was used as a nuclear weapons testing target at Eniwetok in the South Pacific, part of Operation Hardtack I.  Fortunately, this was designed as shock testing rather than destructive testing, and damage was light except to electronics.

456,18456896,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick%20Jordan%20%28politician%29,Nick Jordan (politician),"Nick Jordan (born 1949) is an American Republican politician who was formerly a member of the Kansas State Senate for the 10th District, which is centered on Shawnee, Kansas. He was also the unsuccessful Republican candidate for  in 2008, losing to Democratic incumbent Dennis Moore.  When Moore decided not to run for another term in 2010, Jordan briefly ran for the seat once again before dropping out. Jordan was nominated by Governor-elect Sam Brownback to serve as his Secretary of Revenue. His nomination was confirmed by the State Senate.

Early life
Jordan was born in 1949 and is a lifelong Kansan.  Jordan started his career as a busboy, eventually becoming a hotel manager and founding president of the Overland Park Convention and Visitors Bureau. Jordan has a 40-year career in the travel and tourism industry. Jordan has been married to his wife Linda for over 25 years; together they have a daughter and three grandchildren.

State senator
In 1995, Jordan was selected by Republican precinct committee people and appointed by then-Gov. Bill Graves to fill the seat vacated by a former state senator. Succeeding that, Jordan was reelected without serious opposition. One of the more powerful and influential senators in Kansas, Jordan served as chairman of numerous committees. He was the chairman of the Joint Committee on Economic Development and co-chairman of the Commerce Committee. Jordan retired in 2008 to run for Congress.

Education voting record
Jordan, like most Johnson County representatives, has continually voted against increasing education funding statewide. This insistence eventually led the Kansas City Star to endorse his 2004 opponent saying Jordan ""can't be counted on to make tough votes raising money for our schools"".

2008 congressional race
Jordan informally entered the congressional race in August 2007. Upon his entry, the Kansas City Star noted Jordan claimed to have united the divided factions, the social conservatives and the economic conservatives, that have split the Republican Party in the recent past.    The Kansas City Star concluded that he would be a formidable challenger to Moore in the 3rd, which has traditionally been the heartland of moderate Kansas Republicans.  Steve Rose, publisher of The Johnson County Sun, however, has highlighted Jordan's consistently conservative voting record saying, ""He votes with the right-wing crowd on education, embryonic stem cell research, and all the other hot-button right-wing issues. I know Nick Jordan, and he is no moderate."" According to Jordan's website, his top campaign issues include making health care more accessible, keeping the economy strong and returning integrity back to Congress.

Jordan lost to Moore but garnered more than 142,000 votes. Mary Pilcher-Cook replaced him in the state senate. He then became a director with Cohen-Esrey Real Estate Services in Mission, Kansas.  He announced his intention to run for the seat again in 2010 but left the race a few months later before the primary election had occurred.
Jordan, as Secretary of Revenue, leads the $40 million effort to upgrade the DMS software in Kansas.  This system was implemented in May 2012 and it caused major problems for the county offices responsible for processing vehicle titles and registrations.

History
The Glen Rock Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

Glen Rock was founded on August 29, 1859. It started in 1837 with William Heathcote — a native of Cheshire, England, who moved to Pennsylvania in 1826.

Heathcote noted the area's water power potential and bought a farm with an abandoned sawmill from a local farmer. He then built a brick woolen mill on the sawmill's foundation. Farmers and mill workers began to populate the surrounding area, and the arrival of the first passenger train soon afterward provided a way for them to ship their goods to large nearby cities.

Life in Glen Rock boomed throughout the 1840s with the introduction of a post office, church, iron foundry and machine shop. But the area didn't officially become a borough until August 29, 1859, the year after the 200 residents petitioned local courts for incorporation.

Geography
Glen Rock is located at  (39.793471, -76.731520).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land.

Demographics

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,809 people (2,025 in the 2010 census), 708 households (785 in the 2010 census), and 506 families (543 in the 2010 census) living in the borough.  The racial makeup of the borough was 98.07% White(96.1% in the 2010 census), 1.00% African American(2.9% in the 2010 census), 0.17% Native American, 0.33% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, and 0.39% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.44% of the population (2.3% in the 2010 census).

There were 708 households (785 in the 2010 census) out of which 38.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them (36.3% in the 2010 census), 55.4% were married couples living together, 11.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.5% were non-families. 23.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.04.

In the borough the population was spread out, with 29.0% under the age of 18, 6.7% from 18 to 24, 33.9% from 25 to 44, 19.2% from 45 to 64, and 11.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 99.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.5 males.

The carolers, a group of 50+ men, sing in three-part harmony and are accompanied by instruments, currently trumpets and trombones. Most of the carols sung are old English or old American and are not commonly heard anymore; only four carols have been added since 1900. The carolers themselves are recognized by their distinctive uniform consisting of gray high hats, greatcoats, gloves, and multi-color scarves. A concert given at 10:45 pm on Christmas Eve regularly attracts a crowd of around 1,000.

Recreation
The Heritage Rail Trail County Park is a National Recreation Trail rail-with-trail in Pennsylvania built in 1999 by the York County Rail Trail Authority (YCRTA). It connects with the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail in Maryland. The trail runs along the active Northern Central Railway line and forms the southernmost part of Route J in the BicyclePA route system.

The rail trail runs north through the borough intersecting Valley, Main and Water Streets. The rail line is active with passenger freight from Steam Into History located in nearby New Freedom, Pennsylvania.

The Glen Rock Park is located at 5400 Fair School Road adjacent to the Borough. The park features a dog park, two ball fields, playground equipment, basketball and volleyball court, restroom facilities and pavilions available for rent. The park is managed by the Glen Rock recreation board.

458,43427422,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29,Utopia (Australian TV series),"Utopia, internationally titled Dreamland, is a Logie Award-winning Australian television comedy series by Working Dog Productions that premiered on the ABC on 13 August 2014.  The series follows the working lives of a team in the fictional Nation Building Authority, a newly created government organisation. The Authority is responsible for overseeing major infrastructure projects, from announcement to unveiling.  The series explores the collision between bureaucracy and grand ambitions. The second series aired in 2015, beginning with the first episode on 19 August 2015. The third series aired in 2017, beginning with the first episode on 19 July 2017. The fourth series aired in 2019, beginning on 21 August 2019.  No word as yet if a fifth season has been comissioned or produced.

Plot
The series is set inside the offices of the fictional Nation Building Authority, a newly created government organisation responsible for overseeing major infrastructure projects ranging from new roads and rail lines to airports and high rise urban developments. It follows the working lives of a tight-knit team of bureaucrats in charge of guiding big building schemes from announcement to unveiling. Throughout the series grand projects are frustrated by self-interest, publicity stunts, constant shifts in political priorities and bureaucracy.

The series features a number of recurring themes. The office is continually focused on various fads. In one episode, staff become obsessed with exercise after a visit from a Heart Smart representative, practicing communal yoga in the office at regular intervals. In another episode, Amy (Davidson) hires an indoor plant consultant, making major changes to office air conditioning and lighting, after Tony's (Sitch) plant dies and he asks for a replacement. 

Rhonda (Flanagan) frequently attends conferences or workshops on various forms of online media. She returns to the office enthusiastically and doggedly drawing priorities away from important projects to superficial online projects on how to engage more with their relevant ""audience"".

Background
Utopia is written and produced by three of the founding members of Working Dog Productions: Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner. It is produced by Michael Hirsh, directed by Sitch who also stars as one of the main characters Tony, and casting managed by Jane Kennedy. When casting, Sitch wanted to have actors that possessed a certain acting style, that appeared as if nothing absurd was going on. Sitch described the series as being about ""the currency of grand dreams"". He described that the idea of the ""Nation Building Authority"" was to portray it as one of those things that got set up in a bit of a mad rush and that under all the grand dreams there was a white elephant waiting to appear. Utopia continues on the satirical themes of other Working Dog works such as Frontline and The Hollowmen. Sitch also noted that the series was more observational than satirical and that it depicted how organisations may or may not function. When creating the show, Gleisner said the production team spoke to people who worked with government authorities and had experienced for themselves the daily unpredictabilities of working in these environments.

Characters 
Main cast
 Tony Woodford (Rob Sitch) is the CEO of the NBA, and is constantly exasperated by his inability to achieve anything other than meetings, studies and reports.

 Nat Russell (Celia Pacquola) is the Chief Operations Officer, and Tony's second in charge. The only other competent person in the office, she is just as frustrated as Tony.
 Scott Byrnes (Dave Lawson) is a project assistant, an enthusiastic guy who doesn't actually do much. He can sometimes be helpful to Tony.
 Rhonda Stewart (Kitty Flanagan) is the media manager. She forcefully pushes her narrow agenda, often based on some new fad, ignoring more important priorities.
 Katie Norris (Emma-Louise Wilson) is Tony's personal assistant. She constantly tries to be helpful but is somewhat incompetent.
 Hugh (Luke McGregor) is Nat's project assistant, who constantly reminds her of how difficult it is to do things. (Series 1–2)
 Amy (Michelle Lim Davidson) is the office receptionist, who is always positive and chirpy, but unable to see the big picture. (Series 1–2)

Reception
Anne Pender from The Conversation described Utopia as ""light – but sharp and witty"" political satire. She praised the talents of the writers and the cast of ""exceptional actors"". She also noted that it was an improvement from The Speechmaker, a stage show that Sitch and Working Dog Productions put together earlier in 2014. David Knox from TV Tonight noted the show's similarity to Sitch's previous work, The Hollowmen. In addition to praising the performances of cast members, he opined that the city backdrop of East Melbourne gave the series a ""fresh, contemporary feel"" accompanied by a ""driving percussion soundtrack"" and ""cityscape montages"". Ahmad Kahn from The Huffington Post drew comparisons with the earlier and more cynical seasons of American workplace comedies The Office and Parks and Recreation, as well as saying that Utopia offers a ""painfully funny satire that focuses on the interaction between the media and press friendly projects wanted by government administrations and the disparities it presents to those in the agency who would prefer practicality.""

Netflix purchased the rights to the program in 2015 to broadcast the first two series under the title Dreamland. Series 1 began airing on PBS in the USA on 21 July 2018.

It can be present in three forms: purely anterior (persistent tunica vasculosa lentis and persistent posterior fetal fibrovascular sheath of the lens), purely posterior (falciform retinal septum and ablatio falcicormis congenita) and a combination of both. Most examples of PHPV are unilateral and non-hereditary. When bilateral, PHPV may follow an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Symptoms
The primary vitreous used in formation of the eye during fetal development remains in the eye upon birth and is hazy and scarred. The symptoms are leukocoria, strabismus, nystagmus and blurred vision, blindness.

Causes
Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)
Norrie disease
Walker-Warburg syndrome
Autosomal dominant
Autosomal recessive

Diagnosis

Causes a 'white reflex' in the affected eye (leukocoria), prompting further investigation.

Treatment

Pars plana lensectomy with or without vitrectomy and trabeculectomy.

465,730312,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stansfield%20Turner,Stansfield Turner,"Stansfield Turner (December 1, 1923 January 18, 2018) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served as President of the Naval War College (1972–1974), commander of the United States Second Fleet (1974–1975), Supreme Allied Commander NATO Southern Europe (1975–1977), and was Director of Central Intelligence (1977–1981) under the Carter administration. A graduate of University of Oxford and the United States Naval Academy, Turner served for more than 30 years in the Navy, commanding warships, a carrier group, and NATO's military forces in southern Europe, among other commands.

Turner was appointed to lead the CIA by Jimmy Carter in 1977 and undertook a series of controversial reforms, including downsizing the Agency's clandestine arm and emphasizing technical intelligence collection over human intelligence. He also oversaw the CIA's responses to the Iranian Revolution and the Soviet–Afghan War. After leaving the CIA in 1981, Turner entered the private sector, authored several books, and criticized subsequent administrations, including the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War. He was a senior research scholar at the University of Maryland, College Park's School of Public Policy.

Early life and education
Turner was born in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, on December 1, 1923, to Oliver Stansfield Turner, a real estate broker, and Wilhelmina Josephine Wagner. He graduated from Highland Park High School in 1941 before attending Amherst College until 1943. After joining the United States Naval Reserve, he received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in 1943 as a member of the Class of 1947. While at Annapolis, he participated in the Navy Midshipmen football program as a guard. Although Turner and fellow transfer student Jimmy Carter were in the same class at the Academy, ""the two men barely knew each other at the time."" He received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and attained a commission in the United States Navy in June 1946 as part of an accelerated three-year curriculum, the result of World War II. He was a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford while serving in the Navy, earning an Oxbridge M.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1950. In 1966, he attended the six-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.

Military career
Upon commissioning as a naval officer, Turner served briefly aboard the escort carrier USS Palau and the light cruiser USS Dayton. After a brief leave of absence to attend Oxford, Turner returned to navy service and served as a gunnery officer aboard the destroyer USS Stribling and then the operations officer aboard the USS Hanson, taking part in shore bombardments in the closing months of the Korean War. From 1956 to 1958, he served as commanding officer of the ocean mine sweeper (MSO), USS Conquest, and later executive officer of the destroyer USS Morton (DD-948) in 1961 and 1962. Turner then served as commanding officer of the destroyer USS Rowan and the guided missile cruiser USS Horne (DLG-30), where he participated in combat operations off the coast of Vietnam.

He commanded Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 8 as a rear admiral, leading a task group in 1970–1971 consisting of the aircraft carriers Independence and John F. Kennedy monitoring the Soviet Fifth Eskadra in the Mediterranean. He then served as Director, Systems Analysis Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (1971–1972); President of the Naval War College (1972–1974); and Commander, United States Second Fleet, Naval Station Norfolk (1974–1975). After being promoted to admiral in 1975, Turner became NATO Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe, Naples where he served until his appointment to the CIA in 1977. Turner retired from active Navy duty on December 31, 1978.

Career

Central Intelligence Agency
In February 1977, Turner's nomination to become Director of Central Intelligence was announced by President Jimmy Carter, after allegations of improprieties tanked the earlier nomination of Ted Sorensen. After two days of hearings, Turner was unanimously confirmed to lead the Agency.

President Carter wanted reforms on the intelligence agencies, whose reputations were discredited due to the Watergate scandal (Church Commission), and other controversies that involved spying on citizens, against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in the United States, and international assassination plots (Human rights violations by the CIA). Turner sought to revamp the Agency in several ways, first appointing several high-ranking naval officers, known as the ""Navy mafia"", to leadership positions and also by fundamentally altering the Agency's traditional methods of intelligence collection. Under Turner's direction, the CIA emphasized technical intelligence (TECHINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT) over human intelligence (HUMINT). In 1979, Turner eliminated over 800 operational positions, most of them in the clandestine service, in what was dubbed the Halloween Massacre. In a memoir published in 2005, Turner expressed regret for the dismissals stating, ""In retrospect, I probably should not have effected the reductions of 820 positions at all, and certainly not the last 17."" The reductions applied to Vietnam-era personnel according to later-era employee and novelist Jason Matthews. Turner also oversaw the beginning of Operation Cyclone, the CIA's program to arm Afghan guerrillas in their fight against the Soviet Union.

During Turner's term as head of the CIA, he became outraged when former employee Frank Snepp published a book called Decent Interval which exposed incompetence among senior U.S. government personnel during the fall of Saigon. Turner accused Snepp of breaking the secrecy agreement required of all CIA employees, and then later was forced to admit under cross-examination that he had never read the agreement signed by Snepp. Regardless, the CIA ultimately won its case against Snepp at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court forced Snepp to turn over all his profits from Decent Interval and to seek preclearance of any future writings about intelligence work for the rest of his life. Ironically, the CIA would later rely on the Snepp legal precedent to force Turner to seek preclearance of his own memoirs, which were highly critical of President Ronald Reagan's policies.

On March 12, 1980, President Jimmy Carter and Turner presented Tony Mendez with the CIA's Intelligence Star for his role in the exfiltration of six U.S. State Department personnel from Iran on 28 January 1980.

Post-CIA activities
Upon leaving the agency, Turner became a lecturer, author, and TV commentator, and served on the boards of several American corporations, including Monsanto (1981–1991) and the National Life Group (1985–1992). Turner served as a member of the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography's Marine Advisory Council and the United States Naval Academy's Board of Visitors. He also wrote several books, including Secrecy and Democracy – The CIA in Transition (1985), Terrorism and Democracy (1991), Caging the Nuclear Genie – An American Challenge for Global Security (1997; revised edition, 1999), and 2005's Burn Before Reading: Presidents, CIA Directors, and Secret Intelligence, in which he advocated fragmenting the CIA.

Turner was sharply critical of the Bush administration's handling of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In September 2003 he wrote that ""most of the assumptions behind our invasion have been proven wrong: The intelligence did not support the imminence of a threat, the Iraqis have not broadly welcomed us as liberators, the idea that we could manage this action almost unilaterally is giving way to pleas for troops and money from other nations, the aversion to giving the U.N. a meaningful role is eroding daily, and the reluctance to get involved in nation building is being supplanted by just that."" In 2004, Turner was among 27 retired diplomats and military commanders who publicly said the administration of President Bush did not understand the world and was unable to handle ""in either style or substance"" the responsibilities of global leadership.

In November 2005, after Vice President Dick Cheney lobbied against a provision to a defense bill that Republican Senator John McCain passed in the Senate banning ""cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment"" of all U.S. detainees, Turner was quoted as saying, ""I am embarrassed that the USA has a vice president for torture. I think it is just reprehensible. He [Dick Cheney] advocates torture, what else is it? I just don't understand how a man in that position can take such a stance."" Cheney countered the bill that went well beyond banning torture and could be interpreted by courts to ban most forms of interrogation.

Turner served on the Military Advisors Committee for the Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, whose mission was to reduce the amount of the discretionary budget going to the military by 15 percent and reallocate that money to education, healthcare, renewable energies, job training, and humanitarian aid programs.

Personal life and death

Turner married Patricia Busby Whitney (September 25, 1923 – June 12, 2013) on 23 December 1953. The couple had two children, Laurel and Geoffrey. The marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Turner then married Norwegian-born Eli Karin Gilbert () in 1985. On 15 January 2000, Turner survived a plane crash, although seriously injured, in Costa Rica that killed his wife and three other people on board. Turner and his wife were on the L-410 Turbolet operated by Taxi Aereo Centroamericano, on a flight from the small airport of Tobías Bolaños International Airport in San José, destined toward Tortuguero. Three minutes after take-off the airplane crashed into a house. The cause of the crash was unknown. Turner later married Marion Levitt Weiss in 2002.

Turner died at his home in Redmond, Washington on January 18, 2018, at age 94.

Awards and honors
Turner was an Honorary fellow of his University of Oxford alma mater, Exeter College, where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar.

Turner was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor George Ryan in 1999 in the area of Government.

Turner received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1978.

Biography

He was born in Asti in the Piedmont. He became a monk in the abbey of Santa Andrea in Vercelli; then moved to the abbey of San Pietro, Gattinara. In 1707, he was named abbott of Santa Maria Nova of Asti. He initially trained in Vercelli with the monk Danese Rho, a manuscript illuminator. He was master at reproducing miniature copies of the works of the pastel painter Rosalba Carriera and the painter Maria Felice Tibaldi, who married the painter Pierre Subleyras.

In 1717, he was called to Rome, where he was made by Pope Clement XI Albani, as abbot in perpetuity of the Augustinian St John Lateran. In Rome, he was in contact with many of the premier artists of Italy including Trevisani, Balestra, Maratta, Nicolas Vleughels, and Antonio Maria Zanetti. Due his role in the Vatican library and to his proximity to the Pope, Ramelli was able to arrange a commission from Daniel Seiter to engrave in copper plates the famed Byzantine Menologion of Basil II. In 1739, Abbot Ramelli commissioned Subleyras' canvas depicting Christ in the House of Simon for the church of Santa Maria Nuova in Asti. Also in 1739, he helped induct Subleyras into Academy of St Luke, of which he was a member since 1722 as Academic of Merit. Subleyras painted Ramelli's portrait circa 1735.

Ramelli excelled in portrait miniatures. In the Gallery of Bologna, there are miniatures of Guido Reni, Lorenzo Pasinelli, Giovanni Gioseffo Dal Sole; while in Dresden is a female portrait. In the Riksmuseum of Amsterdam, there is a miniature of Joseph and Potiphar by Carlo Cignani. The Palazzo Graziani in Pesaro has a miniature painting of a Shepherd with dead game, while at the University of Padua is a miniature of the Virgin and Child. The King of Sardinia invited Ramelli to his court, where he was for some time employed in painting the portraits of the most celebrated painters, many of which he copied from the originals, painted by themselves, in the Florentine Gallery (now Uffizi).

He died in Rome and was buried in 1941 Santa Maria della Pace.

473,2019782,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold%20Hills,Arnold Hills,"Arnold Frank Hills (12 March 1857 – 7 March 1927) was an English businessman, sportsman, philanthropist, and promoter of vegetarianism.

Biography

Hills was born in Denmark Hill, Surrey, son of a manufacturing chemist.

Arnold Hills was also a keen sportsman who was the English mile (1878) and three-mile champion (1879), and in his youth had played football and cricket (he was Captain of the 1st XI) for his school team Harrow. After leaving Harrow he attended University College, Oxford, where he earned the degree of B.A. (1880) and two football blues. He appeared as a forward for Oxford University as they finished runners-up in the 1877 FA Cup Final against Wanderers.

He continued to play as an amateur for Old Harrovians after he left, even winning a Corinthian's Cap whilst there; for England, against Scotland on 5 April 1879 at the Kennington Oval, when England won 5–4.

In addition to his vegetarian activism, Hills was Managing Director of the Thames Iron Works, a large shipbuilding business in London which had existed since 1846. He chose to live for five years among his workers in a small house in the East India Dock Road in Canning Town and organised recreational centres for them.

However, he caused some bitterness when there was a strike over poor pay and working conditions by employing 'black' labour. Considering his philanthropy, it must have been a situation that troubled him greatly.

In the summer of 1895 Hills, along with Dave Taylor, helped found Thames Ironworks F.C., who later became West Ham United. He believed that his own local community should have its own football team and financially supported the football club until April 1900, when after increasing disagreements with West Ham's board members over the pursuit of 'professionalism', he broke formal ties with the club and the Thames Ironworks.

Hills proposed a West Ham as a limited company and became the major shareholder, and encouraged business associates, family and his workman to invest, promising to buy one share for every one sold to the public. He rented the Memorial Grounds to the club at very favourable terms. Hills told the new directors he would not interfere in the running of the club and was true to his word and despite being by far the largest single shareholder never attended an AGM, ask to address a meeting or present any demands or suggestions.

The failing fortunes of the ironworks and his involvement in developing a new car engine pushed the club into the background and he became a virtual invalid suffering from arthritis. He died at Hammerfield, Penshurst, Kent, in 1927 aged 69, and was buried at St Luke's Church in Penshurst. His shareholding in West Ham of 1100 out of 4000 (1142 shares remained unsold until 1961) passed to his family and the same arrangements remained.

In 2014 as part of their preparation for their move to the Olympic Stadium, West Ham announced one of the corporate entertainment areas would be a private dining club, the Arnold Hills suite.

Vegetarianism

Hills was the first President of the London Vegetarian Society (1888) serving alongside the young Mahatma Gandhi on the Executive Committee. He was also the first President of the Vegetarian Cycling and Athletic Club and also served as President of a London Vegetarian Rambling Club. He founded The Vegetarian, an independent magazine, as well as the Vegetarian Federal Union (1889), of which he was also President. Hills also had close ties with the Temperance League. He founded the Oriolet Fruitarian Hospital at Loughton, under the medical direction of Josiah Oldfield.

Hills authored Vital Food (1892) which argued for a plant-based raw food diet.

Charles W. Forward's 1898 book on vegetarian history, Fifty Years of Food Reform was dedicated to Hills.

474,42952012,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian%20Hospital%20%28New%20York%20City%29,Presbyterian Hospital (New York City),"Presbyterian Hospital was a New York City hospital. It was founded in 1868 and began operations in 1872. It was originally located between East 70th Street and 71st Streets and Madison and Park Avenue. The hospital expanded continuously throughout the late 19th century, adding an outpatient dispensary in 1888, a school of nursing in 1892, and additional beds and services in 1892, 1893, 1904 and 1912.

In 1998, Presbyterian Hospital merged with New York Hospital, creating New York Presbyterian Hospital.

History
Presbyterian Hospital was founded by James Lenox in 1868, and began operations in 1872, in buildings designed by Richard Morris Hunt. During the Spanish–American War, World War I and World War II, the hospital operated military wards or overseas hospital bases.

In 1910, the hospital became affiliated with Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and with other hospitals and institutes in Manhattan, including, in 1925, the Sloane Hospital for Women, an obstetrics and gynecology hospital founded in 1886. It also was affiliated with the Vanderbilt Clinic, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, the Neurological Institute of New York, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Around 1920, Edward Harkness joined the hospital's board and donated the land to complete his vision of a combining a medical school and hospital. In 1925, construction began on the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, the first center of its type in the world, in New York City's Washington Heights neighborhood. The hospital moved to a new James Gamble Rogers-designed facility, which included the Harkness Pavilion for private patients and the Squier Urology Clinic, in 1928. The center, now Columbia University Medical Center, is located between West 165th and 168th Streets, between Broadway and Riverside Drive.

In 1998, Presbyterian Hospital merged with New York Hospital to form New York-Presbyterian Hospital, which has six campuses (five in Manhattan and one in Westchester County).

Architecture

The writer Henry James described the hospital at Madison Avenue and 70th Street in his 1907 book The American Scene as an ""exemplary Hospital"" and expressing his admiration for the red-bricked building's ability to ""invest itself with stillness. It was as if the clamorous city ... [was] forever at rest and no one was stepping lively for miles and miles. [...] I was won over, on the spot.""

The Federal Writer's Project's Guide to New York City, published in 1940, extolled the virtues of the 1928 building, and the other original building of the Medical Center, as ""among the pioneering structures of the late 1920s when traditional styles were being abandoned in favor of a utilitarian approach,"" with large flat windows to provide the maximum amount of natural light. The AIA Guide to New York City, on the other hand, says the flat windows are ""bulky and banal"" and calls the streetscape ""a bore"".

Club career

Pescara
Born in Lucera, Apulia, Inglese started his professional career at Abruzzo club Pescara. At young age, Inglese had played for Pescara under-18 reserve B team at Berretti League in 2006–07 season. The Reserve B team merged with Reserve A team as the Pescara first team was relegated from Serie B in the 2006–07 season, thus the club's reserve team was no longer eligible to compete in the National Youth ""Primavera"" League. Inglese was a member of the youth teams and the reserve side until 2010. Inglese also made 6 league appearances in the Italian third division. Pescara won promotion back to the second division as the winners of the 2009–10 Lega Pro Prima Divisione Group B playoffs.

Inglese made his Serie B debut in the first round of 2010–11 Serie B season.

Chievo
On 28 August 2010, Chievo signed Inglese for €600,000 and Francesco Dettori for €50,000 in co-ownership deal. Co-currently Chievo sold Luca Ariatti to Pescara for €650,000 Thus made the deal a pure swap. On 31 August 2010, Inglese left for Lumezzane in temporary deal, re-joining Chievo teammate Lucas Finazzi. In June 2011 Chievo signed Dettori outright for free and Inglese for €129,000. (That season Chievo paid €29,000 in net to Pescara as the club sold Andrea Mengoni to Pescara in July 2010) In July 2011 the temporary deal was renewed and again on 16 July 2012.

Carpi (loan)
On 2 September 2013, Inglese was signed by Carpi. Inglese scored his first goal for Carpi in the 2–0 victory away to Spezia on 7 September 2013. Inglese made 21 appearances for Carpi as they went on to finish 12th in Serie B.

Carpi (second loan)
In July 2014, Inglese once again re-joined Carpi on loan, until 30 June 2015. Inglese scored his first goals of his second loan spell on 15 November 2014, a brace in a 5–2 win against Cittadella. Inglese followed up his goals against Cittadella with two late goals against Brescia seven days later to earn, nine man Carpi, a 3–3 draw.

Return to Chievo
After two years on loan at Carpi, Inglese returned to Chievo and made his first appearance for the club as well as his Serie A debut on 20 September 2015 in the 0–1 home defeat to Internazionale. He opened his scoring account later on 2 November where he scored his team's only goal in the 1–1 draw against Sampdoria, which was followed by two goals in the next two matches, the first against his former side Carpi and the second against Udinese, striking from 25 metres in an eventual 2–3 home loss. He finished the 2015–16 season by making 26 league appearances, scoring three times in the process, as Chievo finished Serie A in a comfortable 9th place.

On 13 May 2016, Inglese agreed a contract extension that would keep him at Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi until 30 June 2020. Later on 29 November, he scored a brace in Chievo's 3–0 home defeat of Novara in the fourth round of 2016–17 Coppa Italia.

He kicked off 2017 by playing in the 1–0 away defeat to Fiorentina, and scored his first goal on 28 January, a last-minute winner against Lazio. On 12 February 2017, Inglese scored his first Serie A hat-trick in Chievo's 3–1 away win over Sassuolo, also missing a penalty during the same match, becoming only the fourth player in Chievo's history to reach this feat. On 22 October 2017, Inglese scored two goals in a 3–2 victory over fierce rivals Hellas Verona in the Verona derby.

Parma
Despite being acquired by Napoli in 2017, Inglese never played for gli Azzurri and, on 16 July 2019, he returned at Parma on loan with an obligation to buy after the 2018–19 season.

International career
He was called up to the senior Italy squad for World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Albania in October 2017.

480,5216394,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta%20Hillers,Marta Hillers,"Marta Hillers (May 26, 1911 – June 16, 2001) was a German journalist, and the author of the memoir Eine Frau in Berlin (A Woman in Berlin), published anonymously in 1959 and 2003 in German. It is the diary of a German woman from 20 April to 22 June 1945, during and after the Battle of Berlin. The book details the author's rape, in the context of mass rape by the occupying forces, and how she and many other German women chose to take a Soviet officer as a protector.

The book was first published in English in 1954 in the United States. When it was published in Germany in 1959, the author was accused of ""besmirching the honor of German women."" Hillers refused to have another edition published in her lifetime. Having married and moved to Switzerland, Hillers left journalism and did not publish another major work. She died in 2001.

A new edition of her book was published posthumously in Germany in 2003, again anonymously. It met wide critical acclaim and was on the bestseller list for weeks. A controversy broke out when a literary editor revealed the author as Hillers. No one else has been suggested. New English editions were published in the United Kingdom and the United States in 2005, as well as in seven other languages. The book was adapted as a film and released first in 2008 in Germany and Poland. In the United States it is known as A Woman in Berlin.

Early life and education
Marta Hillers was born in Krefeld, Germany, on May 26, 1911. After attending local schools, she studied in Paris at the Sorbonne. She later travelled extensively throughout Europe, including the Soviet Union. She spoke French and some Russian in addition to her native German.

Career
Hillers worked as a journalist in Berlin, writing for magazines and newspapers. She also did some minor work for the Nazi regime but is not believed to have been a Party member.

In 1945 she was in Berlin when the Soviets captured it. During this period, she kept a diary, describing how the women, children, and elderly men survived in the city in those days. In her diary entry of the 11 May 1945 she made an inventory:
On the one hand things are good for me. I’m fresh and healthy. I have not suffered any physical harm. I have the feeling that I’m excellently equipped for life, as if I had webbed feet for the mud. I am adapted to the world. I’m not delicate…On the other side there are only minuses. I no longer know what I’m supposed to do in the world. I’m indispensable to no one. I’m just standing around, waiting. I can see neither goal nor task before me.   

In later entries she describes that she and other women of any age were repeatedly raped by Red Army soldiers. To protect themselves, she and other women took Soviet soldiers as protectors; she chose the highest-ranking man she could find, and described this as ""sleeping for food."" An estimated 100,000 women in Berlin were raped during the occupation. She stopped writing the diary at the end of June following the return of her fiancé Gerd from the war.

Following the war and encouraged by a friend, she had her memoir published in English in the United States in 1954. She kept her identity anonymous. Hillers married in the 1950s and moved to Basel, Switzerland. In 1959, she had her memoir published in German in Switzerland, again anonymously. Based on the negative reviews it received in Germany and accusations about her having offended the honor of German women, she refused to have any new editions published in her lifetime. She died on June 16, 2001, in Basle. A Woman in Berlin was her only major work.

A Woman in Berlin

With the aid of German author Kurt Marek, Hillers published her book in the United States in 1954. Marek agreed to her wish to be anonymous and arranged for a translation into English. In 1955 the book was published in the United Kingdom by Secker and Warburg.

In 1959 Hillers published her memoir in German, by a Swiss publisher, Kossodo, and again insisted on anonymity. The book received hostile reviews in Germany and did not sell well. Hillers (whose name was not revealed at this time) was accused of ""besmirching the honour of German women"", of ""shameless immorality"" and of anti-communist propaganda. One review accused her of falsifying her account and of doing a ""disservice to Berlin women.""

Hans Magnus Enzensberger, who published the 2003 German edition, wrote about the book's reception in the postwar years:  
""German readers were obviously not ready to face some uncomfortable truths... German women were not supposed to talk about the reality of rapes; and German men preferred not to be seen as impotent onlookers when the victorious Russians claimed their spoils of war. The author's attitude was an aggravating factor: devoid of self-pity, with a clear-eyed view of her compatriots' behaviour before and after the Nazi regime's collapse, everything she wrote flew in the face of the reigning post-war complacency and amnesia.""

After this controversy, Hillers refused to allow the book to be republished in her lifetime. It circulated in Germany in photocopied form and was popular among German feminists in the 1970s. Hans Magnus Enzensberger, a poet and essayist, had learned that Hannelore Marek held the copyright and had agreed to Hillers' prohibition against publication in her lifetime. She contacted him when the former journalist died.

Enzensberger, a poet and essayist, arranged publication of a new edition of Eine Frau in Berlin as part of his Die Andere Bibliothek series. In 2005, the memoir was republished in a new English translation, by Virago Press, a feminist publishing house in London and in the United States by Macmillan. It became a best seller in both German and English editions.

Journalists quickly investigated in 2003 to determine the identity of the author. Jens Bisky, the literary editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, wrote in September 2003 that Hillers may have been the anonymous author. He wrote a profile of her life, noting that she was a journalist who worked on magazines and newspapers during the Nazi era and had done some minor work for the Nazi government. He thought she was likely not a member of the Nazi Party. Hannelore Marek, who holds the copyright, did not confirm that Hillers was the author of A Woman in Berlin. Enzensberger denounced Bisky's comments as ""Skandal-journalismus"". No other candidate for the authorship of the book has been suggested.

Marek had noted in his afterword to the 1954 English edition that the book was based on a typescript drawn from handwritten notes. His widow, Hannelore Marek, kept these after his death in 1971. At the time of the Bisky revelations in 2003, Christian Esch, writing in the Berliner Zeitung, noted differences between the editions and the Marek-held notes. He said that if the diary were to be accepted as a fully authentic work, the originals would have to be examined by experts.

Subsequently, an examination of the notes was done by Walter Kempowski on behalf of the publishing house. He concluded that it was a genuine diary of the war period. He noted the typescript and the published book contain material not in the diary, but this is not unusual as books are prepared for publication. Antony Beevor a British historian who wrote a ""magisterial book"" on the Battle of Berlin, confirmed his belief in the book's authenticity. He said it conformed to his own detailed knowledge of the period and the other primary sources he has accumulated. The book has been published in seven languages in addition to English and German.

The book was adapted as a German feature film. Max Färberböck directed Anonyma - Eine Frau in Berlin (2008), starring Nina Hoss as the Woman; it was first released in Germany and Poland. The film was released in the United States as A Woman in Berlin (2009).

History

Road circuit
Motor racing on Phillip Island began in 1928 with the running of the 100 Miles Road Race, an event which has since become known as the first Australian Grand Prix. It utilised a high speed rectangle of local closed-off public roads with four similar right hand corners. The course length varied, with the car course approximately  per lap, compared to the motorcycle circuit which was approximately  in length. The circuit was the venue for the Australian Grand Prix through to 1935 and it was used for the last time on 6 May 1935 for the Jubilee Day Races.

A new  triangular circuit utilising the pit straight from the original rectangular course was subsequently mapped out and first used for the Australian Race Drivers' Cup on 5 November 1935. The final car event on the circuit was held on Cup Day (1 November) 1938 and the final motorcycle race meeting was conducted on 30 January 1940.

Significant events staged at the Phillip Island road circuit included:
 1928 100 Miles Road Race

Grand Prix circuit

1956–1962
In 1951, a group of six local businessmen decided to build a new track. About  away from the original circuit, it still bears the corner name signs of the original circuit. As the piece of available land was on the edge of the coast, the track is known for its steep grades – the highest 57 metres – which caused cost overruns and delays in track opening. The new track was opened in 1956 and in 1960 the first Armstrong 500 production car race was held at the circuit. Extensive damage resulted from the running of the 1962 Armstrong 500, and, with the circuit owners unable to finance repairs, the circuit was closed and the race was moved to the Mount Panorama Circuit at Bathurst in New South Wales, to eventually become known as the Bathurst 1000.

1967–1978
The circuit reopened in October 1967 and hosted the Phillip Island 500K endurance race, a round of the Australian Manufacturers' Championship, from 1971 to 1977. The race was also a round of the Australian Touring Car Championship in 1976 and 1977. But again, due to its testing terrain, the circuit required significant maintenance and slowly declined through the 1970s. It was farmed by its owners while closed and was then sold in 1985 in preparation for reopening, but did not do so until 1988 after agreement on a long-term lease and rebuild agreement. During the time the circuit deteriorated and finally closed, part of the main problem for its owners was that the main bridge from the island to the Australian mainland reportedly could not carry the heavy vehicles needed to resurface the circuit. This meant that the bitumen surface was a cold mix which easily broke up under the rigours of racing, instead of the standard hot mix which would have allowed a more durable surface. It would not be until the mid-1980s that the bridge would be rebuilt allowing the necessary equipment needed for resurfacing.

1988–present
The circuit was refurbished with a reduced length of  and was reopened on 4 December 1988 for the final round of the 1988 Swann Insurance International Series for motorcycles.

In 1989, the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix joined the FIM Road Racing World Championship calendar for the first time, and was held at Phillip Island. The 1989 race saw a race long dice in the 500 cc division between local favourites Wayne Gardner and Kevin Magee, along with Wayne Rainey and Christian Sarron. The race was won by 1987 World Champion Gardner to the delight of the huge crowd. Gardner would make it two in a row at the Island in 1990 before the race moved to Eastern Creek in Sydney for 1991. The Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix would remain at Eastern Creek until it returned permanently to Phillip Island from 1997 onwards.

Phillip Island hosted its first Superbike World Championship round in 1990, taking over from Sydney's Oran Park Raceway as the Australian round of the series. Local riders Peter Goddard (Yamaha FZR750) and Rob Phillis (Kawasaki ZXR750) won the two races for what was Round 12 of the season, with Goddard having secured pole position. The World Superbike round continues to be held annually at Phillip Island to this day.

In 1990, the Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) returned to the circuit for the first time since 1977, this time as a sprint round. Dick Johnson won the round in his Ford Sierra RS500, in what was to be his final ever round victory. The event was not held in 1991 or 1992, but was reinstated to the calendar in 1993, with the sprint format then continuing every year until 2004. By then, the ATCC was known as V8 Supercars. After not appearing on the calendar in 2004, from 2005 to 2007, Phillip Island hosted the Grand Finale; the final round of the V8 Supercars season. In each year, the event decided that year's champion, including in controversial circumstances in 2006. From 2008 to 2011, Phillip Island returned to hosting a 500 km race, this time known for sponsorship reasons as the L&H 500. The Phillip Island 500 replaced Sandown's Sandown 500 as the annual V8 Supercar 500 km race, an event which was later reinstated for 2012. Since then, Phillip Island has returned to hosting a sprint round of the championship, which has become known as the Phillip Island Super Sprint.

The Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix has always been more of a promoter event than a profit-raiser in itself. The contract was prolonged until 2026, although tobacco advertising has been banned since 2007.

 2012: Australian Casey Stoner wins his sixth consecutive Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix, as well as his last career Grand Prix victory. Before the race, the third corner of the circuit is named after Stoner. 
 2014: Jamie Whincup becomes the first ever driver to win a sixth ATCC/V8 Supercars title by winning the second Saturday race at the Plus Fitness Phillip Island 400.

Lap records

In the early 1990s, Phillip Island was used during the Australian summer for pre-season testing by various World Sportscar Championship teams and some Japanese Formula 3000 teams (who generally found travelling to Australia was actually cheaper than paying some $5,000 per hour to hire the Honda owned Suzuka Circuit in Japan). While no official lap times were published, television commentator and race driver Neil Crompton reported in 1990 that the Nissan Motorsports International team with drivers Julian Bailey and Mark Blundell driving the Nissan R90C were able to lap the circuit in around 1:18 while a 3.0 Litre Mugen V8 powered Dome F3000 (which Crompton drove) was able record similar lap times. At the time the fastest Australian cars that raced at Phillip Island were the 3.8 Litre V6 powered Formula Holdens which were approximately 10 seconds per lap slower.

In late October 2018 Mathew Radisich drove his 2011 ex-Conquest Racing IndyCar during testing at Phillip Island as a part of unofficial practice day, with images distributed online of his recorded Cosworth data showing a lap time of 1:17.005. However, as this time was not set during a race meeting, it does not count as an official lap record.

489,12521687,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania%20Route%20244,Pennsylvania Route 244,"Pennsylvania Route 244 (PA 244) is a  state highway located in Potter County, Pennsylvania.  The western terminus is at PA 44 in Coneville.  The eastern terminus is the New York state line in Genesee Township. The route passes through rural areas, intersecting PA 449 in Genesee. The route was paved in 1931 and designated by 1941 between PA 44 and PA 449. PA 244 was extended to the New York state line in 1982. In 2011, the Genesee River bridge was replaced, eliminating a detour that had been in place since 2003.

Route description

PA 244 begins at an intersection with PA 44 in the community of Coneville in Hebron Township, heading east-northeast on a two-lane undivided road. The road runs through a narrow valley with some agriculture and homes, entering the borough of Oswayo. At this point, the route becomes Main Street and passes a few homes before crossing into Oswayo Township. PA 244 heads east on Rose Lake Road through hilly forested areas, turning southeast and briefly entering Genesee Township before continuing into Allegany Township. The route heads east into agricultural areas and turns north onto Andrews Settlement Road in the community of Andrews Settlement.

The road heads back into Genesee Township and passes through a mix of farms and woods as it passes through Ellisburg. Farther north, PA 244 continues through a narrow agricultural valley with a few homes as Ellisburg Road, running through Chapmans. The route turns northeast through forests and reaches an intersection with PA 449 in the community of Genesee. PA 244 continues east as School Street and crosses the Genesee River on a bridge. The route turns to the north at SR 1010, continuing to the New York border. At the border, PA 244 ends and the road becomes NY 248A.

History

Most of PA 244's route was paved in 1931 and was signed by 1941. Originally, PA 244 ended at PA 449 in Genesee, but by 1982 it was extended east across the Genesee River to the New York state line. In 2003, the School Street Bridge carrying PA 244 across the Genesee River was closed due to its age and deteriorating conditions. This closure forced PA 244 to share a short concurrency with PA 449 and SR 1010 in Genesee. In 2011, a new bridge opened returning PA 244 to its original alignment.

495,68856709,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday%20reading%20periodical,Sunday reading periodical,"Sunday reading was a genre of periodical popular in Victorian Britain which offered light Christian reading thought to be suitable for families to read at home on Sundays. Typical examples such as Sunday at Home, The Quiver, and Leisure Hour featured a mixture of fiction, non-fiction, and verse, all dealing in some way with Christian themes.

The genre was partly a reaction to the rise of cheaply available secular publications which some observers considered to be morally insidious. It declined around the beginning of the 20th century as social taboos around consuming secular entertainment on the Sabbath weakened.

Content
Sunday reading magazines contained a mixture of fiction, non-fiction, and verse, though contributions generally all featured an overtly Christian perspective. Fiction, which included short stories and serialized novels such as Jessica's First Prayer (serialised in 1866 in Sunday at Home), typically carried clear moral lessons. Editors justified the inclusion of fiction by comparison with the parables of Jesus. Toward the end of the 19th century, publications became increasingly willing to feature sensational secular fiction. For example, by the 1890s, The Quiver was publishing stories by authors like Baroness Orczy and H. Rider Haggard.

Audience
Rather than aiming to proselytize to the masses, Sunday periodicals were largely intended to provide suitable Sunday entertainment for families which were already devoutly Christian. Victorian society was known for its sobre attitude toward the Sabbath. For example, the illustrator Ernest Shepard recalled that as a child he and his brother were prevented from playing with toys, and that their reading options were limited to religious Sunday periodicals: ""No old Punch or Illustrated London News volumes to look at: instead The Sunday Magazine, Leisure Hour, and Sunday at Home...""

Sunday reading periodicals competed with, and were partly a reaction to, a variety of inexpensive secular periodicals which began to appear in the 1840s, such as The London Journal, The Family Herald, Lloyd's Weekly, and Reynold's Miscellany. These were typically priced at a single penny, leading to the epithet ""penny weeklies"".

An 1859 issue of the London Review reported on a survey of periodicals stocked by London coffee-houses undertaken by the Pure Literature Society. They found 171 houses which stocked The Leisure Hour and 34 which stocked Sunday at Home, both being Sunday reading magazines approved by the Society. They also found that 259 houses kept periodicals which the Society deemed ""objectionable"", such as The London Journal and The Family Herald.

The market for Sunday periodicals declined around the beginning of the 20th century as it became more socially acceptable to partake in secular entertainment on the Sabbath. In 1899, the annual report of the Religious Tract Society, which published multiple Sunday periodicals, stated that their publications ""have to fight more or less for very life"", and that ""every year makes their way more difficult"".

It was created on 15 July 1902 for the Liberal politician Sir Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth, 2nd Baronet. Both his sons were killed in the First World War and he was therefore succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron (eldest son of Hon. Lawrence Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth, eldest son of the first Baron). However, both he and his brother, the third Baron, were killed in action during the Second World War. On the death of the third Baron in 1942 the titles passed to his first cousin, the fourth Baron (eldest son of the Hon. Edward Kay-Shuttleworth, second son of the first Baron), who survived the Second World War although he was badly wounded.  the titles are held by the latter's son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 1975. He has been Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire since 1997.

The Kay-Shuttleworth Baronetcy, of Gawthorpe in the County Palatine of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1849 for the first Baronet, the physician, social reformer and educationalist James Kay-Shuttleworth. Born James Kay, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Shuttleworth on his marriage in 1842 to Janet Shuttleworth, only child and heiress of Robert Shuttleworth of Gawthorpe Hall.

Two of the first Baronet's brothers also gained distinction. Joseph Kay was a noted economist while Sir Edward Kay was a Lord Justice of Appeal.

The family seat was Gawthorpe Hall at Padiham near Burnley, Lancashire. The house was sold by the family in 1970. It is now financed and run by the National Trust in partnership with Lancashire County Council. The present Baron lives at Leck Hall near Kirkby Lonsdale in north Lancashire.
