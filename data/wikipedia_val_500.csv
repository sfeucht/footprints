He is currently an assistant coach with the Port Adelaide Football Club.

Career
Bassett made his SANFL debut for Norwood in 1994, he finished sixth in the club best and fairest as a 19-year-old and was drafted at pick 3 by Melbourne Football Club in the inaugural AFL rookie draft.

Melbourne 
Drafted with the third selection in the first AFL Rookie Draft by  in 1997, Bassett was elevated to the senior list after Round 4 in 1997 to replace Craig Turley but suffered a fractured sternum in the next Reserves game and was unable to make his AFL debut for the Demons. When he made his return to the reserves he played six more games at full forward but didn't see much of the ball and wasn't suited to the role. At the end of the season he was traded to Adelaide for Matthew Collins and Brent Williams.

Adelaide 
Bassett impressed in the pre season and made his debut at 21 for the Crows in round 1 1998, showing promise in defence. He was hardly beaten in his debut season, finishing tenth in the Best and Fairest despite only playing 13 games and missing out on finals.

He played 210 games for Adelaide and topped off a great 2005 season by being named Best Team Man and coming runner up in the club's Best and Fairest award.

In 2006 Bassett was named to the All-Australian Team, along with his teammates Andrew McLeod and Simon Goodwin.

Some of Bassett's nicknames include The Hound, Bassy, Bruce and Fred Basset – after the comic strip which appears in many Australian newspapers.

He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1997.

6,63644446,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89vanturel%20Lake,Évanturel Lake,"Évanturel Lake (French: Lac Évanturel) is a freshwater body located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Pikauba, in the Charlevoix Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. This body of water is located in the zec des Martres, outside the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.

Lake Évanturel is one of the main bodies of water at the head of the Barley River. This mountain lake is entirely located in an area where forestry has always been the predominant economic activity. In the middle of XIXth, recreational tourism activities took off. Due to the altitude, this lake is normally frozen from late October to early May; however, the safe ice circulation period is usually from early December to April.

A forest road serves the western part of the hydrographic slope of Lake Évanturel and another road the eastern part.

Geography 
Located in a forest area in the unorganized territory of Lac-Pikauba in the zec des Martres, Lake Évanturel (length: ; altitude: ) is located on the northern slope of the Barley River valley. The mouth of Lake Évanturel is located at the bottom of a bay on the south shore of the lake, at:
  north of the forest road R0305;
  south-west of a bay in lac des Martres;
  west of La Malbaie town center;
  north-west of Baie-Saint-Paul town center.

From the mouth of Lake Évanturel, the current descends on  towards the south the outlet of Lake Évanturel, then follows the course of the Barley River on  generally towards the west, then follows the course of the Malbaie river on  with a drop of  which flows into La Malbaie in the Saint Lawrence River.

Toponymy 
This name appears on the 1954 map of the Parc des Laurentides and on Regional Map No 3, sheet 3 East, 3 miles per inch, 1957. This name also appeared on the draft map of Lac des Martres, 1961-09-25, item 62.

The term ""Évanturel"" is a family name of French origin. It is not unreasonable to believe that this toponym evokes the work of life of the Quebec poet Eudore Évanturel (Quebec, September 22, 1852 - Boston, May 16, 1919). Encouraged by the novelist Joseph Marmette, his friend, he published in 1878 a volume of First Poems. This collection, inspired by Musset but with Verlainian accents, scandalized the conservative literary milieu of Quebec at the time. The ruthless and unfair criticisms of Jules-Paul Tardivel in particular dissuaded him from going further in the career. The author subsequently published only a few isolated poems. His work is still little known, but it is nonetheless among the most sensitive, original and inspired poets of Quebec before Nelligan. He is buried in the Notre-Dame-de-Belmont cemetery in Sainte-Foy. This toponymic designation was approved on 1963-07-03 by the Commission de géographie du Québec. Formerly, this body of water was designated ""Lac de l'Équerre"".

The toponym ""Lac Évanturel"" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

8,1774475,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool%20Illuminations,Blackpool Illuminations,"Blackpool Illuminations is an annual lights festival, founded in 1879 and first switched on 18 September that year, held each autumn in the British seaside resort of Blackpool on the Fylde Coast in Lancashire.
Also known locally as The Lights or The Illuminations, they run each year for 66 days, from late August until early November at a time when most other English seaside resorts' seasons are coming to an end. They are  long and use over one million bulbs. The display stretches along the Promenade from Starr Gate at the south end of the town to Bispham in the north.

History
The Illuminations were first shown in 1879 when they were described as 'Artificial sunshine', and consisted of just eight carbon arc lamps which bathed the Promenade. The original event preceded Thomas Edison's patent of the electric light bulb by twelve months. The first display similar to the modern-day displays was held in May 1912 to mark the first British Royal family visit to Blackpool when Princess Louise opened a new section of the Promenade, Princess Parade. The Promenade was decorated with what was described as ""festoons of garland lamps"" using about 10,000 light bulbs. The local Chamber of trade as well as other local businesses requested Blackpool Council to stage the event in September of the same year. The subsequent event was such a success that in 1913 the council were again asked to stage the Princess Parade lights as an end of season event. With the outbreak of the First World War there were no further displays until 1925 when the lights were again on display and extended to run from Manchester Square to Cocker Square. In 1932 animated tableaux were erected running along the cliffs from North Shore to Bispham, and the Illuminations were extended to its current length running from Starr Gate to Red Bank Road at Bispham.

In 1935 the Mayor of Blackpool, Alderman George Whittaker was due to perform the Switch-on ceremony. When he met Railway Queen Audrey Mosson, 15, he was so impressed by her, he asked her to take his place. 50 years later, in 1985, Audrey was invited back to perform the ceremony alongside actress Joanna Lumley.

The Illuminations were ready to shine in 1939 but the outbreak of the Second World War again interrupted the annual display and post war austerity meant the lights were not switched on again until 1949.

Every year there is also the Festival of Light which features interactive installations and is described as being ""a contemporary look at the concept of light and art working together to create entertainment"".

Switch On

Each year the opening night of the Illuminations, The Big Switch On, held in a specially erected arena with a celebrity pulling a switch to turn on the six miles of lights. The first switch on ceremony was held in 1934 when Lord Derby flicked the switch to turn on the Illuminations. In 1993 BBC Radio 1 first broadcast the switch on ceremony live when Status Quo were the guest celebrities, before in 1997 BBC Radio 2 started to cover it which continued until 2010, when GMG Radio, under its Real Radio and Smooth Radio brands took over the broadcasting of the switch on. Each year one main celebrity pulls the switch while there are performances in the Radio 2 arena with a pre-switch on concert featuring pop bands, singers and comedians.

Modern-day Illuminations
Most visitors drive through the Illuminations by car, coach or bus. There are also open top trams which run along the tramway as well as horse-drawn landau. At Bispham there is a special walkway for the tableaux which also includes mixed media in the various large tableaux displays. The Illuminations cost £1.9M each year to stage.

For the 2007 Illuminations, Interior designer and television personality Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen best known for his appearances on the BBC television programme, Changing Rooms was commissioned to create special feature on Central Promenade outside Blackpool Tower, named Decodance. Llewelyn-Bowen had stated that he fell in love with what he called ""Blackpool's high-kicking glamour and historical reputation for giddy glitz"" while filming for the Holiday programme.

The displays at the cliffs from North Shore to Bispham contain forty large tableaux holding more than 5,000 square metres in surface area. There is a pedestrian walkway running the length of the tableaux displays which are set back from the Promenade beyond the tramway. Blackpool Tramway runs along the entire length of the Illuminations and there are over one million lamps in the display. In 2007 the Egyptian tableau which includes Egyptian sarcophagus, which eerily opens to reveal a mummified secret, returned after an overhaul. Also at Bispham on the clifftop was a new BBC Portal video screen.

Also in 2007 a new Doctor Who display appeared with monsters from the last three series of the show. In January 2008, it was stated that this section had been the most successful feature ever built in the Illuminations. And at Gynn Square on Gynn Island, a Space Invasion with an opalescent mothership hovering more than 40 ft in the air, battling it out with eight spaceships arranged in formation defending their territory. The display which used colour-changing LEDs, was created from the popular alien craft which used to adorn the Promenade.

In October 2007, a laser beam installed on the tower for the duration of the annual Illuminations was criticised by astronomer and presenter of The Sky at Night television programme, Patrick Moore who said, ""Light pollution is a huge problem. I am not saying we should turn all the lights out, that is not practical, but there are some things which are very unnecessary. The Blackpool Tower light is certainly something I do not think we should be doing. I very much oppose it."" The beam could be seen 30 miles away. Moore called for the beam to be stopped. The Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said the laser has added to a ""spiralling problem"" affecting astronomy, as astronomical research is increasing carried out at sites outside Europe due to light pollution.

At the sixth annual Banquet and Ball on 9 January 2008, organised by the holiday trade umbrella group, Blackpool Combined Association, to raise funds for the Lights, the new Head of Illuminations, Michael Wilcock revealed new plans for the future of the Illuminations. These include,

 Plans to make the Lights, which at present are funded 80% by Blackpool Council, as self-sustaining as possible, with plans to increase business sponsorship.
 New, all year round, triumphal arches to be erected at either end of the Illuminations, ""selling the Blackpool message.""
 Extending the Doctor Who section for the 2008 season, ""with eye-catching battles between Daleks and the TARDIS.""
 Increased promotion for the 2008 Illuminations season.
 Establishment of a Friends of the Illuminations group.

Blackpool Festival of Lights
Each year in conjunction with the Illuminations the Blackpool Festival of Light, a fusion of art and light events and installations, is staged. In 2007 the Festival started on 31 August with various lighting displays throughout the town with displays by artists and also Blackpool and The Fylde College. These included a mixed media display entitled ""Donkey Fest"" on the cliffs at North Shore, ""Water is Everywhere"" by Creatmosphere at the Water Tower in North Shore which was
an architectural light projection depicting moving water reflections, animating and highlighting the Water Tower building. Also, ""Hypodoché"" by artist Ann Carragher, an expression of the artists personal relationship between life, natural processes, and the female 'space & voice' of architecture throughout the ages. The light installation consisted of water and light was exhibited at a town centre art gallery. Also there was the United Kingdom's first Illuminated Art Car Parade on 21 October as well as the return of the Honda Goldwing Light Parade.

Illuminated cars

There are a variety of rebuilt single deck cars, of different designs, all of which were rebuilt as illuminated theme trams. These run along the illuminated part of the Promenade during the Illuminations. A campaign by the local newspaper, the Blackpool Gazette in 2006 to get one of the Illuminated trams, Western Train, back on track, resulted in a £278,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to restore the tramcar which first ran in 1962. It was withdrawn from service in 1999 and had stood derelict at the Rigby Road depot. The tramcar is due to return during the Illuminations Switch-On in 2008. In January 2008 it was revealed that another iconic illuminated tram, the Rocket tram, which had been in service between 1961 and 1999 but which had since then stood idle, is also due to be restored with expectation being that it would return to service for the Illuminations in 2009 at a cost of about £150,000 and with the help of the Friends of the Illuminations group.

Construction and energy
It takes twenty two weeks for all the lights to be erected in time for the Switch on each year and nine weeks to dismantle them after the display has finished. Most of the display is now operated on low voltage (12 V and 24 V) and in 2003 the Illuminations cut electricity consumption by 11% using new technology. Then in 2004 wind turbines at the Solarium on New South Promenade contributed to powering the Illuminations for the first time.
The Illuminations now only use green electricity from renewable resources, comprising wind power, small-scale hydropower and Biogas. The aim was for the display to be carbon neutral by 2010.

Friends of the Illuminations
In January 2008 Blackpool Council announced plans to start a Friends of the Illuminations stating that they saw the future of the Illuminations as being more interactive, and that ""the group would help us shape the future of one of the country's best, free attractions."" and would also encourage worldwide support.

Blackpool Christmas Lights
Separate from the Illuminations, as part of the Festival of Light, Blackpool Christmas Lights are switched on every year in November in a very similar fashion to the Illuminations. They are located on various streets leading out of The Promenade. On Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve, the Illuminations are switched on non-commercially to accompany the Christmas Lights.

11,29509239,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snip%20Nua,Snip Nua,"Snip Nua was a racing greyhound who featured in the BBC television show Three Men go to Ireland.

Biography
Born in the spring of 2008, Snip Nua  was a racing greyhound who became famous because she featured in the BBC television show Three Men go to Ireland, which was broadcast over the Christmas holidays in December 2009. The show was eagerly anticipated in Ireland as it promised to provide good publicity for both Greyhound racing and Irish tourism, and was even referenced on the Irish tourist board website. 

Due to its inclusion in the television programme, Snip Nua's performance at Mullingar Greyhound stadium in the Three Men Go to Ireland race was watched by an estimated 5-7 million people in the UK alone.

Fior Gael syndicate
Snip Nua was owned by a 16-member syndicate, Fior Gael. In Ireland, syndication is a popular way of spreading the cost and responsibility of greyhound ownership. The Fior Gael syndicate was made up of a group of professionals and business people, among them barristers, lawyers, and journalists. Notable members of the syndicate included Frank McNally, business editor of The Irish Times, and comedian Dara Ó Briain. Ó Briain once described his membership of the syndicate as his worst financial investment. 

He claimed that despite owning six dogs in seven years the syndicate had only had one win. At the time of the Three Men show, Snip Nua was the syndicate's latest dog.  She appeared to be a promising racer who might break the syndicate's poor run of success, and in her first races, the young dog indeed put in some strong performances

Death and legacy
Snip Nua's career as a professional racer was short; on 14 December 2009 she was euthanized after sustaining a hock injury at Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium. 

In early 2010 a series of demonstrations were held at Dara Ó Briain's UK show to try to persuade both him and the BBC to publicly denounce the sport of greyhound racing due to the dog's death.

12,5352021,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapana%20venosa,Rapana venosa,"Rapana venosa, common name the veined rapa whelk or Asian rapa whelk, is a species of large predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc or whelk, in the family Muricidae, the rock shells.

This large sea snail has become an invasive species in many different localities around the world.

Shell description 

The shell of Rapana venosa is globose (rounded) and heavy, possessing a very short spire, a large body whorl, a strong columella and a deep umbilicus. The aperture is large and roughly ovate. Ornamentation is present externally as axial ribs, smooth spiral ribs ending in blunt knobs at both the shoulder and body whorl, and internally as small elongated teeth disposed along the outer lip margin. The external color varies from gray to reddish-brown, with dark brown dashes on the spiral ribs. Some specimens may have distinctive black/dark blue vein-like coloration patterns throughout the inner portions of the shell, usually originating from each individual tooth at the outer lip.
A diagnostic feature for this species is the deep orange color found in the aperture and on the columella. The height of the shell can reach up to 180  mm (about 7 in).

Distribution 
This species is native to the marine and estuarine waters of the western Pacific, from the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, East China Sea and the Bohai Sea.

Rapana venosa is included in Russia's Red Book as threatened with extinction. The original known habitat for this species was the Far East, but since 1947 it has been found in the Black Sea, and its shell became a popular souvenir in Crimea. Recently this species has  been found as an exotic in the Chesapeake Bay, on the eastern coast of the United States.

Nonindigenous distribution 
According to some authors, it appears to be the case that the spreading of this species outside its natural range has been made possible by the planktonic larval stage being transported along with ballast water in the hulls of ships, or that egg masses may have been transported with  products of marine farming.

Rapa whelks were first found in the Black Sea in the 1940s.  Within a decade this mollusk had spread along the Caucasian and Crimean coasts and moved into the Sea of Azov. From 1959 to 1972, its range extended into the northwest Black Sea, to the coastlines of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. These whelks have become established in the Adriatic and Aegean seas, and have also been found in the Tyrrhenian sea, on the Northern Atlantic coast of France, and the southeast coast of South America, in Uruguay and the Rio de La Plata estuary (including Samborombon Bay), and in Argentina. In the United States the first specimen discovered was in August 1998 by members of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) Trawl Survey Group in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The species is now widely distributed and established in Chesapeake Bay.

Rapana venosa is considered among the 100 worst alien species in Europe in the DAISIE European Invasive Alien Species Gateway, one of two marine gastropods on the list. It is considered as about the 52nd the worst alien species in Europe.

Ecology

Habitat 
Veined rapa whelks favor compact sandy bottoms, in which they can burrow almost completely. The native habitat of this species is a region of wide annual temperature ranges, comparable to other localities. Fleeing cold waters in the winter, this species may migrate to warmer, deeper waters, thereby evading cool surface waters. This fertile sea snail is extremely versatile, tolerating low salinities, water pollution and oxygen deficient waters.

Feeding habits 
Veined rapa whelks are carnivorous selective predatory gastropods whose main diet consists of a variety of other mollusk species, mainly epifaunal bivalves such as oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Modiolus and Geukensia), but also clams (Anadara inaequivalvis, Chamelea gallina, Tapes philippinarum, Venus verrucosa, and the northern quahog Mercenaria mercenaria). Prey are chosen by the whelk according to their species and size. Most snails feed by drilling a hole into their bivalve prey, but rapa whelks usually smother their prey by wrapping around the hinged region of the shell and feed by introducing their proboscis between the opened valves. The whelk can also secrete a thick mucus that may or may not contain biotoxins to weaken the prey. Shell drilling, however, is also not unknown in this species.

Life cycle 

Rapana venosa is dioecious, which means  each individual organism belonging to this species is distinctly male or female. In this species' native range, mating occurs for extended periods of time, mainly during the winter and spring. It reproduces by internal fertilization, after which it lays clusters of egg cases that resemble small mats of white to yellow shag carpet, mainly during spring and summer. One adult female can lay multiple egg cases throughout the season. Each cluster contains 50-500 egg cases, and each egg case may contain 200-1000 eggs. The pelagic veliger larvae (a larval form common to various marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) then hatch, persisting in the water column for 14 to 80 days and feeding primarily on plankton. They eventually settle on the ocean floor where they develop into hard-shelled snails. Growth is rapid over the first year of life, and reproduction occurs from the second year onwards. Large specimens may be over ten years old.

Reasons for the survival of this invasive species 
It is known that the abundance of prey, the lack of competition from other gastropod species, as well as the absence of direct predators of R. venosa may be some of the factors that contributed to the successful establishment of new populations of this sea snail outside its native range.  The thick strong shell of the rapa whelk is arguably its strongest advantage over native whelks, because rapas can easily prey on local whelks, whereas local whelks are unable to successfully attack rapas. The thick shell also means that predators such as sea turtles are unable to feed on the invasive species, and can only feed on local whelk populations.  It is suggested that once the rapa whelk reaches adulthood, it exists unchecked in the local population, and can consume and reproduce freely.
The Veined rapa whelk is also highly tolerant to wide variations in salinity and oxygen concentration, a fact that may also help to explain its success as an invader of marine coastal and brackish ecosystems. In its native range Rapana venosa shows high temperature tolerance, being able to withstand temperatures varying from 4 to 27 °C (39.2 - 80.6 °F).

Impact of introduction 
Veined rapa whelks have caused significant changes in the ecology of bottom-dwelling organisms, and have become marine pests in the Black Sea. Although scientists are not completely aware of the impacts of the whelk, they are very concerned about its potential impact on native Bay species. Studies are currently under way to help determine the whelk's spread in Chesapeake Bay, so that scientists can develop a model that will define potential impacts to the Bay's ecosystem.

Imposex 
The imposex phenomenon has been observed in the veined rapa whelk in Chesapeake Bay. Imposex is characterized by the development of masculine sexual organs in female individuals as a consequence of exposure to organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). Such compounds are biocide and antifouling agents, commonly mixed in paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. For this reason, it is not uncommon for high concentrations of such compounds to be present in the sea water near shipyards and docking areas, consequently exposing the nearby marine life to its possibly harmful effects. This unnatural development of male reproductive organs, however, has shown no negative effects on populations of this species, and no loss of reproductive capabilities of female R. venosa as a consequence of Imposex has been observed so far.

15,16367,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury%20trial,Jury trial,"A jury trial, or trial by jury, is a lawful proceeding in which a jury makes a decision or findings of fact. It is distinguished from a bench trial in which a judge or panel of judges makes all decisions.

Jury trials are used in a significant share of serious criminal cases in many but not all common law judicial systems. The majority of common law jurisdictions in Asia (such as Singapore, Pakistan, India, and Malaysia) have abolished jury trials on the grounds that juries are susceptible to bias. Juries or lay judges have also been incorporated into the legal systems of many civil law countries for criminal cases. Only the United States makes routine use of jury trials in a wide variety of non-criminal cases. Other common law legal jurisdictions use jury trials only in a very select class of cases that make up a tiny share of the overall civil docket (like malicious prosecution and false imprisonment suits in England and Wales), but true civil jury trials are almost entirely absent elsewhere in the world. Some civil law jurisdictions, however, have arbitration panels where non-legally trained members decide cases in select subject-matter areas relevant to the arbitration panel members' areas of expertise.

The use of jury trials, which evolved within common law systems rather than civil law systems, has had a profound impact on the nature of American civil procedure and criminal procedure rules, even if a bench trial is actually contemplated in a particular case. In general, the availability of a jury trial if properly demanded has given rise to a system in which fact finding is concentrated in a single trial rather than multiple hearings, and appellate review of trial court decisions is greatly limited. Jury trials are of far less importance (or of no importance) in countries that do not have a common law system.

History

Greece
Ancient Athens had a mechanism, called dikastaí, to assure that no one could select jurors for their own trial. For normal cases, the courts were made up of dikastai of up to 500 citizens. For capital cases—those that involved death, loss of liberty, exile, loss of civil rights, or seizure of property—the trial was before a jury of 1,001 to 1,501 dikastai. In such large juries, they rule by majority. Juries were appointed by lot. Jurists cast a ceramic disk with an axle in its middle: the axle was either hollow or solid. Thus the way they voted was kept secret because the jurists would hold their disk by the axle by thumb and forefinger, thus hiding whether its axle was hollow or solid. Since Periclean times, jurists were compensated for their sitting in court, with the amount of one day's wages.

The institution of trial by jury was ritually depicted by Aeschylus in The Eumenides, the third and final play of his Oresteia trilogy. In the play, the innovation is brought about by the goddess Athena, who summons twelve citizens to sit as jury. The god Apollo takes part in the trial as the advocate for the defendant Orestes and the Furies as prosecutors for the slain Clytemnestra. In the event the jury is split six to six, Athena dictates that the verdict should henceforth be for acquittal.

Roman Republic and Empire
From the beginning of the republic and in the majority of civil cases towards the end of the empire, there were tribunals with the characteristics of the jury in the sense that Roman judges were civilian, lay and not professionals. Capital trials were held in front of hundreds or thousands of 'juries' in the commitias or centuries, the same as in Athenian  trials. Roman law provided for the yearly selection of judices, who would be responsible for resolving disputes by acting as jurors, with a praetor performing many of the duties of a judge. High government officials and their relatives were barred from acting as judices, due to conflicts of interest. Those previously found guilty of serious crimes (felonies) were also barred as were gladiators for hire, who likely were hired to resolve disputes through trial by combat. The law was as follows:

Islamic law
The lafif in Maliki jurisprudence developed between the 8th and 11th centuries and stipulated that 12 members of the community would swear to tell the truth and reach a unanimous verdict about matters ""which they had personally seen or heard, binding on the judge, to settle the truth concerning facts in a case, between ordinary people, and obtained as of right by the plaintiff"". In the 12th century, Henry II of England similarly instituted a jury system of 12 free men charged to uncover the facts of the case with the same characteristics as the lafif system. He was likely influenced by his exchequer, Thomas Brown, who formerly worked under the diwan of the Kingdom of Sicily which had recently conquered the Emirate of Sicily and incorporated Islamic government and legal systems into their procedures. (The English tradition of trial by jury does not derive from Islamic law; for its origins, see below.)

Holy Roman Empire and modern Germany 
A Swabian ordinance of 1562 called for the summons of jurymen (), and various methods were in use in Emmendingen, Oppenau, and Oberkirch. Hauenstein's charter of 1442 secured the right to be tried in all cases by 24 fellow equals, and in Freiburg the jury was composed of 30 citizens and councilors. The modern jury trial was first introduced in the Rhenish provinces in 1798, with a court consisting most commonly of 12 citizens ().

The system whereby citizens were tried by their peers chosen from the entire community in open court was gradually superseded by a system of professional judges in Germany, in which the process of investigation was more or less confidential and judgements were issued by judges appointed by the state. In Constance the jury trial was suppressed by decree of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1786. The Frankfurt Constitution of the failed Revolutions of 1848 called for jury trials for ""the more serious crimes and all political offenses"", but was never implemented after the Frankfurt Parliament was dissolved by Württemberg dragoons. An 1873 draft on criminal procedure produced by the Prussian Ministry of Justice proposed to abolish the jury and replace it with the mixed system, causing a significant political debate. In the Weimar Republic the jury was abolished by the Emminger Reform of 4 January 1924.

Between 1948 and 1950 in American-occupied Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany, Bavaria returned to the jury trial as it had existed before the 1933 emergency decrees, but they were again abolished by the 1950 Unification Act () for the Federal Republic. In 1979, the United States tried the East German LOT Flight 165 hijacking suspects in the United States Court for Berlin in West Berlin, which declared the defendants had the right to a jury trial under the United States Constitution, and hence were tried by a West German jury.

England and Wales

According to George Macaulay Trevelyan in A Shortened History of England, during the Viking occupation: ""The Scandinavians, when not on the Viking warpath, were a litigious people and loved to get together in the thing [governing assembly] to hear legal argument. They had no professional lawyers, but many of their farmer-warriors, like Njáll Þorgeirsson, the truth-teller, were learned in folk custom and in its intricate judicial procedure. A Danish town in England often had, as its main officers, twelve hereditary 'law men.' The Danes introduced the habit of making committees among the free men in court, which perhaps made England favorable ground for the future growth of the jury system out of a Frankish custom later introduced by the Normans.""
The English king Æthelred the Unready set up an early legal system through the Wantage Code of Ethelred, one provision of which stated that the twelve leading thegns (minor nobles) of each wapentake (a small district) were required to swear that they would investigate crimes without a bias. These juries differed from the modern sort by being self-informing; instead of getting information through a trial, the jurors were required to investigate the case themselves.

In the 12th century, Henry II took a major step in developing the jury system. Henry II set up a system to resolve land disputes using juries. A jury of twelve free men were assigned to arbitrate in these disputes. As with the Saxon system, these men were charged with uncovering the facts of the case on their own rather than listening to arguments in court. Henry II also introduced what is now known as the ""grand jury"" through his Assize of Clarendon. Under the assize, a jury of free men was charged with reporting any crimes that they knew of in their hundred to a ""justice in eyre"", a judge who moved between hundreds on a circuit. A criminal accused by this jury was given a trial by ordeal.

The Church banned participation of clergy in trial by ordeal in 1215. Without the legitimacy of religion, trial by ordeal collapsed. The juries under the assizes began deciding guilt as well as providing accusations. The same year, trial by jury became an explicit right in one of the most influential clauses of Magna Carta. Article 39 of the Magna Carta read:

It is translated thus by Lysander Spooner in his Essay on the Trial by Jury:

Although it says ""and or by the law of the land"", this in no manner can be interpreted as if it were enough to have a positive law, made by the king, to be able to proceed legally against a citizen. The law of the land was the consuetudinary law, based on the customs and consent of John's subjects, and since they did not have Parliament in those times, this meant that neither the king nor the barons could make a law without the consent of the people.
According to some sources, in the time of Edward III, ""by the law of the land"" had been substituted ""by due process of law"", which in those times was a trial by twelve peers.

In 1215, Magna Carta further secured trial by jury by stating that

During the mid-14th century, persons who had sat on the Presenting Jury (i.e., in modern parlance, the grand jury) were forbidden to sit on the trial jury for that crime. 25 Edward III stat 5., c3 (1353). Medieval juries were self-informing, in that individuals were chosen as jurors because they either knew the parties and the facts, or they had the duty to discover them. This spared the government the cost of fact-finding. Over time, English juries became less self-informing and relied more on the trial itself for information on the case. Jurors remained free to investigate cases on their own until the 17th century. Magna Carta being forgotten after a succession of benevolent reigns (or, more probably, reigns limited by the jury and the barons, and only under the rule of laws that the juries and barons found acceptable), the kings, through the royal judges, began to extend their control over the jury and the kingdom. In David Hume's History of England, he tells something of the powers that the kings had accumulated in the times after Magna Carta, the prerogatives of the crown and the sources of great power with which these monarchs counted:

The first paragraph of the Act that abolished the Star Chamber repeats the clause on the right of a citizen to be judged by his peers:

In 1670 two Quakers charged with unlawful assembly, William Penn and William Mead, were found not guilty by a jury. The judge then fined the jury for contempt of court for returning a verdict contrary to their own findings of fact and removed them to prison until the fine was paid. Edward Bushel, a member of the jury, nonetheless refused to pay the fine.

Bushel petitioned the Court of Common Pleas for a writ of habeas corpus. The ruling in the Bushel's Case was that a jury could not be punished simply on account of the verdict it returned.

Many British colonies, including the United States, adopted the English common law system in which trial by jury is an important part. Jury trials in criminal cases were a protected right in the original United States Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Amendments of the U.S. Constitution extend the rights to trial by jury to include the right to jury trial for both criminal and civil matters and a grand jury for serious cases.

Role
In most common law jurisdictions, the jury is responsible for finding the facts of the case, while the judge determines the law. These ""peers of the accused"" are responsible for listening to a dispute, evaluating the evidence presented, deciding on the facts, and making a decision in accordance with the rules of law and their jury instructions. Typically, the jury only judges guilt or a verdict of not guilty, but the actual penalty is set by the judge. An interesting innovation was introduced in Russia in the judicial reform of Alexander II: unlike in modern jury trials, jurors decided not only whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty, but they had a third choice: ""Guilty, but not to be punished"", since Alexander II believed that justice without morality was wrong.

In France and some countries organized in the same fashion, the jury and several professional judges sit together to determine guilt first. Then, if guilt is determined, they decide the appropriate penalty.

Some jurisdictions with jury trials allow the defendant to waive their right to a jury trial, thus leading to a bench trial. Jury trials tend to occur only when a crime is considered serious. In some jurisdictions, such as France and Brazil, jury trials are reserved, and compulsory, for the most severe crimes and are not available for civil cases. In Brazil, for example, trials by jury are applied in cases of voluntary crimes against life, such as first and second degree murder, forced abortion and instigation of suicide, even if only attempted. In others, jury trials are only available for criminal cases and very specific civil cases (malicious prosecution, civil fraud and false imprisonment). In the United States, jury trials are available in both civil and criminal cases. In Canada, an individual charged with an indictable offence may elect to be tried by a judge alone in a provincial court, by judge alone in a superior court, or by judge and jury in a superior court; summary offences cannot be tried by jury. In England and Wales, offences are classified as summary, indictable, or either way; jury trials are not available for summary offences (using instead a summary proceeding with a panel of three lay magistrates or a district judge sitting alone), unless they are tried alongside indictable or either way offences that are themselves tried by jury, but the defendant has a right to demand trial by jury for either way offences. The situation is similar in Scotland; whereas in Northern Ireland even summary offences carry a right to jury trial, with some exceptions.

In the United States, because jury trials tend to be high profile, the general public tends to overestimate the frequency of jury trials. Approximately 150,000 jury trials are conducted in state courts annually, and an additional 5,000 jury trials are conducted in federal courts. Two thirds of jury trials are criminal trials, while one-third are civil and ""other"" (e.g., family, municipal ordinance, traffic). Nevertheless, the vast majority of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain, which bypasses the jury trial.

Some commentators contend that the guilty-plea system unfairly coerces defendants into relinquishing their right to a jury trial. Others contend that there never was a golden age of jury trials, but rather that juries in the early nineteenth century (before the rise of plea bargaining) were ""unwitting and reflexive, generally wasteful of public resources and, because of the absence of trained professionals, little more than slow guilty pleas themselves"", and that the guilty-plea system that emerged in the latter half of the nineteenth century was a superior, more cost-effective method of achieving fair outcomes.

Pros and cons

In countries where jury trials are common, juries are often seen as an important separation of powers. Another common assertion about the benefits of trial by jury is that it provides a means of educating citizens about government. Many also believe that a jury is likely to provide a more sympathetic hearing, or a fairer one, to a party who is not part of the government—or other establishment interest—than representatives of the state might.

This last point may be disputed. For example, in highly emotional cases, such as child rape, the jury may be tempted to convict based on personal feelings rather than on conviction beyond reasonable doubt. In France, former attorney, then later Minister of Justice Robert Badinter, remarked about jury trials in France that they were like ""riding a ship into a storm"", because they are much less predictable than bench trials.

Another issue with jury trials is the potential for jurors to exhibit discrimination. Infamous cases include the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine African-American teenagers accused of raping two White American women on a train in 1931, for which they were indicted by an all-white jury, the acquittal of two white men Roy Bryant and J. W. Milan by an all-white jury for the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till in 1955 (they admitted killing him in a magazine interview a year later), and the 1992 trial in the Rodney King case in California, in which white police officers were acquitted of excessive force in the beating of King, an African-American man. The jury consisted mostly of white people, and there were no African-American jurors.

The positive belief about jury trials in the UK and the U.S. contrasts with popular belief in many other nations, in which it is considered bizarre and risky for a person's fate to be put into the hands of untrained laymen. In Japan, for instance, which used to have optional jury trials for capital or other serious crimes between 1928 and 1943, the defendant could freely choose whether to have a jury or trial by judges, and the decisions of the jury were non-binding. During the Tojo regime this was suspended, arguably stemming from the popular belief that any defendant who risks his fate on the opinions of untrained laymen is almost certainly guilty.

One issue that has been raised is the ability of a jury to fully understand evidence. It has been said that the expectation of jury members as to the explanatory power of scientific evidence has been raised by TV police procedural and legal dramas, in what is known as the 'CSI effect' (after the American television programme). In at least one English trial the misuse or misunderstanding or misrepresentation by the prosecution of statistics has led to wrongful conviction.

In various countries

Argentina
Argentina is one of the first countries in Latin America that has implemented trial by jury. Although it has a civil law process, since November 2015, it has a jury system for serious criminal cases.

Australia
Section 80 of the Australian Constitution provides that: ""The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.

The first trials by civilian juries of 12 in the colony of New South Wales were held in 1824, following a decision of the NSW Supreme Court on 14 October 1824. The NSW Constitution Act of 1828 effectively terminated trial by jury for criminal matters. Jury trials for criminal matters revived with the passing of the Jury Trials Amending Act of 1833 (NSW) (2 William IV No 12).

Challenging potential jurors
The voir dire system of examining the jury pool before selection is not permitted in Australia as it violates the privacy of jurors. Therefore, though it exists, the right to challenge for cause during jury selection cannot be employed much. Peremptory challenges are usually based on the hunches of counsel and no reason is needed to use them. All Australian states allow for peremptory challenges in jury selection; however, the number of challenges granted to the counsels in each state are not all the same. Until 1987 New South Wales had twenty peremptory challenges for each side where the offence was murder, and eight for all other cases. In 1987 this was lowered to three peremptory challenges per side, the same amount allowed in South Australia. Eight peremptory challenges are allowed for both counsels for all offences in Queensland. Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory allow for six. Western Australia allows three peremptory challenges per side unless there is more than one accused in which case the prosecution can peremptorily challenge 3 times the number of accused and each accused has 3 peremptory challenges.

Majority and unanimous verdicts in criminal trials

In Australia majority verdicts are allowed in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and Queensland, while the ACT require unanimous verdicts. Since 1927 South Australia has permitted majority verdicts of 11:1, and 10:1 or 9:1 where the jury has been reduced, in criminal trials if a unanimous verdict cannot be reached in four hours. They are accepted in all cases except for ""guilty"" verdicts where the defendant is on trial for murder or treason. Victoria has accepted majority verdicts with the same conditions since 1994, though deliberations must go on for six hours before a majority verdict can be made. Western Australia accepted majority verdicts in 1957 for all trials except where the crime is murder or has a life sentence. A 10:2 verdict is accepted. Majority verdicts of 10:2 have been allowed in Tasmania since 1936 for all cases except murder and treason if a unanimous decision has not been made within two hours. Since 1943 verdicts of ""not guilty"" for murder and treason have also been included, but must be discussed for six hours. The Northern Territory has allowed majority verdicts of 10:2, 10:1 and 9:1 since 1963 and does not discriminate between cases whether the charge is murder or not. Deliberation must go for at least six hours before delivering a majority verdict. The Queensland Jury Act 1995 (s 59F) allows majority verdicts for all crimes except for murder and other offences that carry a life sentence, although only 11:1 or 10:1 majorities are allowed. Majority verdicts were introduced in New South Wales in 2006. In New South Wales, a majority verdict can only be returned if the jury consists of at least 11 jurors and the deliberation has occurred for at least 8 hours or for a period that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the case. Additionally, the court must be satisfied through examination of one or more of the jurors on oath, that a unanimous verdict will not be reached if further deliberation were to occur.

Austria
Austria, in common with a number of European civil law jurisdictions, retains elements of trial by jury in serious criminal cases.

Belgium
Belgium, in common with a number of European civil law jurisdictions, retains the trial by jury through the Court of Assize for serious criminal cases and for political crimes and for press delicts (except those based on racism or xenophobia), and for crimes of international law, such as genocide and crime against humanity.

Canada

Under Canadian law, a person has the constitutional right to a jury trial for all crimes punishable by five years of imprisonment or more. The Criminal Code also provides for the right to a jury trial for most indictable offences, including those punishable by less than five years' imprisonment, though the right is only constitutionally enshrined for those offences punishable by five years' imprisonment or more. Generally, it is the accused person who is entitled to elect whether their trial will proceed by judge alone or by judge and jury; however, for the most severe criminal offences—murder, treason, intimidating Parliament, inciting to mutiny, sedition, and piracy—trial by jury is mandatory unless the prosecution consents to trial by judge alone.

Jury panel exhaustion

Criminal Code Section 642(1): If a full jury and alternate jurors cannot be provided, the court may order the sheriff or other proper officer, at the request of the prosecutor, to summon without delay as many people as the court directs for the purpose of providing a full jury and alternate jurors.

Section 642(2): Jurors may be summoned under subsection (1) by word of mouth, if necessary.

Section 642(3): The names of the people who are summoned under this Section shall be added to the general panel for the purposes of the trial, and the same proceedings with respect to calling, challenging, excusing and directing them shall apply to them. 
 
According to the case of R v Mid-Valley Tractor Sales Limited (1995 CarswellNB 313), there are limitations on the powers granted by Section 642. These powers are conferred specifically upon the judge, and the section does not confer a further discretion to delegate that power to others, such as the sheriff's officer, even with the consent of counsel. The Court said that to hold otherwise would nullify the rights of the accused and the prosecution to object to a person being excused inappropriately, and may also interfere with the rights of the parties to challenge for cause. The selection of an impartial jury is the basis of a fair trial.

The Supreme Court of Canada also held in Basarabas and Spek v The Queen (1982 SCR 730) that the right of an accused to be present in court during the whole of his trial includes the jury selection process.

In Tran v The Queen (1994 2 SCR 951), it was held that an accused only has to show that they were excluded from a part of the trial that affected their vital interests, they do not have to demonstrate actual prejudice, just the potential for prejudice. As well, a valid waiver of such a right must be clear, unequivocal and done with full knowledge of the rights that the procedure was enacted to protect, as well as the effect that the waiver will have on those rights.

France
In France, a defendant is entitled to a jury trial only when prosecuted for a felony (crime in French). Crimes encompass all offenses that carry a penalty of at least 10 years' imprisonment (for natural persons) or a fine of €75,000 (for legal persons). The only court that tries by jury is the cour d'assises, in which three professional judges sit together with six or nine jurors (on appeal). Conviction requires a two-thirds majority (four or six votes).

Greece
The country that originated the concept of the jury trial retains it in an unusual form. The Constitution of Greece and Code of criminal procedure provide that felonies (Greek: Κακουργήματα) are tried by a ""mixed court"" composed of three professional judges, including the President of the Court, and four lay judges who decide the facts, and the appropriate penalty if they convict. Certain felonies, such as terrorism, are exempt, due to their nature, from the jurisdiction of the ""mixed courts"" and are tried instead by the Court of Appeals both in first and second instance.

Gibraltar
Being a Common Law jurisdiction, Gibraltar retains jury trial in a similar manner to that found in England and Wales, the exception being that juries consist of nine lay people, rather than twelve.

Hong Kong 
Hong Kong, as a former British colony has a common law legal system. Article 86 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, which came into force on 1 July 1997 following the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China provides: ""The principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained.""

Criminal trials in the High Court are by jury. The juries are generally made of seven members, who can return a verdict based on a majority of five.

There are no jury trials in the District Court, which can impose a sentence of up to seven years' imprisonment. This is despite the fact that all court rooms in the District Court have jury boxes. The lack of juries in the District Court has been severely criticized. Clive Grossman SC in a commentary in 2009 said conviction rates were ""approaching those of North Korea"".

Many complex commercial cases are prosecuted in the District Court rather than before a jury in the High Court. In 2009, Lily Chiang, former chairwoman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, lost an application to have her case transferred from the District Court to the High Court for a jury trial. Justice Wright in the Court of First Instance held that there was no absolute right to a trial by jury and that the ""decision as to whether an indictable offence be tried in the Court of First Instance by a judge and jury or in the District Court by a judge alone is the prerogative of the Secretary for Justice."" Chiang issued a statement at the time saying ""she was disappointed with the judgment because she has been deprived of a jury trial, an opportunity to be judged by her fellow citizens and the constitutional benefit protected by the Basic Law"".

In civil cases in the Court of First Instance jury trials are available for defamation, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution or seduction unless the court orders otherwise. A jury can return a majority verdict in a civil case.

Hungary

Hungary used a jury system from 1897 to 1919. Since 1949, Hungary uses the mixed court system. According to the Fundamental Law of Hungary, ""non-professional judges shall also participate in the administration of justice in the cases and ways specified in an Act."" In these cases, the court adjudicates in a panel which is composed of 1 professional judge as chair of the panel and 2 lay judges or 2 professional judges and 3 lay judges. Lay judges are elected by city councils and can be Hungarian citizens between the age of 30 and 70 years who have not been convicted. Non-professional judges have the same rights and responsibilities as professional judges, meaning that if they vote against the professional judge(s), their vote will decide the verdict. According to procedural laws, the youngest judge votes first and the chair of the panel votes last in case they reach a verdict through a vote.

India

The history of jury trials in India dates back to the period of European colonization. In 1665, a petit jury in Madras composed of twelve English and Portuguese jurors acquitted a Mrs. Ascentia Dawes, who was on trial for the murder of her enslaved servant. During the period of Company rule in India, jury trials within a dual-court system territories were implemented in Indian territories under East India Company (EIC) control. In Presidency towns (such as Calcutta, Bombai and Madras), Crown Courts employed juries to judge European and Indian defendants in criminal cases. Outside of Presidency towns, Company Courts staffed by EIC officials judged both criminal and civil cases without the use of a jury.

In 1860, after the British Crown assumed control over the EIC's possessions in India, the Indian Penal Code was adopted. A year later, the Code of Criminal Procedure was adopted in 1861. These new regulations stipulated that criminal juries were only mandatory in the High courts of Presidency towns; in all other parts of British India, they were optional and rarely utilized. In cases where the defendants were either European or American, at least half of the jury was required to be European or American men, with the justification given that juries in these cases had to be ""acquainted with [the defendant's] feelings and dispositions.""

During the 20th century, the jury system in British India came under criticism from both colonial officials and independence activists. The system received no mentions in the 1950 Indian Constitution and frequently went unimplemented in many Indian legal jurisdictions after independence in 1947. In 1958, the Law Commission of India recommended its abolition in the fourteenth report that the commission submitted to the Indian government. Jury trials in India were gradually abolished during the 1960's, culminating in the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, which remains in effect into the 21st century.

Parsis in India are legally permitted to use jury trials to decide divorces wherein randomly selected jurors (referred to in the Indian legal system as ""delegates"") from the local Parsi community are used to decide the outcome the matrimonial disputes in question during civil trials. This jury system consists of a mixture of common law juries and the Panchayati raj form of local government, and was first implemented during the period of British rule, with the colonial administration passing the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act in 1936. Post-independence, it was amended by the Indian government in 1988.

Ireland 
In the Republic of Ireland, a common law jurisdiction, jury trials are available for criminal cases before the Circuit Court, Central Criminal Court and defamation cases, consisting of twelve jurors.

Juries only decide questions of fact; they have no role in criminal sentencing in criminal cases or awarding damages in libel cases. It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict. In civil cases, a verdict may be reached by a majority of nine of the twelve members. In a criminal case, a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than eleven jurors if ten of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a reasonable time.

Juries are selected from a jury panel, which is picked at random by the county registrar from the electoral register. The principal statute regulating the selection, obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008, which scrapped the upper age limit of 70. Juries are not paid, nor do they receive travel expenses. They do receive lunch for the days that they are serving; however, for jurors in employment, their employer is required to pay them as if they were present at work.

For certain terrorist and organised crime offences the Director of Public Prosecutions may issue a certificate that the accused be tried by the Special Criminal Court composed of three judges instead of a jury, one from the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court.

Italy
The Corte d'Assise is composed of 2 judges and 6 laypersons chosen at random among Italian citizens 30 to 65 years old. Only serious crimes like murder can be tried by the Corte d'Assise.

Japan 

On May 28, 2004, the Diet of Japan enacted a law requiring selected citizens to take part in criminal court trials of certain severe crimes to make decisions together with professional judges, both on guilt and on the sentence. These citizens are called saiban-in (裁判員 ""lay judge""). The saiban-in system was implemented in May 2009.

Kuba Kingdom 
The Kuba Kingdom, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, developed trial by jury independently prior to the arrival of Europeans in 1884.

New Zealand 
The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 provides a defendant with the right to a jury trial if they are charged with a criminal offence punishable by two years' imprisonment or more. For most offences, the defendant can choose to forego a jury trial in favour of a judge-alone (bench) trial. Serious ""category 4"" offences such as murder, manslaughter and treason are always tried by jury, with some exceptions. Civil jury trials are restricted to cases involving defamation, false imprisonment or malicious prosecution.

New Zealand previously required jury verdicts to be passed unanimously, but since the passing of the Criminal Procedure Bill in 2009 the Juries Act 1981 has permitted verdicts to be passed by a majority of one less than the full jury (that is an 11–1 or a 10–1 majority) under certain circumstances.

Norway 
Norway has a system where the lower courts (tingrett) is set with a judge and two lay judges, or in bigger cases two judges and three lay judges.
All of these judges convict or acquit, and set sentences. Simple majority is required in all cases, which means that the lay-judges are always in control.

In the higher court/appellate court (lagmannsrett) there is a jury (lagrette) of 10 members, which need a minimum of seven votes to be able to convict. The judges have no say in the jury deliberations, but jury instructions are given by the chief judge (lagmann) in each case to the jury before deliberations. The voir-dire is usually set with 16 prospective jurors, which the prosecution and defence may dismiss the six persons they do not desire to serve on the jury.

This court (lagmannsretten) is administered by a three-judge panel (usually one lagmann and two lagdommere), and if seven or more jury members want to convict, the sentence is set in a separate proceeding, consisting of the three judges and the jury foreman (lagrettens ordfører) and three other members of the jury chosen by ballot. This way the laymen are in control of both the conviction and sentencing, as simple majority is required in sentencing.

The three-judge panel can set aside a jury conviction or acquittal if there has been an obvious miscarriage of justice. In that event, the case is settled by three judges and four lay-judges.

In May 2015, the Norwegian Parliament asked the government to bring an end to jury trials, replacing them with a bench trial (meddomsrett) consisting of two law-trained judges and five lay judges (lekdommere). This has now been fully implemented  as of March 2021.

Russia 
In the judiciary of Russia, for serious crimes the accused has the option of a jury trial consisting of 12 jurors. The number of jury trials remains small, at about 600 per year, out of about 1 million trials. A juror must be 25 years old, legally competent, and without a criminal record. The 12 jurors are selected by the prosecution and defense from a list of 30–40 eligible candidates. The Constitution of Russia stipulates that, until the abolition of the death penalty, all defendants in a case that may result in a death sentence are entitled to a jury trial. Lawmakers are continuously chipping away at what types of criminal offenses merit a jury trial.

They are similar to common law juries, and unlike lay judges, in that they sit separately from the judges and decide questions of fact alone while the judge determines questions of law. They must return unanimous verdicts during the first 3 hours of deliberation, but may return majority verdicts after that, with 6 jurors being enough to acquit. They may also request that the judge show leniency in sentencing.

Juries have granted acquittals in 15–20% of cases, compared with less than 1% in cases decided by judges. Juries may be dismissed and skeptical juries have been dismissed on the verge of verdicts, and acquittals are frequently overturned by higher courts.

Trial by jury was first introduced in the Russian Empire as a result of the Judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864, and abolished after the October Revolution in 1917. They were reintroduced in the Russian Federation in 1993, and extended to another 69 regions in 2003. Its reintroduction was opposed by the Prosecutor General.

Singapore
Singapore fully abolished the jury system in 1969, though jury trials for non-capital offenses had already been abolished a decade earlier. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, a former trial lawyer, explained why he supported the policy to the BBC and in his memoirs, saying, ""I had no faith in a system that allowed the superstition, ignorance, biases, and prejudices of seven jurymen to determine guilt or innocence.""

South Africa
The jury system was abolished in South Africa in 1969 by the Abolition of Juries Act, 1969. The last jury trial to be heard was in the District of Kimberley. Some judicial experts had argued that a system of whites-only juries (as was the system at that time) was inherently prejudicial to 'non-white' defendants (the introduction of nonracial juries would have been a political impossibility at that time). More recently it has been argued that, apart from being a racially divided country, South African society was, and still is, characterised by significant class differences and disparities of income and wealth that could make re-introducing the jury system problematic. Arguments for and against the re-introduction of a jury system have been discussed by South African constitutional expert Professor Pierre de Vos in the article ""Do we need a jury system?"" On 28 March 2014, the Oscar Pistorius trial was adjourned due to the illness of one of the two assessors that assist the judge on questions of fact (rather than law), in place of the jury, to reach a verdict. The legal system in the UK sees no reason to block extradition on this, as witnessed in the Shrien Dewani case.

Sweden
In Sweden, juries are uncommon; the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges (nämndemän). However, the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court (tingsrätt) when accused of an offence against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If a person is accused of e.g. libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors. This applies also in civil (tort) cases under the fundamental laws. A majority of at least six jurors must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime. If it does not, the defendant is acquitted or, in a civil case, held not liable. If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed, this finding is not legally binding for the court; thus, the court (three judges) can still acquit the defendant or find him/her not liable. A jury acquittal may not be overruled after appeal. In Swedish civil process, the ""English rule"" applies to court costs. Earlier, a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could, when deciding on the matter of such costs, set aside the English rule, and instead use the American rule, that each party bears its own expense of litigation. This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6.2. of the European Convention on Human Rights, by the Supreme Court of Sweden, in 2012.

Switzerland
As of 2008, only the code of criminal procedure of the Canton of Geneva provides for genuine jury trials. Several other cantons—Vaud, Neuchâtel, Zürich and Ticino—provide for courts composed of both professional judges and laymen (Schöffengerichte / tribunaux d'échevins). Because the unified Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure (set to enter into force in 2011) does not provide for jury trials or lay judges, however, they are likely to be abolished in the near future.

Ukraine
The judiciary of Ukraine allows jury trials for criminal cases where the sentence can reach life imprisonment if the accused so wishes. But this seldom happens. A jury is not formed from random citizens, but only from those who have previously applied for this role who do meet certain criteria.

United Kingdom
The United Kingdom consists of three separate legal jurisdictions, but there are some features common to all of them. In particular there is seldom anything like the U.S. voir dire system; jurors are usually just accepted without question. Controversially, in England there has been some screening in sensitive security cases, but the Scottish courts have firmly set themselves against any form of jury vetting.

England and Wales

In England and Wales (which have the same legal system), everyone accused of an offence which carries more than six months' imprisonment has a right to trial by jury. Minor (""summary"") criminal cases are heard without a jury in the Magistrates' Courts. Middle-ranking (""triable either way"") offences may be tried by magistrates or the defendant may elect trial by jury in the Crown Court. Serious (""indictable-only"") offences, however, must be tried before a jury in the Crown Court. Juries sit in few civil cases, being restricted to false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and civil fraud (unless ordered otherwise by a judge). Juries also sit in coroner's courts for more contentious inquests. All criminal juries consist of 12 jurors, those in a County Court having 8 jurors and Coroner's Court juries having between 7 and 11 members. Jurors must be between 18 and 75 years of age, and are selected at random from the register of voters. In the past a unanimous verdict was required. This has been changed so that, if the jury fails to agree after a given period, at the discretion of the judge they may reach a verdict by a 10–2 majority. This was designed to make it more difficult for jury tampering to succeed.

In 1999 the then Home Secretary Jack Straw introduced a controversial bill to limit the right to trial by jury. This became the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which sought to remove the right to trial by jury for cases involving jury tampering or complex fraud. The provision for trial without jury to circumvent jury tampering succeeded and came into force in 2007; the provision for complex fraud cases was defeated. Lord Goldsmith, the then Attorney General, then pressed forward with the Fraud (Trials Without a Jury) Bill in Parliament, which sought to abolish jury trials in major criminal fraud trials. The Bill was subject to sharp criticism from both sides of the House of Commons before passing its second Commons reading in November 2006, but was defeated in the Lords in March 2007.

The trial for the first serious offence to be tried without a jury for 350 years was allowed to go ahead in 2009. Three previous trials of the defendants had been halted because of jury tampering, and the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, cited cost and the additional burden on the jurors as reasons to proceed without a jury. Previously in cases where jury tampering was a concern the jurors were sometimes closeted in a hotel for the duration of the trial. However, Liberty director of policy Isabella Sankey said that ""This is a dangerous precedent. The right to jury trial isn't just a hallowed principle but a practice that ensures that one class of people don't sit in judgement over another and the public have confidence in an open and representative justice system.""

The trial started in 2010, with the four defendants convicted on the 31 March 2010 by Mr Justice Treacy at the Old Bailey.

Scotland

In Scots law the jury system has some similarities with England but some important differences; in particular, there are juries of 15 in criminal trials, with verdicts by simple majority.

Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the role of the jury trial is roughly similar to England and Wales, except that jury trials have been replaced in cases of alleged terrorist offences by courts where the judge sits alone, known as Diplock courts. Diplock courts are common in Northern Ireland for crimes connected to terrorism.

Diplock courts were created in the 1970s during The Troubles, to phase out Operation Demetrius internments, and because of the argument that juries were intimidated, though this is disputed. The Diplock courts were shut in 2007, but between 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2009, 13 non-jury trials were held, down from 29 in the previous year, and 300 trials per year at their peak.

United States

The availability of a trial by jury in American jurisdictions varies. Because the United States legal system separated from that of the English one at the time of the American Revolution, the types of proceedings that use juries depends on whether such cases were tried by jury under English common law at that time rather than the methods used in English courts now. For example, at the time, English ""courts of law"" tried cases of torts or private law for monetary damages using juries, but ""courts of equity"" that tried civil cases seeking an injunction or another form of non-monetary relief did not. As a result, this practice continues in American civil laws, but in modern English law, only criminal proceedings and some inquests are likely to be heard by a jury.

A distinctive feature of jury trials in the United States is that verdicts in criminal cases must usually be unanimous.

Every person accused of a crime punishable by incarceration for more than six months has a constitutionally protected right to a trial by jury, which arises in federal court from Article Three of the United States Constitution, which states in part, ""The Trial of all Crimes...shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed."" The right was expanded with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states in part, ""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed."" Both provisions were made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Most states' constitutions also grant the right of trial by jury in lesser criminal matters, though most have abrogated that right in offenses punishable by fine only. The Supreme Court has ruled that if imprisonment is for six months or less, trial by jury is not required, meaning a state may choose whether or not to permit trial by jury in such cases. Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, if the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, he may waive his right to have a jury, but both the government (prosecution) and court must consent to the waiver. Several states require jury trials for all crimes, ""petty"" or not.

In the cases Apprendi v. New Jersey, , and Blakely v. Washington, , the Supreme Court of the United States held that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence, but any fact used to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines. This invalidated the procedure in many states and the federal courts that allowed sentencing enhancement based on ""a preponderance of evidence"", where enhancement could be based on the judge's findings alone. Depending upon the state, a jury must be unanimous for either a guilty or not guilty decision. A hung jury results in the defendants release, however charges against the defendant are not dropped and can be reinstated if the state so chooses.

Jurors in some states are selected through voter registration and drivers' license lists. A form is sent to prospective jurors to pre-qualify them by asking the recipient to answer questions about citizenship, disabilities, ability to understand the English language, and whether they have any conditions that would excuse them from being a juror. If they are deemed qualified, a summons is issued.

English common law and the United States Constitution recognize the right to a jury trial to be a fundamental civil liberty or civil right that allows the accused to choose whether to be judged by judges or a jury.

In the United States, it is understood that juries usually weigh the evidence and testimony to determine questions of fact, while judges usually rule on questions of law, although the dissenting justices in the Supreme Court case Sparf et al. v. U.S. 156 U.S. 51 (1895), generally considered the pivotal case concerning the rights and powers of the jury, declared: ""It is our deep and settled conviction, confirmed by a re-examination of the authorities that the jury, upon the general issue of guilty or not guilty in a criminal case, have the right, as well as the power, to decide, according to their own judgment and consciences, all questions, whether of law or of fact, involved in that issue."" Jury determination of questions of law, sometimes called jury nullification, cannot be overturned by a judge if doing so would violate legal protections against double jeopardy. Although a judge can throw out a guilty verdict if it was not supported by the evidence, a jurist has no authority to override a verdict that favors a defendant.

It was established in Bushel's Case that a judge cannot order the jury to convict, no matter how strong the evidence is. In civil cases a special verdict can be given, but in criminal cases a general verdict is rendered, because requiring a special verdict could apply pressure to the jury, and because of the jury's historic function of tempering rules of law by common sense brought to bear upon the facts of a specific case. For this reason, Justice Black and Justice Douglas indicated their disapproval of special interrogatories even in civil cases.

There has been much debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the jury system, the competence or lack thereof of jurors as fact-finders, and the uniformity or capriciousness of the justice they administer. The jury has been described by one author as ""an exciting and gallant experiment in the conduct of serious human affairs"". Because they are fact-finders, juries are sometimes expected to perform a role similar to a lie detector, especially when presented with testimony from witnesses.

A civil jury is typically made up of 6 to 12 persons. In a civil case, the role of the jury is to listen to the evidence presented at a trial, to decide whether the defendant injured the plaintiff or otherwise failed to fulfill a legal duty to the plaintiff, and to determine what the compensation or penalty should be.

A criminal jury is usually made up of 12 members, though fewer may sit on cases involving lesser offenses. Criminal juries decide whether the defendant committed the crime as charged. In several southern states, the jury sets punishment, while in most states and at the federal level, it is set by the judge.

Prior to 2020, under most states' laws, verdicts in criminal cases must be unanimous with the exception of Oregon and Louisiana. In Oregon, a 10–2 majority was required for conviction, except for capital crimes which require unanimous verdicts for guilty in any murder case. In Oregon, unlike any other state, a Not Guilty verdict may be reached in any case (murder included) by a vote of 10 to 2 or 11 to 1. Louisiana also did not require unanimous juries in serious felony cases until passage of a state constitutional amendment going into effect for crimes committed on or after January 1, 2019. However, in Ramos v. Louisiana, decided in April 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that felony convictions must be a unanimous vote from the jury, overturning Oregon's and Louisiana's prior allowances for split decisions.

In civil cases, the law (or the agreement of the parties) may permit a non-unanimous verdict.

A jury's deliberations are conducted in private, out of sight and hearing of the judge, litigants, witnesses, and others in the courtroom.

Not every case is eligible for a jury trial. For example, in the majority of U.S. states there is no right to a jury trial in family law actions not involving a termination of parental rights, such as divorce and custody modifications. As of 1978, eleven U.S. states allow juries in any aspect of divorce litigation, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. Most of these limit the right to a jury to try issues regarding grounds or entitlement for divorce only. Texas provides jury trial rights most broadly, including even the right to a jury trial on questions regarding child custody. However, anyone who is charged with a criminal offense, breach of contract or federal offence has a Constitutional right to a trial by jury.

Civil trial procedure

The right to trial by jury in a civil case in federal court is addressed by the Seventh Amendment. Importantly, however, the Seventh Amendment does not guarantee a right to a civil jury trial in state courts (although most state constitutions guarantee such a right). The Seventh Amendment provides: ""In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."" In Joseph Story's 1833 treatise Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, he wrote, ""[I]t is a most important and valuable amendment; and places upon the high ground of constitutional right the inestimable privilege of a trial by jury in civil cases, a privilege scarcely inferior to that in criminal cases, which is conceded by all to be essential to political and civil liberty.""

The Seventh Amendment does not guarantee or create any right to a jury trial; rather, it preserves the right to jury trial in the federal courts that existed in 1791 at common law. In this context, common law means the legal environment the United States inherited from England. In England in 1791, civil actions were divided into actions at law and actions in equity. Actions at law had a right to a jury, actions in equity did not. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 2 says ""[t]here is one form of action—the civil action"", which abolishes the legal/equity distinction. Today, in actions that would have been ""at law"" in 1791, there is a right to a jury; in actions that would have been ""in equity"" in 1791, there is no right to a jury. However, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c) allows a court to use one at its discretion. To determine whether the action would have been legal or equitable in 1791, one must first look at the type of action and whether such an action was considered ""legal"" or ""equitable"" at that time. Next, the relief being sought must be examined. Monetary damages alone were purely a legal remedy, and thus entitled to a jury. Non-monetary remedies such as injunctions, rescission, and specific performance were all equitable remedies, and thus up to the judge's discretion, not a jury. In Beacon Theaters, Inc. v. Westover, , the US Supreme Court discussed the right to a jury, holding that when both equitable and legal claims are brought, the right to a jury trial still exists for the legal claim, which would be decided by a jury before the judge ruled on the equitable claim.

There is not a United States constitutional right under the Seventh Amendment to a jury trial in state courts, but in practice, almost every state except Louisiana, which has a civil law legal tradition, permits jury trials in civil cases in state courts on substantially the same basis that they are allowed under the Seventh Amendment in federal court. The right to a jury trial in civil cases does not extend to the states, except when a state court is enforcing a federally created right, of which the right to trial by jury is a substantial part.

The court determines the right to jury based on all claims by all parties involved. If the plaintiff brings only equitable claims but the defendant asserts counterclaims of law, the court grants a jury trial. In accordance with Beacon Theaters, the jury first determines the facts, then the judge enter judgment on the equitable claims.

Following the English tradition, U.S. juries have usually been composed of 12 jurors, and the jury's verdict has usually been required to be unanimous. However, in many jurisdictions, the number of jurors is often reduced to a lesser number (such as five or six) by legislative enactment, or by agreement of both sides. Some jurisdictions also permit a verdict to be returned despite the dissent of one, two, or three jurors.

Waiver of jury trial
The vast majority of U.S. criminal cases are not concluded with a jury verdict, but rather by plea bargain. Both prosecutors and defendants often have a strong interest in resolving the criminal case by negotiation resulting in a plea bargain. If the defendant waives a jury trial, a bench trial is held.

For civil cases, a jury trial must be demanded within a certain period of time per Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 38.

In United States Federal courts, there is no absolute right to waive a jury trial. Per Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 23(a), only if the prosecution and the court consent may a defendant waive a jury trial for criminal cases. However, most states give the defendant the absolute right to waive a jury trial, and it has become commonplace to find such a waiver in routine contracts as a 2004 Wall Street Journal article states:

The article goes on to claim:

In the years since this 2004 article, this practice has become pervasive in the US and, especially in online agreements, it has become commonplace to include such waivers to trial by jury in everything from user agreements attached to software downloads to merely browsing a website. This practice, however, means that while such waivers may have legal force in one jurisdiction—in this case the United States—in the jurisdiction where a verdict is sought in the absence of jury trial (or indeed the presence of a defendant, or any legal representation in absentia) may well run directly counter to law in the jurisdiction—such as the United Kingdom—where the defendant resides, thus:

The judgment on R v Jones [2002] UKHL 5 issued by the United Kingdom's House of Lords states (in part, in Item 55) ""the issue has to be determined by looking at the way in which the courts handled the problem under English criminal procedure and by deciding whether, in the result, the appellant can be said to have had a fair hearing.""

Jury trials: terminating parental rights 
Only five of the 50 states require or permit jury trials for cases where the state is seeking to legally sever a parent-child relationship. Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In Virginia, the jury is called an ""advisory jury"". The remaining 46 jurisdictions have case law or statutes or local court rules or common practice that specifically prohibits a jury trial in termination of parental rights cases. The fate of a family is exclusively placed in the hands of a single judge when there is no jury trial.

The mall itself has been the target of a few bomb threats; one of them was made on US We the People governmental petition website by an individual with suspected neo-Nazi connections calling himself ""Thomas Utoyo"" or ""thomas.littleevil"" who in a few days prior to that and coincidentally on a date which is the 5th anniversary of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 tragedy, was involved in posting similar threats on the 8chan imageboard against a library in the Russian House of Science and Culture in Berlin, Germany and an Aeroflot flight flying from Berlin to Moscow, together with vibes referencing that of popular YouTuber PewDiePie and 2003 Japanese horror film One Missed Call.

Crocus Expo

Crocus Expo is the adjacently located trade fair and business centre, also built, run and operated by Crocus International. It is the largest business centre in Russia.

Since 2011, Crocus hosts annual video game exhibition Igromir, which was moved there from VDNKh exhibition center due to an increasing number of visitors. Over a hundred thousand visitors attend Igromir in Crocus each year. In 2014 Crocus Expo also hosted the first Comic-Con Russia and in 2016 it received a bomb threat via phone call which caused its evacuation. A concert hall in the neighboring Crocus City Hall received similar threat a year later.

18,4097107,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt%20Barthel,Kurt Barthel,"Kurt Barthel (1884–1969) is the father of the modern United States nudist movement.

Introduction

He began the American League for Physical Culture in 1929 with an ad, first in the leading German nudist magazines published in Berlin by Robert Laurer ""Lichtland"" (Light Land) and ""Lachendes Leben"" (Laughing Life), then later in a newspaper seeking like-minded folks. The first organized nudist outing was held on Labor Day 1929. There were seven people in attendance, three women and four men, all but one between the ages of 20 and 27. The first outing was held in the Hudson Highlands in upstate New York. The American League for Physical Culture was organized in the fall of 1929 and took part in the beginning of the American nudist movement. The members of the ALPC visited leased farms in Westchester County in the summer and participated in gymnastics in rented gymnasiums and pools in the city in winter.

About 1930 three members stepped out of the ALPC and formed their own groups, one of whom formed the American Gymnosophical Association which shortly thereafter leased Rock Lodge Club in Stockholm, New Jersey. The American Sunbathing Association (ASA) — now called the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) — was an outgrowth or spin off from ALPC.

Another who played a part in the United States nudist movement was Dr. Maurice Parmelee, who took part in the founding of the American Gymnosophical Association and published the 1927 book The New Gymnosophy in New York whose title was changed to Nudism In Modern Life in later editions. The first copies of the book were sold under the counter by a large reputable book seller in New York City.

Sky Farm

Barthel founded America's first official nudist camp in New Jersey, in May, 1932 when nudists and nudism were not accepted at all by the American public, during the Great Depression. Sky Farm continues to function as a member owned co-operative club.

In a newspaper article it is stated that in 1933 the American League, having a post office box for a New York address, was buying a farm in New Jersey that had been visited and approved by the chief of police, but would not divulge its location and the American Gymnosophical Association, having an office in Manhattan, New York had leased land in the Catskills, New York and a  farm nearer to New York City. The American Gymnosophical Associates had substantial foundation at Rock Lodge. Rock Lodge Club continues to function as a member owned co-operative club.

19,19298451,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai%20Harem%3A%20Asu%20no%20Yoichi,Samurai Harem: Asu no Yoichi,"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yū Minamoto. It was serialized in Monthly Shōnen Champion from October 2006 to March 2011. The manga is licensed and released in Chinese by Sharp Point Press. The manga was formerly licensed in North America by Tokyopop as Samurai Harem: Asu no Yoichi!.

It has been adapted into an anime television series by AIC and was broadcast in Japan on TBS between January 8, 2009 and March 26, 2009.

Plot
After learning martial arts in the mountains for 17 years under his father's teachings, Yoichi Karasuma's father orders Yoichi to continue his training to strengthen his spirit with the Ikaruga family in the city, as he has nothing left to teach him (but really because Yoichi has become stronger and far more skilled than him). The current assistant head of the Ukiha Divine Wind Style Swordplay school of martial arts in the city, Ibuki Ikaruga, and her siblings gradually accept Yoichi as a freeloader at their dojo. In addition to domestic problems, Yoichi deals with local bad-boy Washizu's jealousy of Ibuki and Yoichi's supposed relationship, his school life and various attempts by other martial arts schools to assassinate him or destroy the Ikaruga dojo.

Characters

A high school sophomore who is also a young swordsman and has moved away from his mountain life to live with the Ikarugas in the city to continue his training. He is a very active person who actively enjoys martial arts with swordsmanship in particular; he has a catchphrase ""de gozaru"" after each statement he uses. Due to his early childhood in the mountains with his father, he does not know the current customs in Japan or how to act around a girl. He is very honorable, which is shown when he addresses everyone with the  honorific. However, due to constant misunderstandings, Ibuki, in particular, constantly attacks him under the assumption that he had done something perverted. He is usually seen wearing a Japanese martial arts uniform and a wooden sword. He is a freeloader at Ikaruga Dojo and is a student of the Ukiha Kamikaze Swordplay (Soaring Wing, Divine Wind Style). He attends the private school Yoku-Ryou Gakuen with Ibuki and Ayame, and he's in the same class as Ibuki and Washizu. He was convinced to join the Acting Club and was initially paired with Ibuki to play the main hero and heroine of a love-play, but Ayame took over Ibuki's role afterwards so she could get closer to Yoichi. He always gets nosebleeds after unintentionally doing or seeing something perverted, usually the latter, but also when Ibuki has hit him with his own sword because of a supposed lecherous act on his part. His training in swordsmanship has left him with greatly advanced fighting skills; one of the key factors in his coming to the city was to earn experience to add to his knowledge (but really, although he doesn't know it, because he had become stronger and better than his father). He is also oblivious to the fact that Ayame, Ibuki, and Angela are in love with him.

Ikaruga family

Ibuki is a high school sophomore who became the de facto head of the Ikaruga family after their parents went overseas (in the manga it is explained that this is due to a curse placed on their father and he and their mother are searching for a way to remove it). She is popular at school due to her beauty and scholastic/sports ability; she is President of her class at school and is good at studies, sports and martial arts. She secretly likes Yoichi but is the first to attack him whenever he becomes embroiled in a situation, usually involving other girls, whether he is at fault or not. In the absence of her father she is the Assistant Instructor of Ikaruga Dojo, which teaches Ukiha Kamikaze Swordplay but there are only five students in her dojo due to her violent nature;  however, she treats children in a maternal fashion. It is revealed in chapter 19.5 of the manga that her violent nature developed when her parents left Ibuki to look after her siblings at an early age. As the story progresses, after coming to terms with the hardships that fell to her after her parents left, thanks to Yoichi and her sisters, she realizes she is in love with him.

Ayame is a freshman in high school and Ibuki's younger sister. She has a shy, tsundere personality, has a highly-developed sense of fashion and is almost always acutely aware of her small breast size when compared to those of her siblings; a revelation about Kagome's own chest size in Chapter 9 leaves Ayame totally stunned. It took a while for her to come to like Yoichi romantically and she tries to help him at times while protesting that it is for no particular reason. She is bad with household chores in general and dislikes being compared to Ibuki, whom she feels completely overshadows her, to the point where she has decided to not even try to compete with Ibuki; however, Yoichi's arrival and stay with them has caused Ayame to not only try and overcome her self-consciousness and make improvements in her life and outlook but also to become more open about her love for her family (Ibuki herself notes that Yoichi has ""given [Ayame] back her smile""). She has kissed Yoichi twice (while he was unconscious during the performance of a school play - the first unintentionally but the second kiss was intentional). Unfortunately, due to a series of misunderstandings, everyone thinks that she and Washizu are becoming a couple, to both her and Washizu's mutual annoyance. Despite her apparent disdain towards kendo, she is quite knowledgeable about the Ukiha Kamikaze style and since Yoichi's ariival has returned to practicing at the Ikaruga dojo (also to be closer to Yoichi),  at times acts as an instructor (usually to Washizu, who would prefer that Ibuki be his teacher).

Chihaya is a 15-year-old, 3rd year junior high school student and the second youngest (and most sexually frank) of the Ikaruga family. She is also a professional manga artist who uses her siblings and Yoichi as inspiration for her manga by manipulating events to bring about more satisfying resolutions. She also seems the most knowledgeable of the sisters about relationships as she flirts with Yoichi while poking fun at the others. She is the only person in the Ikaruga family to wear glasses. It is revealed towards the end of the manga that she actually witnessed the incident that caused her parents to leave, but the circumstances were so terrifying that she deliberately blocked out everything. Her signature hair antennae are reminiscent of Naru Narusegawa's from Love Hina.

Kagome is the youngest of the Ikaruga family and an elementary school student. She is 10 years old in the anime. Kagome is exceptionally proficient at household chores and cooking, especially for someone her age. While she is generally clumsy at sports and martial arts (much to Ibuki's dismay), she is an excellent swimmer and in Chapter 25 she learns how to successfully do a back-flip for Parents Visitation Day at her school, to the delight of her attending sisters and Yoichi. She has a shy personality and because her breasts are already bigger than Ayame's, she binds them to spare her sister's feelings. She is close friends with Masashi, one of the Ikuraga Dojo's students.

Classmates

Washizu (also known as ""Wa-san"") is Ibuki's classmate and a famous delinquent who originally trained as a boxer and is very good at street fighting. At the beginning of the manga, Washizu was depicted as a loner and the only friend he had was Torigaya; he fought Yoichi twice and was defeated both times (in the second fight, he tried to use a switchblade [in the anime, spiked iron knuckles], but Yoichi shattered it with his bare hands). As the manga progressed, Washizu kept his fearsome reputation but started being friendly to other people around him. Washizu has a crush on Ibuki  and joined the classes at the Ikuraga Dojo in order to get closer to her, and because of his misunderstanding of the relationship between Yoichi and Ibuki, he despises Yoichi and sees him as a perverted pimp who plays around with many girls, including Ibuki; however, he occasionally teams up with Yoichi to fight a common enemy. Every attempt on his part to tell or show Ibuki his true feelings somehow ends disastrously, and Instead of confessing his true feelings to her, he accidentally confessed to Ibuki's sister Ayame, and they started acting as a comic relief of the manga. They usually think together how they could get close to their respective love interests: Ibuki for Washizu, Yoichi for Ayame. The ""Washizu Fantasy Channel"" in the manga and ""Washizu Vision"" in the anime are all Washizu's misinterpretations of the situation, usually concerning Ibuki; they can also be Washizu's fantasies. In spite of all the misunderstandings and mishaps, Washizu can at times be very understanding and sensitive.

Torigaya is Washizu's only friend until Washizu started opening himself to other people. She usually acts cocky and arrogant when she is with Washizu and is very fond of children. Both in the anime and manga she started looking like a male, but chapter after chapter she apparently shrinks in size and shows more feminine traits. In the anime, her actual gender is suddenly revealed in the last chapter, while in the manga the change is much more gradual, having the first hint towards her actual gender when she dresses as a maid in chapter 37. This change seems to be noticed only by Washizu.

Tsubame Benten Ryuu Dojo

Tsubasa is the next heir of the Tsubame Tenryu Ryouge, a martial arts school threatening to collapse due to lack of funds, and was originally hired by Ukyou Sakinomiya to assassinate Yoichi. She is a clumsy and shy girl who dreams of having a normal life. She insisted to her subordinate Angela that she should go to the same school as Yoichi so she would have a good opportunity to assassinate him, although her true motive was to be a normal high school girl. In one incident, she instinctively slices a soccer ball heading towards her in front of her classmates and becomes depressed when everyone is awed by her. Yoichi then compliments her abilities and Ibuki chastises everyone else for being too inquisitive, which eases the tension of the scene. She later develops a crush on Washizu because he was the first person to treat her normally (even though she considers Yoichi to be her first friend due to his actions in the soccer ball incident), but she is hurt deeply after hearing Washizu saying that he hates martial arts.  After school, Angela ripped Tsubasa's clothes off in public, causing her to turn into a deadly martial artist in a trance-like state due to her embarrassment and attacks Yoichi at Angela's orders. However, when Washizu interrupted their fight, Tsubasa broke out of her trance and fled the scene crying in humiliation. Later, she told Angela that she hates both martial arts and Angela. Later that evening, she forgives Angela and the following day they start working at a ramen shop together. Later on, Yoichi convinces her to return to her family and explain her feelings to them, especially her wish not to become the heir; after they accept her decision, she happily returns with Angela to her life and friends in the city. Like Washizu, she has her own version of the Washizu Fantasy Channel/Washizu Vision called the Tsubame Fantasy Channel (""Tsubame Vision"" in the anime). Her full name translates to ""Sparrow's Wings"" or ""Wings of a Sparrow"" in Western order.

Angela is a 16-year-old girl (in the anime she seems older) and Tsubasa's subordinate, who Yoichi describes as being ""as tall as a model with a dynamic body"". Angela was hired by Ukyou Sakinomiya to assassinate Yoichi and she has been observing Tsubasa because she thought that the next heir of Tsubame Tenryu Ryouge should assassinate Yoichi. After she witnesses Tsubasa's lack of interest in proceeding with the job, she ripped off Tsubasa's clothes so she would turn into a deadly weapon, but the fight between Tsubasa and Yoichi was interrupted by Washizu. After Tsubasa left because of the embarrassment, Angela followed her and was in deep shock after hearing Tsubasa say that she hates both martial arts and Angela. She then attempted to assassinate Yoichi that night by herself. In the manga she was scared by Ibuki's sisters whom she mistook for ghosts. After she reached Yoichi's room, she attempted to assassinate him, but thanks to his intense training (which included staying on guard even during sleep) Yoichi avoided all of her attacks even while fast asleep. Angela was taken off guard and was sexually harassed by Yoichi while he was still sleeping, but was saved by Ibuki and her sisters. After Yoichi woke up, she explained everything to the Ikarugas about the assassination plot and her assassination attempt (this happened in the manga). Yoichi lectured her about her mercenary ways and that she should use her martial art skills with pride as a member of the Tsubame Tenryu Ryouge as well for the revival of her martial arts school. In the anime, there are no ghosts and her attack occurs outdoors, but it also ends with Yoichi foiling the attack and lecturing her. Afterwards, in both versions, she leaves the dojo and encounters Tsubasa, who has already forgiven Angela for her previous actions. The following day, Yoichi and Ibuki find that Angela and Tsubasa are working at a ramen shop, determined to revive their style on their own merits. In the manga, Angela grows to like Yoichi romantically but struggles on how to deal with her feelings because she is torn between them and her duty to the Tsubame Tenryu Ryouge. The first kanji in her family name means , in referenced to her watchful nature towards Tsubasa and the finger talons she uses as weapons.

Embi ""Envy"" Tsubame
The younger sister of Tsubasa.

Lucifelle ""Lucy"" Takatsukasa
Lucifelle is Angela's older sister and acts as Enbi's bodyguard. She is seen to respect Yoichi's martial arts skills and convinces Tsubasa to return to the Tsubame Benten Ryuu with Yoichi's help. In terms of skill, she is shown to be much stronger than Angela. Like Angela, Lucifelle is often seen wearing a cheongsam.

Saginomiya clan

Ukyo is the head of the Saginomiya clan and the head of the Heron's Temple, Azure Sky School. He has a crush on Ibuki (caused by various misunderstandings between him and Ibuki from when they first met as children) and originally attempted to kill Yoichi and later kidnap Ibuki. While he has become less obsessed that he used to be, his one-sided passion for Ibuki remains unabated, causing him to create a robot version of Ibuki, but he can also be very understanding; when Ibuki is defeated by Nuezume Aruko in Chapter 36 and loses both the Ikaruga dojo and her family, Ukyo trains with her to help her regain her self-confidence. He now has great respect for Yoichi (who defeated him in their first encounter) both as a warrior and as a person. After his defeat by Yoichi, He is followed and helped by his younger sister, Sakon.

Sakon Saginomiya

She faithfully follows her older brother around, and is very skilled in the arts of Disguise and ""her skills with herbs are top notch."" She disguised herself as a little old lady and later as Ayame, although her ""boobs were too big"" to make the latter disguise believable.

Coolstreak Comics' Leroy Douresseaux commends the manga by saying, ""While it offers plenty of cleavage and panty shots, Samurai Harem is more than just a fanservice manga. It’s also an energetic romantic comedy, made all the nicer by the fact that each of the four sisters has a distinct personality"". A later review by Douresseaux comments that the manga ""mostly avoids the martial aspects of having samurai and ninja populating a manga series.  So far, this series avoids the action, but does have plenty of comedy."" Comics Worth Reading's Ed Sizemore criticises the manga's ""focusing on the pubic region of girls and women"" and ""sound effect coming from the girl’s genitalia"" as ""shameless in its tastelessness"" as well as ""disturbing"". Pop Culture Shock's Ken Haley criticises the manga's art as ""bland"" but concedes the point that ""it does a good job at depicting scantily clad underage girls in compromising positions.""

The third DVD of Asu no Yoichi! was listed on the Oricon charts between May 18 and 24, 2009. THEM Anime Review's Tim Jones likens Yoichi and Ibuki with Tom and Jerry respectively from Tom and Jerry ""where Tom always lost against Jerry"". Jones compares Yoichi's love rival, Ryo Washizu, as ""a mishmash of Kuno and Ryoga from Ranma ½"". He's part Ryoga in that he wants to trump Yoichi even if it means training himself to the bone, and part Kuno in that he's an idiot when it comes to women (especially around Ibuki, who he constantly fantasizes of, as well as worries that she'll hate him for something inane that happens to him)."" Jones criticises the art with ""often drab, uncreative scenery, and the animation is only adequate save for a few fight sequences"". He also comments that ""the character designs are cute, but the Ikaruga sisters' hair and outfits (save Ayame's) look ridiculous."" He also criticises the background music as ""entirely forgettable"", and the ""opening & closing songs won't be staying in your head anytime soon"".

Known as ""the Visible Kirk"" because of its prominent position at the top of the hill within the historic village of Inveresk, it is a Category A listed building.

History 
There have been at least three churches on the site of the present church. The first was built beside the ruins of the Roman fort and is believed to have been a wooden structure which, according to legend, was built at the instigation of the Irish missionary nun Modwenna.

The second church was a medieval stone construction built sometime before 1547. Both Oliver Cromwell and Bonnie Prince Charlie commandeered the building during their respective campaigns. This building was also visited and preached in by James Wishart, who was accompanied by John Knox as part of the armed guard. By the end of the eighteenth century the size and condition of the medieval church were causing concern to the Kirk Session, so it was decided to build a new church ""to prevent the people from resorting to other places of worship"".

The third and present church was built in 1805 to the design of Robert Nisbet, with the steeple by William Sibbald. The interior of the church was reorientated and remodelled in 1895 to accommodate the Lewis pipe organ, which was donated by the Kirkwood family of Haddington. Further alterations were made to the church in 2002.

The church contains many stained glass windows, including the notable ""God in Creation, Providence and Redemption"" window, which was designed by Douglas Strachan and installed in 1923.

For four years from 1954, Mary Lusk, who, as the Rev Mary Levison, later became the first woman minister in the Church of Scotland, served as deaconess of the church.

In July 1999, the church raised over £100,000 from the sale of four 380-year old silver communion cups because it could no longer afford to store and insure them. The cups were made by craftsmen in Edinburgh and donated to the church by the Earl of Dunfermline. The money raised from the sale was used for roof repairs and mission work. One of the cups is now within the collection of the Huntly House Museum in Edinburgh.

Ministers 
The following have served as ministers of the church.

Graveyard 

The church is surrounded by a large graveyard that extends westwards for almost 300m and is split into separate walled sections, marking its various stages of extension. These sections can broadly be categorised as original (mainly 18th century), a late Victorian extension, an Edwardian/ early 20th century extension to the north, and a modern section to the far west.

The graveyard is owned and maintained by East Lothian Council.

Noteworthy graves 
The graveyard contains many noteworthy graves, including those of the following:

25,3031319,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS%20Carcassonne,AS Carcassonne,"Association Sportive of Carcassonne are a semi-professional rugby league football club based in Carcassonne in the region of Occitanie in the south of France. They play in the French Elite One Championship and are one of the most successful clubs in French rugby league, having won a total of eleven French rugby league championship titles and fourteen Lord Derby Cups.

The club was founded in 1938 and to date has produced debatably the best ever French Rugby league footballer in Puig Aubert. The club plays its home matches at the Stade Albert Domec.

The club runs both youth teams and a ladies' team.

History 

As early as 1899 rugby was introduced to the rich and well off in Carcassonne. The club reached the rugby championship final in 1925, then in 1930 along with 11 other clubs they broke away from the French rugby union and began their own competition. With the creation of the French rugby league championship in 1934 several rugby league clubs began springing up throughout the France. It was not until May 1938 though that AS Carcassonne would join. Their debut season saw them finish 3rd before losing in the semi-finals to US Villeneuve. The following season they reached the cup semi-final, but before it could be played war broke out and the season was ended.

The French Vichy government placed a ban on rugby league as of December 19, 1941.

After the war AS Carcassonne returned to rugby league under the direction of Paul Barriere. Several new players joined the club, most notably nineteen-year-old Puig Aubert; this influx of players would signal both new ambition and success for the  club who would go on to win five Championship titles over the next ten years coupled with four Lord Derby Cups.

With the completion of the golden years in early 1950s the club went through a somewhat lean period where silverware would evade them for several years until the early 1960s when the club would have a semi-return to their glory days winning back to back Lord Derby Cups and another four French Championships between 1966 and 1976.

Since the completion of the 1977 season the club's fortunes took something of a slide by their standards. The club managed only a single French Championship in 1992 and two Lord Derby Cups in 1983 and 1990. In seasons 1992–93 and 1993–94 they competed in the British cup competition the Regal Trophy losing in the opening round on both occasions firstly to Wigan 0-52, and then Carlisle 24-36 the following season. The new millennium didn't bring too much silverware either but having been runner up in the cup in 2004 and 2007 they lifted the trophy again in 2009. 2012 was a memorable campaign that ended with them completing a league and cup double beating Pia XIII in both finals. The reward for winning the title was a place in the British rugby league Challenge Cup in 2013, they lost 16–24 away at Workington Town. Runners up in 2014 v Toulouse Olympique in the cup and a year later they were runners up again this time in the league against the same opponents. Season 2016-17 saw them win the Lord Derby Cup for a record 14th time after beating Lezignan Sangliers 30–24.

AS Carcassonne v Australia

Colours and badge 

The crest for AS Carcassonne originated when the club decided to design itself a badge that was unique and represented the Carcassonne area. It was subsequently decided to have the city's main feature of the castle-like fortified city appear on the crest, a decision that has proven popular and remains until this day.

Stadium 

Stade Albert Domec originally called 'le stade de la Pepiniere' was built in 1899 the ground sits within the medieval castle walls. When the rugby club sold it to the local council in 1919 they set about work on the ground. Two new stands which are still in use were built, each holding 3,000 spectators, along with some floodlights. The ground is named after a former player of AS Carcassonne and a former French international. The grounds current capacity is 10,000 well below the record attendance OF 23,500 set on 22 May 1949 when it hosted the French rugby league championship Final between AS Carcassonne and Marseille XIII.

Notable players 
Puig Aubert: The most notable player to come from the Carcassonne club, Aubert captained both AS Carcassonne and the French national side to glory on many occasions throughout his illustrious career. Originally signed to the club in the 1944 season and would become a vital part of the club's glory years from 1945 to 1953 where the club would go on to win five Championships in nine years. After his professional retirement in the early-1960s Aubert would end up residing in Carcassonne where he eventually would pass away on June 3, 1994, of a heart attack. Later that year the club would honour Aubert with a statue at the ground that he played at for the majority of his career.

27,18722923,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirarpie%20Der%20Nersessian,Sirarpie Der Nersessian,"Sirarpie Der Nersessian (5 September 18965 July 1989) was an Armenian art historian, who specialized in Armenian and Byzantine studies. Der Nersessian was a renowned academic and a pioneer in Armenian art history. She taught at several institutions in the United States, including Wellesley College in Massachusetts and as Henri Focillon Professor of Art and Archaeology at Harvard University. She was a senior fellow at Dumbarton Oaks, its deputy director from 1954 to 1955 and 1961–62 and a member of its Board of Scholars. Der Nersessian was also a member of several international institutions such as the British Academy (1975), the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1978) and the Armenian Academy of Sciences (1966).

Biography

Education
Der Nersessian was born the youngest of three children in Constantinople in 1896. She came from a well-to-do family and her maternal uncle happened to be the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Malachia Ormanian. Her parents died while she was still young: her mother Akabi, when she was nine, and her father Mihran, when she was eighteen. She attended the Esayan Academy and the English Girls School in Constantinople, gaining fluency in Armenian, English and French at an early age. In 1915, during the height of the Armenian genocide, Der Nersessian and her sister Arax (by then orphans) were forced to leave for Europe, where they took up residence in Geneva. Der Nersessian studied at the University of Geneva for several years until settling in Paris, France in 1919.

Der Nersessian was admitted to Sorbonne University, studying history at the École des Hautes Études de l'université de Paris. She studied under the notable Byzantinologists Charles Diehl and Gabriel Millet and art historian Henri Focillon. In 1922, she became Millet's assistant, and with his help, published one of her first articles in 1929. The two theses (graduates students then had to submit two theses) that she presented for her doctorat d'etat, ""L'illustration du roman de Barlaam et Joasaph"" and a paper on Armenian illuminated manuscripts during the late medieval period, were well-received (earning a Mention très honorable), and both of them were awarded with prizes by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and Revue des Études Grecques when they were published in 1937.

Professor and pioneer
In 1930, Der Nersessian moved to the United States at the suggestion of her three mentors, Byzantinists Charles Rufus Morey, Albert M. Friend Jr., and Walter Cook, becoming a part-time lecturer at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She taught art history at Wellesley, quickly gaining a full professorship and later becoming the chairwoman of the Department of Art History and Director of Farnsworth Museum. Der Nersessian was the first woman to teach Byzantine art at a woman's college, the first woman to be decorated with the medal of Saint Gregory the Illuminator by Catholicos Vazgen I in 1960, the first woman invited to lecture at the Collège de France in Paris, the only woman in her time to gain full professorship at Dumbarton Oaks, and the second woman to be honored with a gold medal from the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1970. In 1947, she received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women.

Der Nersessian remained at Dumbarton Oaks until 1978, when she retired to France and lived with her sister in Paris. Upon retirement, she had her entire library shipped to the Matenadaran in Yerevan, so as to better help Armenian scholars in their studies. Shortly after her death in 1989, an endowment fund for prospective art history students in Armenia, Fonds Sirarpie Der Neressian at the Institut de Recherches sur les Miniatures Arméno-Byzantines, was created in her honor.

Bibliography
Der Nersessian's work primarily concerned Armenian art history, including the study of  church architecture, illuminated manuscripts, miniatures and sculpture. Below is a partial list of books and articles that she authored. Her 1945 book, Armenia and the Byzantine Empire, was praised by art historians David Talbot Rice, Jurgis Baltrušaitis, and Alexander Vasiliev. Vasiliev wrote in his review of the book that she is ""the best authority of our day on Armenian history, art, and civilization.""

It is sometimes called the Su-100.

Design and development

In 1963, the Soviet government held a request for proposal among the aircraft design bureaus, with the aim of developing an aircraft analogous to the North American XB-70 Valkyrie. The Sukhoi design, with its high cruise speed of  was favored over the designs submitted by Yakovlev and Tupolev and after a preliminary design review in June 1964, the building of a prototype was authorized.
Development of the T-4 required massive research efforts to develop the technologies necessary, including the manufacturing technologies to machine and weld the materials necessary to withstand sustained Mach 3 flight. Nearly 600 patents or inventions are attributed to the program.
The first flying prototype was finally completed in the autumn of 1971. Work continued on an additional three airframes (one for static testing) through 1975. In 1974, the Ministry of Aviation Industry ordered work suspended on the T-4 project, which was officially scrapped on 19 December 1975.

The aircraft's droop nose lowered to provide visibility during takeoff and landing. A periscope was used for forward viewing when the nose was retracted, and could be employed at speeds of up to . Drogue parachutes were used in addition to conventional wheel brakes.

Operational history
The first T-4, designated ""101"", first flew on 22August 1972. The test pilot was Vladimir Ilyushin, son of famed aircraft designer Sergei Ilyushin, and navigator Nikolai Alfyorov. Testing continued to 19January 1974. The T-4 flew only ten times for a total 10 hours and 20 minutes. It is believed to have reached at least Mach1.3 at an altitude of  using four Kolesov RD36-41 engines. These engines each produced  thrust with afterburners. The aircraft was designed to achieve speeds of up to Mach3.0 with nine tons of weapons (two MKB Raduga Kh-45 missiles) under the wings, but the program was cancelled before the full performance of the aircraft could be reached. .

Aircraft on display
One T-4 survives. Aircraft ""101"" is on display at the Central Air Force Museum in Monino near Moscow. The serial numbers of the prototypes were ""101"" to ""106"". Only ""101"" and ""102"" were built, while other additional prototypes ""103"" and ""104"" were under construction, and ""105"" and ""106"" only existed on draft charts. Only the ""101"" completed all the test flights and flew the last test flight before the project was canceled on 22 January 1974. The rest of the prototypes were scrapped.

33,54962189,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian%20coastal%20defense%20ship%20Deodoro,Brazilian coastal defense ship Deodoro,"Deodoro, also known as Marshal Deodoro, was a coastal defense ship built for the Brazilian Navy at the end of the nineteenth century. It was the lead ship of its class, alongside . Deodoro was one of several ships to rebel in the 1910 Revolt of the Lash, and it was used for neutrality patrols during the First World War. It was sold to Mexico in 1924, and broken up for scrap in 1938.

Service 
Deodoro was laid down by the French shipbuilding company Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in 1896, supervised by Admiral José Cândido Guillobel. Its construction was temporarily suspended by the Brazilians while they modified its design. It was launched on 18 June 1898, after a ceremony that was attended by representatives from Brazil, the French Navy, and a Russian gunboat. Its christening was accomplished with an electric button, which sent a signal to cut a cord and let a bottle of champagne break on the ship. At the beginning of the Spanish–American War (1898), officials from both participants traveled to France to inspect the incomplete Deodoro and sister ship Floriano in view of purchasing them for the conflict. Neither was close enough to completion to make such an acquisition worthwhile.

Deodoro was completed in 1900, and its trials were successful, including a 24-hour trial with a mean speed of . After the ship was handed over to Brazil, the ship left France en route for Brazil, stopping along the way in the Spanish Canary Islands. A nearby British warship, which was at that time engaged in the Second Boer War, suspected the ship of being a Boer-chartered privateer heading south to interfere with British merchant ships plying along the coast of southern Africa. Although the Brazilians were able to convince the British of their identity, they steamed with lights off for the next night or two in an effort to avoid further confusion with any other warships. Deodoro arrived in Brazil on 18 February 1900.

Deodoro saw its first action in 1904, when it shelled rebelling soldiers at the military school at . Six years later, its own crew rebelled as part of the Revolt of the Lash. The Brazilian Navy at the time was heavily segregated between white officers and a broadly black or mulatto enlisted sailors, and the former would often violently punish the latter for even minor transgressions. Tensions came to a head in November 1910, when sailors aboard the new dreadnought  rebelled, and the crews of Deodoro, another new dreadnought (), a new cruiser (), and several smaller vessels joined. The revolt ended peacefully, and the mutineers were granted an amnesty that was later cancelled.

In 1912, the Brazilian Navy overhauled Deodoro in Rio de Janeiro, fitting a new propulsion system and armament. In September and October 1913, the ship took part in a major naval exercise with the majority of the Brazilian fleet, which was observed by the country's president, naval minister, and other politicians.

During the First World War, the navy placed Deodoro in its northern squadron, which was responsible for neutrality patrols in the area between the states of Amazonas (located up the Amazon River) and Sergipe. Deodoro, the detachment's flagship, was joined in this task by Floriano, two cruisers, two destroyers, and the six vessels of Brazil's Amazon River flotilla.

On 19 April 1924, Brazil sold the ship to the Mexican Navy, where it was renamed Anáhuac. The Brazilians used the money gained (eight thousand contos) to purchase a submarine from Italy, . No further upgrades were made to Anáhuac in its remaining service life, and the Mexican Navy sold it for scrap in 1938.

34,18369222,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pas%20de%20Peyrol,Pas de Peyrol,"Pas de Peyrol (el. 1,589 m) is a mountain pass located in Auvergne, France, and is the highest road pass in the Massif Central. The pass is on the slopes of  Puy Mary (1,787 m) and is situated at the junction of three roads:

 D17 to the south-west towards Aurillac, via the Col de Redondet (1,531 m), then down the valley of the River Jordanne.
 D680 to the north-west towards Salers
 D680 to the east, towards Dienne, down the valley of the River Santoire

Tour de France
The pass is regularly used on the Tour de France, most recently in the 2020 tour. The pass was first used in the 1959 Tour de France, on the 231 km stage 14 from Aurillac to Clermont Ferrand, with Louis Bergaud first across the summit. In the 2004 tour, the pass was used on stage 10 from Limoges to Saint-Flour, approaching from the Salers direction which includes a final three kilometres at an average of 12% and a maximum gradient of 15%, with Richard Virenque first over the summit. The same ascent was used as the finish of stage 13 in the 2020 Tour de France, which was won by Daniel Martínez.

Appearances in the Tour de France  
The Tour de France has crossed or finished at the summit 11 times since 1947. The 10th stage of the 2004 tour was selected for the 2004 L'Étape du Tour, in which amateur and club riders ride over a full stage of the tour.

40,211484,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism,Populism,"Populism refers to a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of ""the people"" and often juxtapose this group against ""the elite."" The term developed in the late 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties and movements since that time, often as a pejorative. Within political science and other social sciences, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether. 

A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the ideational approach: this defines populism as an ideology which presents ""the people"" as a morally good force and contrasts them against ""the elite,"" who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how ""the people"" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present ""the elite"" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups—such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants—above the interests of ""the people."" Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as ""the voice of the people."" According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as nationalism, liberalism, or socialism. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the left–right political spectrum, and there exist both left-wing populism and right-wing populism.

Other scholars of the social sciences have defined the term populism differently. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, populism refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision making. An approach associated with the political scientist Ernesto Laclau presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant power structures. Some economists have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial public spending financed by foreign loans, resulting in hyperinflation and emergency measures. In popular discourse—where the term has often been used pejoratively—it has sometimes been used synonymously with demagogy, to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with opportunism, to characterise politicians who seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action.

In the 1960s the term became increasingly popular among social scientists in Western countries, and later in the 20th century it was applied to various political parties active in liberal democracies. In the 21st century, the struggle over the term intensified in political discourse, particularly in the Americas and Europe, with it being used to describe a range of left-wing, right-wing, and centrist groups that challenged the established parties.

Etymology and terminology

The word populism has been contested, mistranslated and used in reference to a diverse variety of movements and beliefs. The political scientist Will Brett characterised it as ""a classic example of a stretched concept, pulled out of shape by overuse and misuse"", while the political scientist Paul Taggart has said of populism that it is ""one of the most widely used but poorly understood political concepts of our time"".

The term originated as a form of self-designation, being used by members of the People's Party active in the United States during the late 19th century. In the Russian Empire during the same period, a completely different group referred to itself as the narodniki, which has often been mistranslated into English as populists, adding further confusion over the term. The Russian and American movements differed in various respects, and the fact that they shared a name was coincidental. In the 1920s, the term entered the French language, where it was used to describe a group of writers expressing sympathy for ordinary people.

Although the term began as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as ""populists"". As noted by the political scientist Margaret Canovan, ""there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings."" In this it differs from other political terms, like ""socialism"" or ""conservatism"", which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word. Instead it shares similarities with terms such as ""far left"", ""far right"", or ""extremist"", which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations.
 
In corporate-owned media, the term ""populism"" has often been conflated with other concepts like demagoguery, and generally presented as something to be ""feared and discredited"". It has often been applied to movements that are considered to be outside the political mainstream or a threat to democracy. The political scientists Yves Mény and Yves Surel noted that ""populism"" had become ""a catchword, particularly in the media, to designate the newborn political or social movements which challenge the entrenched values, rules and institutions of democratic orthodoxy."" Typically, the term is usually used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents. Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as ""populists"" in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations. The French far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that ""Populism precisely is taking into account the people's opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist.""  Similarly, on being founded in 2003, the centre-left Lithuanian Labour Party declared: ""we are and will be called populists.""

Following 2016, the year which saw the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States and the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union—both events linked to populism—the word populism became one of the most widely used terms by international political commentators. In 2017, the Cambridge Dictionary declared it the Word of the Year.

Use in academia

Until the 1950s, use of the term populism remained restricted largely to historians studying the People's Party, but in 1954 the US sociologist Edward Shils published an article proposing populism as a term to describe anti-elite trends in US society more broadly. Following on from Shils' article, during the 1960s the term ""populism"" became increasingly popular among sociologists and other academics in the social sciences. In 1967 a Conference on Populism was held at the London School of Economics, the participants of which failed to agree on a clear, single definition. As a result of this scholarly interest, an academic field known as ""populism studies"" emerged. Interest in the subject grew rapidly: between 1950 and 1960 about 160 publications on populism appeared, while between 1990 and 2000 that number was over 1500. From 2000–2015, about 95 papers and books including the term ""populism"" were catalogued each year by Web of Science. In 2016, it grew to 266; in 2017, it was 488, and in 2018, it was 615. Taggart argued that this academic interest was not consistent but appeared in ""bursts"" of research that reflected the political conditions of the time.

Canovan noted that ""if the notion of populism did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that"". From examining how the term ""populism"" had been used, she proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of ""agrarian populism""; these included farmers' radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism. The other four were forms of ""political populism"", representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians' populism. She noted that these were ""analytical constructs"" and that ""real-life examples may well overlap several categories"", adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories. In this way, Canovan conceived of populism as a family of related concepts rather than as a single concept in itself.

The confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship. In contrast to this view, the political scientists Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser stated that ""while the frustration is understandable, the term populism is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away with."" Similarly, Canovan noted that the term ""does have comparatively clear and definite meanings in a number of specialist areas"" and that it ""provides a pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience"". The political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell thought that ""if carefully defined, the term 'populism' can be used profitably to help us understand and explain a wide array of political actors"". The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that ""although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an ineliminable core: that is, that it refers to a distinct pattern of ideas."" Political scientist David Art argues that the concept of populism brings together disparate phenomena in an unhelpful manner, and ultimately obscures and legitimizes figures who are more comprehensively defined as nativists and authoritarians.

Although academic definitions of populism have differed, most of them have focused on the idea that it should reference some form of relationship between ""the people"" and ""the elite"", and that it entailed taking an anti-establishment stance. Beyond that, different scholars have emphasised different features that they wish to use to define populism. These differences have occurred both within specific scholarly disciplines and among different disciplines, varying for instance among scholars focusing on different regions and different historical periods.

Ideational definition

A common approach to defining populism is known as the ideational approach. This emphasises the notion that populism should be defined according to specific ideas which underlie it, as opposed to certain economic policies or leadership styles which populist politicians may display. In this definition, the term populism is applied to political groups and individuals who make appeals to ""the people"" and then contrast this group against ""the elite"".

Adopting this approach, Albertazzi and McDonnell define populism as an ideology that ""pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous 'others' who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice"". Similarly, the political scientist Carlos de la Torre defined populism as ""a Manichean discourse that divides politics and society as the struggle between two irreconcilable and antagonistic camps: the people and the oligarchy or the power block.""

In this understanding, note Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, ""populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people"", and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of ""an antagonistic relationship"" between ""the people"" and ""the elite"", and is ""latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy"". The political scientist Manuel Anselmi proposed that populism be defined as featuring a ""homogenous community-people"" which ""perceives itself as the absolute holder of popular sovereignty"" and ""expresses an anti-establishment attitude."" This understanding conceives of populism as a discourse, ideology, or worldview. These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.

According to this approach, populism is viewed as a ""thin ideology"" or ""thin-centred ideology"" which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for societal change. It thus differs from the ""thick-centred"" or ""full"" ideologies such as fascism, liberalism, and socialism, which provide more far-reaching ideas about social transformation. As a thin-centred ideology, populism is therefore attached to a thick-ideology by populist politicians. Thus, populism can be found merged with forms of nationalism, liberalism, socialism, federalism, or conservatism. According to Stanley, ""the thinness of populism ensures that in practice it is a complementary ideology: it does not so much overlap with as diffuse itself throughout full ideologies.""

Populism is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, ""a kind of mental map through which individuals analyse and comprehend political reality"".
Mudde noted that populism is ""moralistic rather than programmatic"". It encourages a binary world-view in which everyone is divided into ""friends and foes"", with the latter being regarded not just as people who have ""different priorities and values"" but as being fundamentally ""evil"". In emphasising one's purity against the corruption and immorality of ""the elite"", from which ""the people"" must remain pure and untouched, populism prevents compromise between different groups.

Right and left-wing

As a result of the various different ideologies with which populism can be paired, the forms that populism can take vary widely. Populism itself cannot be positioned on the left–right political spectrum, and both right and left-wing populisms exist. Populist movements can also mix divisions between left and right, for instance by combining xenophobic attitudes commonly associated with the far-right with redistributive economic policies closer to those of the left.

The ideologies with which populism can be paired can be contradictory, resulting in different forms of populism that can oppose each other. For instance, in Latin America during the 1990s, populism was often associated with politicians like Peru's Alberto Fujimori who promoted neoliberal economics, while in the 2000s it was instead associated with those like Venezuela's Hugo Chávez who promoted socialist programs. As well as populists of the left and right, populist figures like Italy's Beppe Grillo have been characterised as centrist and liberals, while groups like Turkey's Justice and Development Party have been described as combining populism with Islamism, and India's Bharatiya Janata Party has been seen as mixing populism with Hindu nationalism. Although populists of different ideological traditions can oppose each other, they can also form coalitions, as was seen in the Greek coalition government which brought together the left-wing populist Syriza and the right-wing populist Independent Greeks in 2015.

Adherents of the ideational definition have also drawn a distinction between left and right-wing populists. The latter are presented as juxtaposing ""the people"" against both ""the elite"" and an additional group who are also regarded as being separate from ""the people"" and whom ""the elite"" is seen to favour, such as immigrants, homosexuals, travellers, or communists.
Populist leaders thus ""come in many different shades and sizes"" but, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, share one common element: ""a carefully crafted image of the vox populi"". Stanley expressed the view that although there are ""certain family resemblances"" that can be seen between populist groups and individuals, there was ""no coherent tradition"" unifying all of them.
While many left-wing parties in the early 20th century presented themselves as the vanguard of the proletariat, by the early 21st century left-wing populists were presenting themselves as the ""voice of the people"" more widely. On the political right, populism is often combined with nationalism, with ""the people"" and ""the nation"" becoming fairly interchangeable categories in their discourse.
Some political scientists have also argued that populism can be divided into ""inclusionary"" and ""exclusionary"" forms.

""The people""

For populists, ""the people"" are presented as being homogeneous, and also virtuous. In simplifying the complexities of reality, the concept of ""the people"" is vague and flexible, with this plasticity benefitting populists who are thus able to ""expand or contract"" the concept ""to suit the chosen criteria of inclusion or exclusion"" at any given time. In employing the concept of ""the people"", populists can encourage a sense of shared identity among different groups within a society and facilitate their mobilisation toward a common cause. One of the ways that populists employ the understanding of ""the people"" is in the idea that ""the people are sovereign"", that in a democratic state governmental decisions should rest with the population and that if they are ignored then they might mobilise or revolt. This is the sense of ""the people"" employed in the late 19th century United States by the People's Party and which has also been used by later populist movements in that country.

A second way in which ""the people"" is conceived by populists combines a socioeconomic or class based category with one that refers to certain cultural traditions and popular values. The concept seeks to vindicate the dignity of a social group who regard themselves as being oppressed by a dominant ""elite"" who are accused of treating ""the people's"" values, judgements, and tastes with suspicion or contempt. A third use of ""the people"" by populists employs it as a synonym for ""the nation"", whether that national community be conceived in either ethnic or civic terms. In such a framework, all individuals regarded as being ""native"" to a particular state, either by birth or by ethnicity, could be considered part of ""the people"".

Populism typically entails ""celebrating them  the people"", in Stanley's words.
The political scientist Paul Taggart proposed the term ""the heartland"" to better reflect what populists often mean in their rhetoric. According to Taggart, ""the heartland"" was the place ""in which, in the populist imagination, a virtuous and unified population resides"". Who this ""heartland"" is can vary between populists, even within the same country. For instance, in Britain, the centre-right Conservative Party conceived of ""Middle England"" as its heartland, while the far-right British National Party conceived of the ""native British people"" as its heartland.
Mudde noted that for populists, ""the people"" ""are neither real nor all-inclusive, but are in fact a mythical and constructed sub-set of the whole population"". They are an imagined community, much like the imagined communities embraced and promoted by nationalists.

Populism often entails presenting ""the people"" as the underdog. Populists typically seek to reveal to ""the people"" how they are oppressed. In doing so, they do not seek to change ""the people"", but rather seek to preserve the latter's ""way of life"" as it presently exists, regarding it as a source of good. For populists, the way of life of ""the people"" is presented as being rooted in history and tradition and regarded as being conducive to public good.  Although populist leaders often present themselves as representatives of ""the people"", they often come from elite strata in society; examples like Berlusconi, Fortuyn, and Haider were all well-connected to their country's political and economic elites.

Populism can also be subdivided into ""inclusionary"" and ""exclusionary"" forms, which differ in their conceptions of who ""the people"" are. Inclusionary populism tends to define ""the people"" more broadly, accepting and advocating for minority and marginalised groups, while exclusionary populism defines ""the people"" in a much stricter sense, generally being focused on a particular sociocultural group and antagonistic against minority groups. However, this is not exactly a pure dichotomy – exclusive populists can still give voice to those who feel marginalised by the political status quo and include minorities if it is advantageous, while inclusive populists can vary significantly in how inclusive they actually are. In addition, all populisms are implicitly exclusionary, since they define ""the people"" against ""the elite"", thus some scholars argue that the difference between populisms is not whether a particular populism excludes but whom it excludes from its conception of ""the people"".

""The elite""

Anti-elitism is widely considered the central characteristic feature of populism, although Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that anti-elitism alone was not evidence of populism. Rather, according to Stanley, in populist discourse the ""fundamental distinguishing feature"" of ""the elite"" is that it is in an ""adversarial relationship"" with ""the people"". In defining ""the elite"", populists often condemn not only the political establishment, but also the economic elite, cultural elite, academic elite, and the media elite, which they present as one homogeneous, corrupt group. In early 21st century India, the populist Bharatiya Janata Party for instance accused the dominant Indian National Congress party, the Communist Party of India, NGOs, academia, and the English-language media of all being part of ""the elite"".

When operating in liberal democracies, populists often condemn dominant political parties as part of ""the elite"" but at the same time do not reject the party political system altogether, instead either calling for or claiming to be a new kind of party different from the others. Although condemning almost all those in positions of power within a given society, populists often exclude both themselves and those sympathetic to their cause even when they too are in positions of power. For instance, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), a right-wing populist group, regularly condemned ""the media"" in Austria for defending ""the elite"", but excluded from that the Kronen Zeitung, a widely read tabloid that supported the FPÖ and its leader Jörg Haider.

When populists take governmental power, they are faced with a challenge in that they now represent a new elite. In such cases—like Chávez in Venezuela and Vladimír Mečiar in Slovakia—populists retain their anti-establishment rhetoric by making changes to their concept of ""the elite"" to suit their new circumstances, alleging that real power is not held by the government but other powerful forces who continue to undermine the populist government and the will of ""the people"" itself. In these instances, populist governments often conceptualise ""the elite"" as those holding economic power. In Venezuela, for example, Chávez blamed the economic elite for frustrating his reforms, while in Greece, the left-wing populist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras accused ""the lobbyists and oligarchs of Greece"" of undermining his administration. In populist instances like these, the claims made have some basis in reality, as business interests seek to undermine leftist-oriented economic reform.

Although left-wing populists who combine populist ideas with forms of socialism most commonly present ""the elite"" in economic terms, the same strategy is also employed by some right-wing populists. In the United States during the late 2000s, the Tea Party movement—which presented itself as a defender of the capitalist free market—argued that big business, and its allies in Congress, seeks to undermine the free market and kill competition by stifling small business. Among some 21st century right-wing populists, ""the elite"" are presented as being left-wing radicals committed to political correctness. The Dutch right-wing populist leader Pim Fortuyn referred to this as the ""Church of the Left"".

In some instances, particularly in Latin America and Africa, ""the elites"" are conceived not just in economic but also in ethnic terms, representing what political scientists have termed ethnopopulism. In Bolivia, for example, the left-wing populist leader Evo Morales juxtaposed the mestizo and indigenous ""people"" against an overwhelmingly European ""elite"", declaring that ""We Indians [i.e. indigenous people] are Latin America's moral reserve"". In the Bolivian case, this was not accompanied by a racially exclusionary approach, but with an attempt to build a pan-ethnic coalition which included European Bolivians against the largely European Bolivian elite. In South Africa, the populist Julius Malema has presented black South Africans as the ""people"" whom he claims to represent, calling for the expropriation of land owned by the white minority without compensation. In areas like Europe where nation-states are more ethnically homogenous, this ethnopopulist approach is rare given that the ""people"" and ""elite"" are typically of the same ethnicity.

For some populist leaders and movements, the term ""the elite"" also refers to an academic or intellectual establishment and, as such, entails scholars, intellectuals, experts, or organized science as a whole. Such leaders and movements may criticise scientific knowledge as abstract, useless, and ideologically biased, and instead demand common sense, experiential knowledge, and practical solutions to be ""true knowledge"". Examples of such a ""science-related populism"" are British Conservative Party politician Michael Gove suggesting that the British people ""have had enough of experts"" or US entrepreneur Peter Thiel praising common sense as an ""incredible indictment of our elites"".

In various instances, populists claim that ""the elite"" is working against the interests of the country. In the European Union (EU), for instance, various populist groups allege that their national political elites put the interests of the EU itself over those of their own nation-states. Similarly, in Latin America populists often charge political elites with championing the interests of the United States over those of their own countries.

Another common tactic among populists, particularly in Europe, is the accusation that ""the elites"" place the interests of immigrants above those of the native population. The Zambian populist Michael Sata for instance adopted a xenophobic stance during his campaigns by focusing his criticism on the country's Asian minority, decrying Chinese and Indian ownership of businesses and mines. In India, the right-wing populist leader Narendra Modi rallied supporters against Muslim Bangladeshi migrants, promising to deport them. In instances where populists are also antisemitic (such as Jobbik in Hungary and Attack in Bulgaria) the elites are accused of favouring Israeli and wider Jewish interests above those of the national group.  Antisemitic populists often accuse ""the elite"" of being made up of many Jews as well. When populists emphasise ethnicity as part of their discourse, ""the elite"" can sometimes be presented as ""ethnic traitors"".

General will

A third component of the ideational approach to populism is the idea of the general will, or volonté générale. An example of this populist understanding of the general will can be seen in Chávez's 2007 inaugural address, when he stated that ""All individuals are subject to error and seduction, but not the people, which possesses to an eminent degree of consciousness of its own good and the measure of its independence. Because of that its judgement is pure, its will is strong, and none can corrupt or even threaten it."" For populists, the general will of ""the people"" is something that should take precedence over the preferences of ""the elite"".

As noted by Stanley, the populist idea of the general will is connected to ideas of majoritarianism and authenticity. Highlighting how populists appeal to the ideals of ""authenticity and ordinariness"", he noted that what was most important to populists was ""to appeal to the  of an authentic people"" and to cultivate the idea that they are the ""genuine"" representatives of ""the people"". In doing so they often emphasise their physical proximity to ""the people"" and their distance from ""the elites"".
Sheri Berman notes that while populists often engage in democratic rhetoric, they frequently ignore or devalue norms of liberal democracy such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, legitimate opposition, separation of powers and constraints on presidential power.

In emphasising the general will, many populists share the critique of representative democratic government previously espoused by the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. This approach regards representative governance as an aristocratic and elitist system in which a country's citizens are regarded as passive entities. Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilised for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance. Populists often favour the use of direct democratic measures such as referendums and plebiscites. For this reason, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that ""it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy"", although Stanley cautioned that ""support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism.""  Populist notions of the ""general will"" and its links with populist leaders are usually based on the idea of ""common sense"".

Versus elitism and pluralism

Stanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to ""the people"" had become ""an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice"", with elections and referendums predicated on the notion that ""the people"" decide the outcome. Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements. Responding to this critique, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that the ideational definition did allow for a ""non-populism"" in the form of both elitism and pluralism.

Elitists share the populist binary division but reverse the associations. Whereas populists regard the elites as bad and the common people as good, elitists view ""the people"" as being vulgar, immoral, and dangerous and ""the elites"" as being morally, culturally, and intellectually superior. Elitists want politics to be largely or entirely an elite affair; some—such as Spain's Francisco Franco and Chile's Augusto Pinochet—reject democracy altogether, while others—like Spain's José Ortega y Gasset and Austria's Joseph Schumpeter—support a limited model of democracy.

Pluralism differs from both elitism and populism by rejecting any dualist framework, instead viewing society as a broad array of overlapping social groups, each with their own ideas and interests. Pluralists argue that political power should not be held by any single group—whether defined by their gender, ethnicity, economic status, or political party membership—and should instead be distributed. Pluralists encourage governance through compromise and consensus in order to reflect the interests of as many of these groups as possible. Unlike populists, pluralists do not believe that such a thing as a ""general will"" exists. Some politicians do not seek to demonise a social elite; for many conservatives for example, the social elite are regarded as the bulwark of the traditional social order, while for some liberals, the social elite are perceived as an enlightened legislative and administrative cadre.

Other definitions

The popular agency definition to populism uses the term in reference to a democratic way of life that is built on the popular engagement of the population in political activity. In this understanding, populism is usually perceived as a positive factor in the mobilisation of the populace to develop a communitarian form of democracy. This approach to the term is common among historians in the United States and those who have studied the late 19th century People's Party.

The Laclauan definition of populism, so called after the Argentinian political theorist Ernesto Laclau who developed it, uses the term in reference to what proponents regard as an emancipatory force that is the essence of politics. In this concept of populism, it is believed to mobilise excluded sectors of society against dominant elites and changing the status quo. Laclau's initial emphasis was on class antagonisms arising between different classes, although he later altered his perspective to claim that populist discourses could arise from any part of the socio-institutional structure. For Laclau, socialism was ""the highest form of populism"". His understandings of the topic derived in large part from his focus on politics in Latin America. This definition is popular among critics of liberal democracy and is widely used in critical studies and in studies of West European and Latin American politics. Harry C. Boyte for example defined populism as ""a politics of civic agency"" which ""develops the power of 'the people' to shape their destiny"", as examples citing both the Russian narodniks and the South African Black Consciousness Movement.

The socioeconomic definition of populism applies the term to what it regards as an irresponsible form of economic policy by which a government engages in a period of massive public spending financed by foreign loans, after which the country falls into hyperinflation and harsh economic adjustments are then imposed. This use of the term was used by economists like Rudiger Dornbusch and Jeffrey Sachs and was particularly popular among scholars of Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s. Since that time, this definition continued to be used by some economists and journalists, particularly in the US, but was uncommon among other social sciences. This definition relies on focusing on socialist and other left-wing forms of populism; it does not apply to other groups commonly understood as populist which adopted right-wing stances on economic issues.

An additional framework has been described as the ""political-strategic"" approach. This applies the term populism to a political strategy in which a charismatic leader seeks to govern based on direct and unmediated connection with their followers. Kurt Weyland defined this conception of populism as ""a political strategy through which a personalist leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct, unmediated, uninstitutionalized support from large numbers of mostly unorganized followers"". This is a definition of the term that is popular among scholars of non-Western societies. By focusing on leadership, this concept of populism does not allow for the existence of populist parties or populist social movements; under this definition, for instance, the US People's Party which first invented the term populism could not be considered populist. Mudde suggested that although the idea of a leader having direct access to ""the people"" was a common element among populists, it is best regarded as a feature which facilitates rather than defines populism.

In popular discourse, populism is sometimes used in a negative sense in reference to politics which involves promoting extremely simple solutions to complex problems in a highly emotional manner. Mudde suggested that this definition ""seems to have instinctive value"" but was difficult to employ empirically because almost all political groups engage in sloganeering and because it can be difficult to differentiate an argument made emotionally from one made rationally. Mudde thought that this phenomenon was better termed demagogy rather than populism. Another use of the term in popular discourse is to describe opportunistic policies designed to quickly please voters rather than deciding a more rational course of action. Examples of this would include a governing political party lowering taxes before an election or promising to provide things to the electorate which the state cannot afford to pay for. Mudde suggested that this phenomenon is better described as opportunism rather than populism.

Demand-side factors 
One area of debate in explaining populism is whether its main cause is based in the needs of citizens (demand-side explanations)  or in the failures of governments (supply-side explanations).  In focusing on the changing grievances or demands of citizens, demand-side explanations can be seen as bottom-up explanations, while supply-side explanations, in focusing on political actors and institutions, can be seen as top-down explanations.  Various demand-side factors have been claimed to make it more likely that individuals will support populist ideas. Economists and political economists often emphasize the importance of economic concerns while political scientists and sociologists often emphasize sociocultural concerns in their analysis of demand-side factors.

Economic grievance 
The economic grievance thesis argues that economic factors, such as deindustrialisation, economic liberalisation, and deregulation, are causing the formation of a 'left-behind' precariat with low job security, high inequality, and wage stagnation, who then support populism. Some theories only focus on the effect of economic crises, or inequality.

The evidence of increasing economic disparity and volatility of family incomes is clear, particularly in the United States, as shown by the work of Thomas Piketty and others.  Commentators such as Martin Wolf emphasize the importance of economics.  They warn that such trends increase  resentment and make people susceptible to populist rhetoric. Evidence for this is mixed.  At the macro level, political scientists report that xenophobia, anti-immigrant feeling, and resentment towards out-groups tend to be higher during difficult economic times. Economic crises have been associated with gains by right-wing political parties. However, there is little evidence at the micro- or individual level to link individual economic grievances and populist support.

Modernisation 
The modernisation losers theory argues that certain aspects of transition to modernity have caused demand for populism. Some arguments rely on the belief that anomie has followed industrialisation and resulted in ""dissolution, fragmentation and differentiation"", weakening the traditional ties of civil society, and increasing individualization.  Populism offers a broad identity which gives sovereignty to the previously marginalized masses as ""the people"". However, empirical studies suggest that supporters of radical right-wing populism occur across the social spectrum, and are not more likely to appear in groups defined as ""modernisation losers"".

Cultural backlash 
Other theories argue that grievances have a primarily sociocultural rather than an economic basis.  For example, the cultural backlash thesis argues that right-wing populism is reaction to the rise of postmaterialism in many developed countries, including the spread of feminism, multiculturalism, and environmentalism. According to this view, the spread of ideas and values through a society challenges accepted norms until society reaches a 'tipping point', which causes a reaction, in this case support for right-wing populism. Some theories limit this argument to being a reaction to just the increase of ethnic diversity from immigration. Such theories are particularly popular with sociologists and with political scientists studying industrial world and American politics. 

The empiric studies testing this theory have produced highly contradicting results. 
At the micro- or individual level, there are strong connections between individual positions on sociocultural issues (such as immigration policy and ""racial animus"") and right-wing populist voting. However, at the macro level, studies have not shown clear relationships between measures of populist sentiment in countries and actual right-wing party support. 

However, there is strong evidence from  political scientists and political psychologists documenting the influence of group-based identity threats on voters. Those who identify as part of a group and perceive it as being under threat are likely to support political actors who promise to protect the status and identity of their group. While such research often focuses on white identity, results apply broadly to other social groups that perceive themselves to be under threat.

Recent democratization 
The length of time since a country has been democratized has also been linked to its potential for populist success. This is claimed to be because younger democracies have less established political parties and weaker liberal democratic norms. For example, populist success in Eastern Europe has been linked to the legacy of communism. However, this explanation suffers from the lack of success of populism in most post-communist countries.

Supply-side factors 
Supply-side explanations focus on political actors and institutions and the ways in which governments may fail to respond to the changing conditions that affect citizens.  Economic, social, and other structural trends are seen as being modified by institutions as they determine political outcomes. In this view, citizens turn to populism when governments do not respond effectively to the challenges they and their citizens face. Research supports the idea that populism is more likely to thrive when mainstream parties on the center-left and center-right do not address important contemporary issues and do not offer clear alternatives to voters. Coalitions that blur distinctions on positions are also likely to increase populism.

In Political Order in Changing Societies (1968), Samuel P. Huntington argues that rapid change (social or economic) in a society will increase the demands of its citizens.  Unless political institutions are responsive and effective, they are unlikely to respond to and satisfy such demands. If political systems are weak or have become unresponsive over time, then dissatisfaction, political disorder and even violence become more likely.  Political institutions that do not respond to social and economic changes are likely to fail.  Responsive political systems can adapt to more severe challenges than unresponsive ones.  Huntington's ideas grew out of work on Third World countries, but are also applicable to  advanced industrial countries.

In a supply-side view of American politics, populism can be seen as a symptom of institutional decay.  It can be suggested that political factors such as gerrymandering, the Electoral College, special-interest lobbying and dark money, are distorting political and economic debate, and decreasing the ability of the government to respond to the concerns of large numbers of citizens. This in turn generates dissatisfaction, which may increase the likelihood that citizens will support populism. Scholars studying the European Union have suggested that European integration may have had the undesired effect of decreasing the system's responsiveness to  voters, as law and policy-making increasingly became the responsibility of the European Union. This too may have increased support for populism.  Institutions such as the European Central Bank may also distance decision-making from electoral power. It has been argued that political parties themselves have become  disconnected from society, and unable to respond to citizen's concerns.

Voluntarism  
Another underlying debate in discussions of populism is the comparison of structural and voluntarist approaches. Voluntarist or agency-based explanations focus on the behaviors of politicians and parties, including populists themselves.

An important area of research is the examination of how parties develop, and how responses to new parties shape them.  Successful politicians and parties shape the formation of agendas, identifying and increasing the salience of issues which they believe will benefit them.

Established parties may adopt various strategies when a new party appears: dismissive, adversarial, or accommodative. 
A dismissive strategy such as ignoring a party and its issue(s) can only be effective if the issue involved is unimportant or short-lived. Otherwise, dismissing an issue leaves ownership of the issue with the new party and allows them to attract any voters who see the issue as important.
In an adversarial response, a mainstream party directly engages over an issue, emphasizing their opposition to the new party's position.  This increases the issue's visibility, makes it a focus of ongoing political debate, and can reinforce the new party's ownership of it. An adversarial response can be to the benefit of a mainstream party if most voters (or at least the mainstream party's voters) disagree with the new party's position and are unlikely to ally with it as a result.
Finally, an accommodative strategy is to move the mainstream party closer to the position advocated by the new party, in hopes of retaining voters who care about the issue. This works best if adopted early, before a new party is heavily identified with an issue. If an issue is important, long-lived and of strong interest to its supporters, a mainstream party can benefit from quickly shifting its position to one closer to the new party.

Similarly, a populist party with neo-fascist or antidemocratic roots may be able to increase its support by moderating its views to a milder form of its original position (e.g. from neofascist to xenophobic.) Right-wing populists are more effective in mobilizing voters around issues when mainstream parties ignore the issue or offer alternatives that are not aligned with voter opinions.  They are also more likely to benefit from emphasizing social and cultural issues such as immigration and race, appealing to voters who are positioned economically towards the left-wing but hold socially conservative views.

Mobilisation

There are three forms of political mobilisation which populists have adopted: that of the populist leader, the populist political party, and the populist social movement. The reasons why voters are attracted to populists differ, but common catalysts for the rise of populists include dramatic economic decline or a systematic corruption scandal that damages established political parties. For instance, the Great Recession of 2007 and its impact on the economies of southern Europe was a catalyst for the rise of Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain, while the Mani pulite corruption scandal of the early 1990s played a significant part in the rise of the Italian populist Silvio Berlusconi. Another catalyst for the growth of populism is a widespread perception among voters that the political system is unresponsive to them. This can arise when elected governments introduce policies that are unpopular with their voters but which are implemented because they are considered to be ""responsible"" or imposed by supranational organisations; in Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank while in Europe, many countries in the European Union were pushed to implement unpopular economic austerity measures by the union's authorities. Decentralisation of political power is a very useful tool for populists to use to their benefit, this is because it allows them to speak more directly to the people which they seek to gain the attention and votes of.

Leaders

Populism is often associated with charismatic and dominant leaders, and the populist leader is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, ""the quintessential form of populist mobilization"". These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal. Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader. For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with ""the people"", and in many cases they claim to be a personification of ""the people"" themselves, presenting themselves as the vox populi or ""voice of the people"". Chavez for instance stated: ""I demand absolute loyalty to me. I am not an individual, I am the people."" Populist leaders can also present themselves as the saviour of the people because of their perceived unique talents and vision, and in doing so can claim to be making personal sacrifices for the good of the people. Because loyalty to the populist leader is thus seen as representing loyalty to the people, those who oppose the leader can be branded ""enemies of the people"".

The overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men, although there have been various females occupying this role. Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; Eva Perón was the wife of Juan Perón, Marine Le Pen the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, Keiko Fujimori the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, and Yingluck Shinawatra the sister of Thaksin Shinawatra.

Rhetorical styles

Canovan noted that populists often used ""colourful and undiplomatic language"" to distinguish themselves from the governing elite. In Africa, several populist leaders have distinguished themselves by speaking in indigenous languages rather than either French or English. Populist leaders often present themselves as people of action rather than people of words, talking of the need for ""bold action"" and ""common sense solutions"" to issues which they call ""crises"". Male populist leaders often express themselves using simple and sometimes vulgar language in an attempt to present themselves as ""the common man"" or ""one of the boys"" to add to their populist appeal.

An example of this is Umberto Bossi, the leader of the right-wing populist Italian Lega Nord, who at rallies would state ""the League has a hard-on"" while putting his middle-finger up as a sign of disrespect to the government in Rome. Another recurring feature of male populist leaders is the emphasis that they place on their own virility. An example of this is the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who bragged about his bunga bunga sex parties and his ability to seduce young women. Among female populist leaders, it is more common for them to emphasise their role as a wife and mother. The US right-wing populist Sarah Palin for instance referred to herself as a ""hockey mom"" and a ""mama grizzly"", while Australian right-wing populist Pauline Hanson stated that ""I care so passionately about this country, it's like I'm its mother. Australia is my home and the Australian people are my children.""

Populist leaders typically portray themselves as outsiders who are separate from the ""elite"". Female populist leaders sometimes reference their gender as setting them apart from the dominant ""old boys' club"", while in Latin America a number of populists, such as Evo Morales and Alberto Fujimori, emphasised their non-white ethnic background to set them apart from the white-dominated elite. Other populists have used clothing to set them apart. In South Africa, the populist Julius Malema and members of his Economic Freedom Fighters attended parliament dressed as miners and workers to distinguish themselves from the other politicians wearing suits. In instances where wealthy business figures promote populist sentiments, such as Ross Perot, Thaksin Shinawatra, or Berlusconi, it can be difficult to present themselves as being outside the elite, however this is achieved by portraying themselves as being apart from the political, if not the economic elite, and portraying themselves as reluctant politicians.
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that ""in reality, most populist leaders are very much part of the national elite"", typically being highly educated, upper-middle class, middle-aged males from the majority ethnicity.

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that ""true outsiders"" to the political system are rare, although cited instances like Venezuela's Chávez and Peru's Fujimori. More common is that they are ""insider-outsiders"", strongly connected to the inner circles of government but not having ever been part of it. The Dutch right-wing populist Geert Wilders had for example been a prominent back-bench MP for many years before launching his populist Party for Freedom, while in South Africa, Malema had been leader of the governing African National Congress (ANC) youth league until he was expelled, at which he launched his own populist movement. Only a few populist leaders are ""insiders"", individuals who have held leading roles in government prior to portraying themselves as populists. One example is Thaksin Shinawatra, who was twice deputy prime minister of Thailand before launching his own populist political party; another is Rafael Correa, who served as the Ecuadorean finance minister before launching a left-wing populist challenge.

Populist leaders are sometimes also characterised as strongmen or—in Latin American countries—as caudillos. In a number of cases, such as Argentina's Perón or Venezuela's Chávez, these leaders have military backgrounds which contribute to their strongman image.
Other populist leaders have also evoked the strongman image without having a military background; these include Italy's Berlusconi, Slovakia's Mečiar, and Thailand's Thaksin Shinawatra.
Populism and strongmen are not intrinsically connected, however; as stressed by Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, ""only a minority of strongmen are populists and only a minority of populists is a strongman"". Rather than being populists, many strongmen—such as Spain's Francisco Franco—were elitists who led authoritarian administrations.

In most cases, these populist leaders built a political organisation around themselves, typically a political party, although in many instances these remain dominated by the leader. These individuals often give a populist movement its political identity, as is seen with movements like Fortuynism in the Netherlands, Peronism in Argentina, Berlusconism in Italy and Chavismo in Venezuela. Populist mobilisation is not however always linked to a charismatic leadership. Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that populist personalist leadership was more common in countries with a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one because these allow for the election of a single individual to the role of head of government without the need for an accompanying party. Examples where a populist leader has been elected to the presidency without an accompanying political party have included Peron in Argentina, Fujimori in Peru, and Correa in Ecuador.

Media 

A subset of populism which deals with the use of media by politicians is called ""media populism"".

Populist leaders often use the media in order to mobilize their support. In Latin America, there is a long tradition of using mass media as a way for charismatic leaders to directly communicate with the poorly educated masses, first by radio and then by television. The former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had a weekly show called Aló Presidente, which according to historian Enrique Krauze gave some Venezuelans ""at least the appearance of contact with power, through his verbal and visual presence, which may be welcomed by people who have spent most of their lives being ignored.""

The media has also been argued to have helped populists in countries of other regions by giving exposure to the most controversial politicians for commercial reasons. Donald Trump was claimed to have received $5 billion worth of free coverage during his 2016 campaign. Tabloids are often stereotyped as presenting a platform for populist politics due to their tendency toward melodrama, infotainment, and conflict, and thus provide support for populist parties. Examples of this have been the support given by Kronen Zeitung to the Austrian Freedom Party and the Berlusconi-owned presses' support for Italy's National Alliance in the mid-1990s. Based on his analysis of Dutch and British media, Tjitske Akkerman however argued that tabloids were no more prone to populism than the quality press.

In the 21st century, populists have increasingly used social media to bypass the mainstream media and directly approach their target audiences. In earlier periods, before radio, thought ""mass media"" newspapers tended to operate more like social media than modern newspapers, publishing local gossip and with little fact-checking; the expansion of newspapers to rural areas of the United States in the early tweenith century increased support for populist partied and positions. It has been claimed that while traditional media, acting as so-called ‘gatekeepers’, filter the messages that they broadcast through journalistic norms, social media permits a ‘direct linkage’ from political actors to potential audiences. It has been claimed that the use of Twitter helped Donald Trump win the US presidency, while the same has been claimed regarding the use of YouTube by the Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign.

Presidential systems 
Populist leaders have been claimed to be more successful in presidential systems. This is because such systems give advantage to charismatic populist leaders, especially when institutionalized parties are weak. This is especially the case in two-round systems, because outsiders who might not win most votes in the first round of voting might be able to so when faced against a mainstream candidate in the second round. This has been claimed to be evident in the 1990 Peruvian general election won by Alberto Fujimori, who lost on the first round. Furthermore, Juan José Linz has argued that the direct relationship between the president and the electorate fosters a populist perception of the president as representing the whole people and their opponents as resisting the popular will.

Political parties

Another form of mobilisation is through populist political parties.
Populists are not generally opposed to political representation, but merely want their own representatives, those of ""the people"", in power. In various cases, non-populist political parties have transitioned into populist ones; the elitist Socialist Unity Party of Germany, a Marxist–Leninist group which governed East Germany, later transitioned after German re-unification into a populist party, The Left. In other instances, such as the Austrian FPÖ and Swiss SVP, a non-populist party can have a populist faction which later takes control of the whole party.

In some examples where a political party has been dominated by a single charismatic leader, the latter's death has served to unite and strengthen the party, as with Argentina's Justicialist Party after Juan Perón's death in 1974, or the United Socialist Party of Venezuela after Chávez's death in 2013. In other cases, a populist party has seen one strong centralising leader replace another, as when Marine Le Pen replaced her father Jean-Marie as the leader of the National Front in 2011, or when Heinz-Christian Strache took over from Haider as chair of the Freedom Party of Austria in 2005.

Many populist parties achieve an electoral breakthrough but then fail to gain electoral persistence, with their success fading away at subsequent elections. In various cases, they are able to secure regional strongholds of support but with little support elsewhere in the country; the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in Carinthia. Similarly, the Belgian Vlaams Belang party has its stronghold in Antwerp, while the Swiss People's Party has its stronghold in Zurich.

Social movements

An additional form is that of the populist social movement. Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most social movements focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with ""the people"" more broadly. However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the Occupy movement, which originated in the US and used the slogan ""We are the 99%"", and the Spanish Indignados movement, which employed the motto: ""real democracy now – we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers"".

Few populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth. In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics. An example of this can be seen with the India Against Corruption social movement, from which emerged Arvind Kejriwal, who founded the Aam Aadmi Party (""Common Man Party""). Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the Podemos party led by Pablo Iglesias Turrión. These populist social movements can exert a broader societal impact which results in populist politicians emerging to prominence; the Tea Party and Occupy movements that appeared in the US during the late 2000s and early 2010s have been seen as an influence on the rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as prominent figures in the mid-2010s.

Some populist leaders have sought to broaden their support by creating supporter groups within the country. Chavez, for instance, ordered the formation of Bolivarian Circles, Communal Councils, Urban Land Committees, and Technical Water Roundtables across Venezuela. These could improve political participation among poorer sectors of Venezuelan society, although also served as networks through which the state transferred resources to those neighbourhoods which produced high rates of support for Chavez government.

Other themes

Democracy

Populism is a flexible term as it can be seen to exist in both democracies as well as authoritarian regimes. There have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy. Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only ""true"" form of democracy. Populists often present themselves as ""true democrats"". It could be argued that populism is democratic as it allows voters to remove governments they don’t approve via the ballot box because voting is an essential value for a state to be considered a democracy. Albertazzi and McDonnell stated that populism and democracy were ""inextricably linked"", the political scientist Manuel Anselmi described populism as being ""deeply connected with democracy"", and March suggested that populism represented a ""critique of democracy, not an alternative to it"". Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser write that ""In a world that is dominated by democracy and liberalism, populism has essentially become an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism."" Adamidis argues that the effect of populism on democracy can be measured by reference to its impact on the democratic legal systems and, in particular, to the changes it effects on their rule of recognition.

Populism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilisation of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making. It can also raise awareness among the socio-political elites of popular concerns in society, even if it makes the former uncomfortable. When some populists have taken power—most notably, Chávez in Venezuela—they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referendums. For this reason, some democratic politicians have argued that they need to become more populist: René Cuperus of the Dutch Labour Party for instance called for social democracy to become ""more 'populist' in a leftist way"" in order to engage with voters who felt left behind by cultural and technological change.

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that ""populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with  democracy,"" since populism is based on putting into effect ""the will of the people"". It is therefore majoritarian in nature, and opposed to the safeguarding of minority rights, which is a defining feature of liberal democracy. Populism also undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejecting notions of pluralism and the idea that anything, including constitutional limits, should constrain the ""general will"" of ""the people"". In this, populist governance can lead to what the liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill described as the ""tyranny of the majority"".

Populists tend to view democratic institutions as alienating, and in practice, populists operating in liberal democracies have often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media. Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists. In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media. Minorities have often suffered as a result; in Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by populist governments. In several instances—such as Orban in Hungary—the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government. A December 2018 study of 46 populist leaders argued that populists, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, were more likely to damage democratic institutions, erode checks and balances on the executive branch, cause democratic backsliding and attack individual rights than non-populists.

Even when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People's Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.

Mainstream responses
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment. They also argued that stronger rule of law and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth. They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who ""claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong"". They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism. What Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented ""them"" as ""evil"" or ""foolish"", for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ. In their view, ""the best way to deal with populism is to engage—as difficult as it is—in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters"" in order to ""better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them"".

Mainstream politicians have sometimes sought to co-operate or build alliances with populists. In the United States, for example, various Republican Party figures aligned themselves with the Tea Party movement, while in countries such as Finland and Austria populist parties have taken part in governing coalitions. In other instances, mainstream politicians have adopted elements of a populist political style while competing against populist opponents. Various mainstream centrist figures, such as Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair, have argued that governments needed to restrict migration to hinder the appeal of right-wing populists utilising anti-immigrant sentiment in elections.

A more common approach has been for mainstream parties to openly attack the populists and construct a cordon sanitaire to prevent them from gaining political office  Once populists are in political office in liberal democracies, the judiciary can play a key role in blocking some of their more illiberal policies, as has been the case in Slovakia and Poland. The mainstream media can play an important role in blocking populist growth; in a country like Germany, the mainstream media is for instant resolutely anti-populist, opposing populist groups whether left or right.
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that there was an ""odd love-hate relationship between populist media and politicians, sharing a discourse but not a struggle"". In certain countries, certain mainstream media outlets have supported populist groups; in Austria, the Kronen Zeitung played a prominent role in endorsing Haider, in the United Kingdom the Daily Express supported the UK Independence Party, while in the United States, Fox News gave much positive coverage and encouragement to the Tea Party movement. In some cases, when the populists have taken power, their political rivals have sought to violently overthrow them; this was seen in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt, when mainstream groups worked with sectors of the military to unseat Hugo Chávez's government.

Authoritarianism
Scholars have argued that populist elements have sometimes appeared in authoritarian movements. The scholar Luke March argued that the populist Narodnik movement of late 19th-century Russia influenced the radical rejection on the constitutional limits of the state found in Marxism–Leninism. Although the Marxist–Leninist movement often used populist rhetoric—in the 1960s, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called itself the ""party of the Soviet people""—in practice its emphasis on an elite vanguard is anti-populist in basis.

The historian Roger Eatwell noted that although fascism and populism ""differ notably ideologically"", fascist politicians have ""borrowed aspects of populist discourse and style"". Some fascists have for instance used the terms ""people"" and ""nation"" synonymously. However, fascism generally distinguishes itself from populism by not recognising the democratic rights of the people or believing that they are capable of governing, instead maintaining that a vanguard should take charge. According to Eatwell, ""major ideological differences [...] lie at the core"" of fascism and populism, the former being anti-democratic and latter being rooted in democracy, ""albeit not liberal democracy"". The historian Peter Fritzsche nevertheless argued that populist movements active in Weimar Germany helped to facilitate the environment in which the fascist Nazi Party could rise to power. Fritzsche also noted that the Nazis utilised, ""at least rhetorically"", the ""populist ideal of the people's community.

At the turn of the 21st century, the pink tide spreading over Latin America was ""prone to populism and authoritarianism"". Chavez's Venezuela and Correa's Ecuador have both been characterised as having moved toward authoritarianism. Steven Levitsky and James Loxton, as well as Raúl Madrid, stated that Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and his regional allies used populism to achieve their dominance and later established authoritarian regimes when they were empowered. Such actions, Weyland argues, proves that ""Populism, understood as a strategy for winning and exerting state power, inherently stands in tension with democracy and the value that it places upon pluralism, open debate, and fair competition"".

History

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argue that populism is a modern phenomenon. However, attempts have been made to identify manifestations of populism in the democracy of classical Athens. Eatwell noted that although the actual term populism parallels that of the Populares who were active in the Roman Republic, these and other pre-modern groups ""did not develop a truly populist ideology."" The origins of populism are often traced to the late nineteenth century, when movements calling themselves populist arose in both the United States and the Russian Empire. Populism has often been linked to the spread of democracy, both as an idea and as a framework for governance.

Conversely, the historian Barry S. Strauss argued that populism could also be seen in the ancient world, citing the examples of the fifth-century B.C. Athens and Populares, a political faction active in the Roman Republic from the second century BCE. The historian Rachel Foxley argued that the Levellers of 17th-century England could also be labelled ""populists"", meaning that they believed ""equal natural rights [...] must shape political life"" while the historian Peter Blickle linked populism to the Protestant Reformation.

Europe

19th and 20th centuries

In the Russian Empire during the late 19th century, the narodnichestvo movement emerged, championing the cause of the empire's peasantry against the governing elites. The movement was unable to secure its objectives; however, it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century. Although the Russian movement was primarily a movement of the middle class and intellectuals ""going to the people"", in some respects their agrarian populism was similar to that of the US People's Party, with both presenting small farmers (the peasantry in Europe) as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality. According to Eatwell, the narodniks ""are often seen as the first populist movement"".

In German-speaking Europe, the völkisch movement has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews. In France, the Boulangist movement also utilised populist rhetoric and themes. In the early 20th century, adherents of both Marxism and fascism flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society. Among Marxists, the emphasis on class struggle and the idea that the working classes are affected by false consciousness are also antithetical to populist ideas.

In the years following the Second World War, populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism–Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties. However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent. These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring. These included Guglielmo Giannini's Common Man's Front in 1940s Italy, Pierre Poujade's Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans in late 1950s France, Hendrik Koekoek's Farmers' Party of the 1960s Netherlands, and Mogens Glistrup's Progress Party of 1970s Denmark. Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's New Left, including from the new social movements and from the early Green parties. However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became ""a relevant political force in Europe"", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.

Following the fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe. In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of ""the people"" against the ""elite"", representing the old governing Marxist–Leninist parties. The Czech Civic Forum party for instance campaigned on the slogan ""Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody"". Many populists in this region claimed that a ""real"" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist–Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change. The collapse of Marxism–Leninism as a central force in socialist politics also led to a broader growth of left-wing populism across Europe, reflected in groups like the Dutch Socialist Party, Scottish Socialist Party, and German's The Left party. Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of José María Ruiz Mateos, Jesús Gil and Mario Conde, businessmen who entered politics chiefly to defend their personal economic interests, but by the turn of the millennium their proposals had proved to meet a limited support at the ballots at the national level.

21st century

At the turn of the 21st century, populist rhetoric and movements became increasingly apparent in Western Europe. Populist rhetoric was often used by opposition parties. For example, in the 2001 electoral campaign, the Conservative Party leader William Hague accused Tony Blair's governing Labour Party government of representing ""the condescending liberal elite"". Hague repeatedly referring to it as ""metropolitan"", implying that it was out of touch with ""the people"", who in Conservative discourse are represented by ""Middle England"". Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail fox hunting on animal welfare grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport. Blair's rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology.

By the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right. The term came to be used in reference both to radical right groups like Jörg Haider's FPÖ in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia or Pim Fortuyn's LPF in the Netherlands. The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism. Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the Syriza party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement. Like Europe's right-wing populists, these groups also expressed Eurosceptic sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective rather than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts. Populists have entered government in many countries across Europe, both in coalitions with other parties as well by themselves, Austria and Poland are examples of these respectively.

The UK Labour Party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn has been called populist, with the slogan ""for the many not the few"" having been used. Corbyn was suspended from Labour following findings on unlawful action from a Equality and Human Rights Commission report. Corbyn's suspension was controversial, and many local Labour Parties passed motions opposing the decision.

The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) had been characterised as a right-wing populist party.  After the 2016 UK referendum on membership of the European Union, in which British citizens voted to leave, some have claimed the ""Brexit"" as a victory for populism, encouraging a flurry of calls for referendums among other EU countries by populist political parties.

North America 

In North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilisation and loose organisation. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States. In this instance, populism was combined with agrarianism and often known as ""prairie populism"". For these groups, ""the people"" were yeomen—small, independent farmers —while the ""elite"" were the bankers and politicians of the northeast. In some cases, populist activists called for alliances with labor (the first national platform of the National People's Party in 1892 calling for protecting the rights of ""urban workmen"". In the state of Georgia in the early 1890s, Thomas E. Watson (later the Populist candidate for Vice-President) led a major effort to unite white and African-American farmers.

The People's Party of the late 19th century United States is considered to be ""one of the defining populist movements""; its members were often referred to as the Populists at the time. Its radical platform included calling for the nationalisation of railways, the banning of strikebreakers, and the introduction of referendums. The party gained representation in several state legislatures during the 1890s, but was not powerful enough to mount a successful presidential challenge. In the 1896 presidential election, the People's Party supported the Democratic Party candidate William Jennings Bryan; after his defeat, the People's Party's support declined. Other early populist political parties in the United States included the Greenback Party, the Progressive Party of 1912 led by Theodore Roosevelt, the Progressive Party of 1924 led by Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and the Share Our Wealth movement of Huey P Long in 1933–1935. In Canada, populist groups adhering to a social credit ideology had various successes at local and regional elections from the 1930s to the 1960s, although the main Social Credit Party of Canada never became a dominant national force.

By the mid-20th century, US populism had moved from a largely progressive to a largely reactionary stance, being closely intertwined with the anti-communist politics of the period. In this period, the historian Richard Hofstadter and sociologist Daniel Bell compared the anti-elitism of the 1890s Populists with that of Joseph McCarthy. Although not all academics accepted the comparison between the left-wing, anti-big business Populists and the right-wing, anti-communist McCarthyites, the term ""populist"" nonetheless came to be applied to both left-wing and right-wing groups that blamed elites for the problems facing the country. Some mainstream politicians in the Republican Party recognised the utility of such a tactic and adopted it; Republican President Richard Nixon for instance popularised the term ""silent majority"" when appealing to voters. Right-wing populist rhetoric was also at the base of two of the most successful third-party presidential campaigns in the late 20th century, that of George C. Wallace in 1968 and Ross Perot in 1992. These politicians presented a consistent message that a ""liberal elite"" was threatening ""our way of life"" and using the welfare state to placate the poor and thus maintain their own power.

Former Oklahoma Senator Fred R. Harris, first elected in 1964, ran unsuccessfully for the US presidency in 1972 and 1976. Harris' New Populism embraced egalitarian themes.

In the first decade of the 21st century, two populist movements appeared in the US, both in response to the Great Recession: the Occupy movement and the Tea Party movement. The populist approach of the Occupy movement was broader, with its ""people"" being what it called ""the 99%"", while the ""elite"" it challenged was presented as both the economic and political elites. The Tea Party's populism was Producerism, while ""the elite"" it presented was more party partisan than that of Occupy, being defined largely—although not exclusively—as the Democratic administration of President Barack Obama.
The 2016 presidential election saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, with both candidates running on anti-establishment platforms in the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively. Both campaigns criticised free trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Other studies have noted an emergence of populist rhetoric and a decline in the value of prior experience in U.S. intra-party contests such as congressional primaries.

Latin America 

Populism has been dominant in Latin American politics since the 1930s and 1940s, being far more prevalent there than in Europe. Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that the region has the world's ""most enduring and prevalent populist tradition"". They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism. March instead thought that it was the important role of ""catch-all parties and prominent personalities"" in Latin American politics which had made populism more common.

The first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the Great Depression in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s. In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising ""the people"": these included Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, Juan Perón in Argentina, and José María Velasco Ibarra in Ecuador. These relied on the Americanismo ideology, presenting a common identity across Latin America and denouncing any interference from imperialist powers. The second wave took place in the early 1990s; de la Torre called it ""neoliberal populism"". In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation. Examples include Carlos Menem in Argentina, Fernando Collor de Mello in Brazil, and Alberto Fujimori in Peru. Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Unlike the first wave, the second did not include an emphasis on Americanismo or anti-imperialism.

The third wave began in the final years of the 1990s and continued into the 21st century. It overlapped in part with the pink tide of left-wing resurgence in Latin America. Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist programme that opposed the free market. Prominent examples included Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty ""back to the people"", in particular through the formation of constituent assemblies that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums. In this way they claimed to be correcting the problems of social and economic injustice that liberal democracy had failed to deal with, replacing it with superior forms of democracy.

Oceania 

During the 1990s, there was a growth in populism in both Australia and New Zealand.

In New Zealand, Robert Muldoon, the 31st Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1975 to 1984, had been cited as a populist. Populism has become a pervasive trend in New Zealand politics since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional voting system in 1996. The New Zealand Labour Party's populist appeals in its 1999 election campaign and advertising helped to propel the party to victory in that election. New Zealand First has presented a more lasting populist platform; long-time party leader Winston Peters has been characterised by some as a populist who uses anti-establishment rhetoric, though in a uniquely New Zealand style.

Sub-Saharan Africa

In much of Africa, populism has been a rare phenomenon. The political scientist Danielle Resnick argued that populism first became apparent in Africa during the 1980s, when a series of coups brought military leaders to power in various countries. In Ghana, for example, Jerry Rawlings took control, professing that he would involve ""the people"" in ""the decision-making process"", something he claimed had previously been denied to them. A similar process took place in neighbouring Burkina Faso under the military leader Thomas Sankara, who professed to ""take power out of the hands of our national
bourgeoisie and their imperialist allies and put it in the hands of the people"". Such military leaders claimed to represent ""the voice of the people"", utilised an anti-establishment discourse, and established participatory organisations through which to maintain links with the broader population.

In the 21st century, with the establishment of multi-party democratic systems in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, new populist politicians have appeared. These have included Kenya's Raila Odinga, Senegal's Abdoulaye Wade, South Africa's Julius Malema, and Zambia's Michael Sata. These populists have arisen in democratic rather than authoritarian states, and have arisen amid dissatisfaction with democratisation, socio-economic grievances, and frustration at the inability of opposition groups to oust incumbent parties.

Asia and the Arab world

In North Africa, populism was associated with the approaches of several political leaders active in the 20th century, most notably Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. However, populist approaches only became more popular in the Middle East during the early 21st century, by which point it became integral to much of the region's politics. Here, it became an increasingly common element of mainstream politics in established representative democracies, associated with longstanding leaders like Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. Although the Arab Spring was not a populist movement itself, populist rhetoric was present among protesters.

In southeast Asia, populist politicians emerged in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of Joseph Estrada in the Philippines, Roh Moo-hyun in South Korea, Chen Shui-bian in Taiwan, and Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand.
In India, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which rose to increasing power in the early 21st century adopted a right-wing populist position. Unlike many other successful populist groups, the BJP was not wholly reliant on the personality of its leader, but survived as a powerful electoral vehicle under several leaders.

Late 20th- and early 21st-century growth
Sheri Berman reviews various explanations of populism including ""demand- and supply-side explanations of populism, economic grievance–based and sociocultural grievance–based explanations of populism, and structure- and agency-based explanations of populism"".  There is now a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary literature in this area.

In the early 1990s, there was an increasing awareness of populism in established liberal democracies, sometimes referred to as the ""New Populism"". The UK's referendum on European Union membership and the election of Donald Trump, both in 2016, generated a substantial rise in interest in the concept from both academics and the public. By 2016, ""populism"" was regularly used by political commentators.

A 2017 review of votes for populistic parties in all developed countries discovered them spiking in 2015 and reaching highest levels since WWII.

Mudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies. He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals. Since the late 1960s, the emergence of television had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties. As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists. At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws. News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events. At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the ""high culture"" of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in reality television shows such as Big Brother.

Mudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups. In Mudde's words, ""More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better.""

Another factor is that in the post-Cold War period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting. There is also the impact of globalisation, which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites. Such factors undermine citizens' belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for charismatic leadership to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.
Peter Wilkins has argued that ""The end of history and the post-Cold War extension and deepening of capitalism are central to understanding the rise of contemporary populist movements."" 

Pippa Norris and  Ronald Inglehart connect economic and sociocultural theories of the causes of support for the growing populist movements in Western societies. The first theory they examine is the economic insecurity perspective which focuses on the consequences created by a transforming contemporary workforce and society in post-industrial economies. Norris suggests that events such as globalisation, China's membership of the World Trade Organisation and cheaper imports have left the unsecured members of society (low-waged unskilled workers, single parents, the long term unemployed and the poorer white populations) seeking populist leaders such as Donald Trump and Nigel Farage.  The other theory is the cultural backlash thesis, in which Norris and Inglehart suggest that the rise of populism is a reaction from previously dominant sectors of the population, the white, uneducated, elderly men of today, who feel threatened and marginalised by the progressive values of modern society. These groups in particular have a growing resentment towards their traditional values being scolded as politically incorrect and are much more likely to become supportive of anti-establishment, xenophobic political parties.
Norris and Inglehart have analyzed data from the World Values Survey.  On this basis, they argue that while the proximate cause of right-wing populist voting may be identified in sociocultural grievances, such grievances are increasingly being driven by economic insecurity and the erosion of traditional values.

It connects to Interstate 93 in Somerville, Massachusetts (the ""Northern Expressway"") at the north end (exit 18, formerly 26 from I-93 South) and splits at the south end, providing direct access to both Storrow Drive and Leverett Circle in Boston.  Going northbound, there is also a fork which provides access to the City Square Tunnel under Charlestown to proceed on U.S. 1 North via the Tobin Bridge.

The span was built in conjunction with the more dramatic Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge as part of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, widely known as the Big Dig. During construction, the Leverett Circle Connector Bridge was sometimes called ""Baby Bridge"".  The bridge opened for traffic on October 7, 1999, at a cost of $22.27 million.

Also known as the Storrow Drive Connector, it is the largest steel box girder bridge in the United States. It was the winner of a July 2001 National Steel Bridge Alliance (NSBA) ""prize bridge"" Award. Its weaving design was determined by the other major structures involved in the Big Dig but unlike other parts of the project, it was finished eight days ahead of schedule.

Major intersections
The entire route is in Boston, Suffolk County.

46,20904428,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%20Kasam,Ram Kasam,"Ram Kasam is a 1978 Bollywood action film directed by Chand, with music by Sonik Omi and lyrics by Verma Malik. The film is based on the Dacoity of the Chambal division; bandits of Morena and Chambal, thronging the locales of the mountainous valleys of the Chambal River. It has Sunil Dutt in a double role; as a simpleton, and as a dacoit, with love interests as Rekha and Bindiya Goswami. The film is an inspiring tale portraying ritualistic Hinduism and characters who show traits of their bloodline irrespective of the social setup that they have been forced into. The film was successful at the box office .

Story
The story starts with a stormy sea and strong winds which are wrecking a ship carrying the family of Inspector Ajit Singh (Ajit), his wife Laxmi (Nirupa Roy) and twins Ajay and Vijay. Terror struck they are thrown on the waves of the angry seas and land on drifting pieces of wood, on the shores of India. Laxmi becomes blind with shock, although Ajay is saved with her, whom she names Bhola (Sunil Dutt), seeking refuge with a Zamindar (D. K. Sapru), to work as their menial chores servant. Meanwhile Vijay is misled to a life of crime and becomes Shankar (also Sunil Dutt), with his gangster moll being Suzy (Bindu).

Ajit Singh who goes to the local police station to lodge a complaint about his missing family, expresses a desire to stay back in India, to the serving Inspector Jagdish Raj, who impressed by his honesty and zeal gets him recruited in to the police set-up, calling his service record from Africa.

Shankar who has become a famous dacoit, intercepts a truck carrying looted valuables to loot, but is hounded by none other than Inspector Ajit Singh, who however fails to arrest him, due to Suzy and Shankar escaping into a nightclub, where they don the garbs of artists and start performing a dance item. Their entire loot is then carried into Shankar's hide out where Shankar tells his gang members that looting heinous criminals is not a sin. Further he insults Suzy when she disrespects an Om symbol locket which was given to Shankar by his lost mother, as being worthless in a cache of priceless jewels. This irks Suzy who with Johnny betrays Shankar to the police when he goes to loot a train. Shankar is caught with the loot and jailed with dacoits of the Chambal division. He manages to escape with them, and to punish Suzy for her betrayal, brings her to this lair of thieves.

Meanwhile, Bhola is shown to be very loyal to the Zamindar, whose own son, called Chhote Thakur (Amjad Khan), is no less than a dacoit, out to loot his own family of all assets and belongings, for a life of vice and sin and ill treating Bhola for his efforts to save the same. The Zamindar is taken ill and dies telling about all his treasures to Bhola. Shankar who has also taken refuge with the dacoits in the same village is again betrayed by Suzy and saved by Radha (Rekha). Shankar and Radha falls for each other soon, on the other side, Bhola and Champa (Bindiya Goswami) fall in love.

Bhola is framed in a false theft by Chhote Thakur and jailed. Shankar who is being pursued by the police lands in the house of Laxmi who being blind thinks that it is her son Bhola who has come to meet her. In a series of twists and turns Shankar realises that she is his lost mother and Bhola his twin. Taking the place of Bhola he metes out avenging punishments to all those who had ill treated Bhola. When his mother is captured by Chhote Thakur as hostage for bringing all the family wealth back to him, both Bhola and Shankar interchange roles and not only avenge this, but return the entire wealth of the village to the government, after punishing the dacoits. Inspector Ajit Singh who has also reached the scene of crime recognises his lost family. Laxmi also regains her sight after being treated properly at a local hospital. Both Radha and Champa, who are the love interests of Shankar and Bhola respectively, help in restoring happiness to the village, as well as peace returns with law and order. Inspector Ajit Singh however, arrests Shankar for his petty crimes, promising him an early release for helping the police.

47,4390289,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsuri,Mahsuri,"Mahsuri Binti Pandak Mayah was a young woman who lived in Pulau Langkawi, an island in Kedah, Malaysia, during the late 18th century. According to folklore, she was accused of adultery and executed by stabbing. Her tomb, Makam Mahsuri, has become a tourist attraction on the island.

Legend
Mahsuri was the daughter of a Malay farmer who moved from their native Negeri Pulau Bukit to the island of Langkawi in search of a better life. She was the most beautiful woman in all of Langkawi and married the warrior Wan Darus. As was required of him, her husband had to go to war on behalf of Kedah against Thailand, leaving Mahsuri behind to fend for herself. It was during this time that Mahsuri befriended a young traveler named Dearman. The village chief's wife Wan Mahora was jealous of Mahsuri's beauty. She spread a rumour that Mahsuri was unfaithful and was having an affair with Dearman in the absence of Wan Darus. Eventually, the rumours grew strong enough that the villagers openly accused her of adultery. Mahsuri pleaded her innocence, but no one believed her. 
 
Mahsuri was to be tied to a tree and stabbed to death but it didn't work. After every execution attempt failed, Mahsuri told them to kill her with her family's 'keris'. When she was stabbed, white blood flowed from the wound, signifying her innocence. Some birds flew above her to cover her body. With her dying breath, Mahsuri cursed Langkawi to have seven generations of bad luck. The kingdom was soon taken over by Thailand. The villagers at Padang Mat Sirat burned their paddy fields rather than let them fall into the hands of the Thai colonizers.

Mahsuri's family returned to Negeri Pulau Bukit, which was soon annexed by Thailand and changed to Phuket due to massive Thainization of Thai Malays by the emerging colonizers.

Impact
Many Langkawi locals believe the legend to be true, citing the decades of failed crops that followed Mahsuri's death. Langkawi was also attacked by Thailand numerous times, the last invasion taking place in 1821. The field which was torched by the farmers is still known as Beras Terbakar or ""burnt rice"". It is only at the end of the 20th century after the seven generations have supposedly come to pass, that Langkawi began to prosper as a tourist destination.  Mahsuri's descendants continue to live in Bukit, Thailand, and have on occasion returned to Langkawi to visit her tomb. Among them was Sirintra Yayee (ศิรินทรา ยายี), real Malay name: Wan Aishah Wan Nawawi, who came into the spotlight during her visit to Kedah in 2000.

52,1277086,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking%20%28rocket%29,Viking (rocket),"Viking was series of twelve sounding rockets designed and built by the Glenn L. Martin Company under the direction of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Designed to supersede the German V-2, the Viking was the most advanced large, liquid-fueled rocket developed in the United States in the late 1940s, returning valuable scientific data from the edge of space between 1949-1955. Viking 4, launched in 1950, was the first sounding rocket to be launched from the deck of a ship.

After twelve flights, the Viking was adapted into the first stage for the Vanguard rocket, which launched America's second satellite into orbit in 1958.

Origins 
After World War II, the United States experimented with captured German V-2 rockets as part of the Hermes program. Based on these experiments the U.S. issued a contract 21 August 1946 to the Glenn L. Martin Company for a series of ten large liquid-fueled rockets. The intent was to provide an independent U.S. capability in rocketry, to continue the Hermes program after the V-2s were expended, and to provide a vehicle better suited to scientific research. Originally dubbed ""Neptune,"" it was renamed ""Viking"" in 1947 to avoid confusion with the Lockheed P-2 Neptune The Viking was the most advanced large, liquid-fueled rocket being developed in the U.S. at the time.

Design 

The Viking was roughly half the size, in terms of mass and power, of the V-2. Both were actively guided rockets, fueled with the same propellant (Ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen), which were fed to a single large pump-fed engine by two turbine-driven pumps. The Reaction Motors XLR10-RM-2  engine was the largest liquid-fueled rocket engine developed in the United States up to that time, producing  (sea level) and  (vacuum) of thrust. Isp was  and  respectively, with a mission time of 103 seconds. As was also the case for the V-2, hydrogen peroxide was converted to steam to drive the turbopump that fed fuel and oxidizer into the engine. As its V-2 counterpart, it also was regeneratively cooled.

Viking pioneered important innovations over the V-2. One of the most significant for rocketry was the use of a gimbaled thrust chamber which could be swiveled from side to side on two axes for pitch and yaw control, dispensing with the inefficient and somewhat fragile graphite vanes in the engine exhaust used by the V-2. The rotation of the engine on the gimbals was controlled by gyroscopic inertial reference; this type of guidance system was invented by Robert H. Goddard, who had partial success with it before World War II intervened. Roll control was by use of the turbopump exhaust to power reaction control system (RCS) jets on the fins. Compressed gas jets stabilized the vehicle after the main power cutoff. Similar devices are now extensively used in large, steerable rockets and in space vehicles. Another improvement was that initially the alcohol tank, and later the LOX tank also, were built integral with the outer skin, saving weight. The structure was also largely aluminum, as opposed to steel used in the V-2, thus shedding more weight.

Vikings 1 through 7 were slightly longer (about ) than the V-2, but with a straight cylindrical body only  in diameter, making the rocket quite slender. They had fairly large fins similar to those on the V-2. Vikings 8 through 14 were built with an enlarged airframe of improved design. The diameter was increased to , while the length was reduced to , altering the missile's ""pencil shape"". The fins were made much smaller and triangular. The added diameter meant more fuel and more weight, but the ""mass ratio"", of fueled to empty mass, was improved to about 5:1, a record for the time.

Flight history

First model (Vikings 1-7) 

On 3 May 1949, after two static firings (11 March and 25 April), the first Viking rocket took off from White Sands White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Its engine fired for 55 seconds, ten seconds short of the hoped-for maximum of 65, but the rocket flew on course and reached an altitude of  -- deemed a good start to the program. Viking 2, launched four months later, also suffered from premature engine cutoff and only made it to . Both had suffered from leaks in their turbines, the intense heat of the steam breaking the seal of the turbine casing. The solution was to weld the casing shut, there being no reason to access the turbine wheel again after a flight.

The fix worked, and Viking 3, launched 9 February 1950 and incorporating an integrated (rather than discrete) oxygen tank, reached  and could have gone higher. However, after 34 seconds of accurately guided flight, the rocket veered westward and threatened to leave the launch range. Range safety triggered charges in the rocket to separate the nose from the engine, and both tumbled to the ground, where they were recovered for analysis.

With successful tests of the engine and guidance systems conducted (though not on the same missions), Viking was deemed ready for its most ambitious test: shipboard launch from the deck of the USS Norton Sound. Viking 4 was identical to Viking 3, the first of the series not incorporate design changes to fix a problem on a previous Viking.} On 10 May, 1950, from a site in the Pacific Ocean between Jarvis Island and Christmas Island, the fourth Viking became the first sounding rocket ever launched from a sea-going vessel. The flight was perfect, reaching , more than double that reached by Vikings 1 and 3.

Viking 5, launched 21 November 1950 carried a vast array of photomultiplier tubes, ionization chambers and Geiger counters, for the detection radiation across a wide variety of energies and types. The rocket also carried two movie cameras to take high altitude film of the Earth all the way to its peak height of  as well as Pirani gauges to measure air densities in the upper atmosphere. Viking 6, launched 11 December, carried a much lighter payload, but its experiments included a battery of custom built pressure gauges. The rocket underperformed, however, only reaching a maximum altitude of .

The first generation of Vikings reached its acme of performance with the flight of Viking 7, the sole Viking launch of 1951. Launched 7 August from White Sands, the rocket set a new world altitude record of .

Second model (Vikings 8-12) 

In the late spring of 1952, the Naval Research Laboratory team under the management of Milton Rosen prepared to launch the first second-generation Viking, Viking 8, from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The new Viking design was nearly half-again as wide as its precursor, affording the highest fuel-to-weight ratio of any rocket yet developed. The tail fins no longer supported the weight of the rocket, has had previously been the case. Now, the Viking rocket rested on the base of its fuselage. This allowed the tail fins to be made much lighter, one of many ways the Viking was redesigned to carry a heavier tank without weighing more than the first Viking design.

On 6 June 1952, Viking 8 broke loose of its moorings during a static firing test. After it was allowed to fly for 55 seconds in the hope that it would clear the immediate area and thus pose no danger to ground crew, Nat Wagner, head of the ""Cutoff group"" delivered a command to the rocket to cease its thrust. 65 seconds later, the rocket crashed  or  downrange to the southeast.

With lessons learned from the Viking 8 failure, the successful 9 December static firing of Viking 9 was followed on 15 December by a successful launch from White Sands. The rocket reached an altitude of , roughly the same as that of the first-generation Viking 7, launched in 1950. In addition to cameras that photographed the Earth during flight, Viking 9 carried a full suite of cosmic ray, ultraviolet, and X-ray detectors, including sixteen plates of emulsion gel for tracking the path of individual high energy particles. The experiment package was recovered intact after it had secured measurements high in the Earth's upper atmosphere.

Viking 10 

On 25 May 1953, Viking 10, originally planned to be the last of the Vikings, arrived at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. A successful static firing on 18 June cleared the way for a 30 June launch date, a schedule that had been made months prior, before the rocket had even left the Glenn L. Martin Company plant where it had been built. At the moment of liftoff, the tail of Viking 10 exploded, setting the rocket afire. Water was immediately flooded into the rocket's base in an attempt to extinguish the fire, but flames continued to burn in the East Quadrant of the firing platform. Half an hour after launch, two of the launch team under manager Milton Rosen were dispatched to put out the fire to salvage what remained of the rocket. 

Their efforts were successful but then were threatened by a slow leak in the propellant tank. The vacuum created by the departing fuel was causing the tank to dimple with the danger of implosion that would cause the rocket to collapse. Lieutenant Joseph Pitts, a member of the launch team, shot a rifle round into the tank, equalizing the pressure and saving the rocket. Three hours after the attempted launch, the last of the alcohol propellant had been drained from Viking 10. The launch team was able to salvage the instrument package of cameras, including X-ray detectors, cosmic ray emulsions, and a radio-frequency mass-spectrometer, valued at tens of thousands of dollars, although there was concern that the rocket was irreparable.

A thorough investigation of the explosion began in July, but a conclusive cause could not be determined. In a report presented in September, Milton Rosen noted that a similar occurrence had not happened in more than 100 prior tests of the Viking motor. It was decided to rebuild Viking 10, and a program for closer monitoring of potential fail points was implemented for the next launch, scheduled for 1954. Ten months of salvage, testing, and troubleshooting followed the failed launch.

On 30 June, 1953, the rebuilt rocket was once again ready for launch. A successful static firing took place at the end of April 1954, and launch was scheduled for 4 May. Control issues revealed in the static firing as well as gusty, sand-laden winds caused a delay of three days. At 10:00 AM local time, Viking 10 blasted off from its pad at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, reaching an altitude of  -- a tie with the highest altitude ever reached by a first-generation Viking (Viking 7 on 7 August 1951). Data was received from the rocket for all stages of the flight, and its scientific package, including an emulsion experiment, returned the first measurement of positive ion composition at high altitudes.

Final flights 

Viking 11, which was ready for erection on 5 May, also had a successful static test and was ready for launch, 24 May 1954. Again, the countdown went without hold, and Viking 11, the heaviest rocket yet in the series, was launched at 10:00 AM. Forty seconds into the flight, several puffs of smoke issued from the vehicle, but these accidental excitations of the rocket's roll jets did no harm. Viking 11 ultimately reached  in altitude, a record for the series, snapping the highest altitude photographs of the Earth to date. Viking 11 carried a successful emulsions experiment, measuring cosmic rays at high altitudes.

The final Viking flight was that of Viking 12, launched 4 February 1955. Reaching an altitude of , the rocket's K-25 camera snapped an infrared picture of the Southwestern United States, from the Pacific coast to Phoenix, just after reaching its apogee.

Viking into Vanguard 

The Viking series returned a bonanza of scientific information measuring temperature, pressure, density, composition and winds in the upper atmosphere and electron density in the ionosphere, and recording the ultraviolet spectra of the Sun, The success of the program, at a cost of under $6 million, suggested that, with a more powerful engine and the addition of upper stages, the Viking rocket could be made a vehicle capable of launching an Earth satellite. 

In October 1952, the General Assembly of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) adopted a proposal to undertake simultaneous observations of geophysical phenomena over the entire surface of the Earth. The International Geophysical Year (IGY), set for 1957-58, would involve the efforts of a multitude of nations in such farflung regions as the Arctic and Antarctica. In January 1955, Radio Moscow announced that the Soviet Union might be expected to launch a satellite in the near future. This announcement galvanized American space efforts; in the same month, the National Academy of Sciences' IGY committee established a Technical Panel on Rocketry to evaluate plans to orbit an American satellite. 

On 26 May 1955, the American National Security Council also endorsed a satellite program. On 8 June, United States Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson directed Assistant Secretary Donald A. Quarles to coordinate the implementation of a satellite program, with the United States Department of Defense providing the rocket and launch facilities, and the civilian IGY National Committee producing the satellite and its experimental package, the National Science Foundation being intermediary between the two agencies. A committee, under the chairmanship of Homer J. Stewart of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was developed to manage the project to weigh and choose between the available satellite orbiting options. They were Project Orbiter, an Army plan to use a slightly modified Redstone (a ) range surface-to-surface missile developed the prior year) combined with upper stages to put a satellite into orbit, which could be tracked optically., and the NRL plan to develop an orbital capability for the Viking (Project Vanguard).

On 28 July, confident that a satellite could be lofted during the IGY, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, announced that a satellite would officially be among the United States' contributions to the IGY. The Soviets responded four days later with their own announcement of an planned IGY satellite launch.

By 9 September, the Stewart Committee had chosen Vanguard over Orbiter, citing the Navy's impressive planned Minitrack communications technology and network as well as both the civilian nature and the greater growth potential of the Viking/Vanguard rocket. The contract authorizing the construction of two more Viking rockets to continue upper atmospheric research was expanded to include development of the Vanguard rockets. The Viking was thus incorporated as the first stage of NRL's three-stage Project Vanguard vehicle which launched the second U.S. satellite in 1958. Vikings 13 and 14, substantially similar to Vikings 8 through 12, were used as suborbital test vehicles (Vanguard TV-0 and Vanguard TV-1) before the first Vanguard vehicle, Vanguard TV-2, became available for test in the fall of 1957.

Current examples 

The National Air and Space Museum contains a full-size cutaway reconstruction of Viking 12, built from original blueprints and reconstructed from parts recovered from the original rocket. The vehicle was donated by the Martin Marietta Corp in 1976 to the Smithsonian.

Gadgor is in the centre of the Chawinda and Kingrah sectors.

Gadgor was a well-established village before the Indo-Pakistan partition in 1947. Before August 1965, the Pakistani army shifted residents of the area to other places to protect them from the advancing Indian army, which had crossed into Pakistani territory. The 1965 war witnessed some of the largest tank battles since World War II. India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armoured Division and supporting units, was brought to a halt by the 6th Armoured Division (ex-100th independent brigade group) in the Chawinda sector. Pakistan claimed that India lost 120 tanks at Chawinda. Gadgor village still has monuments to the 1965 war.

In Sialkot, outnumbered Pattons (Pakistani Army tanks) performed well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division.

Demography

Gadgor is a multi-caste village composed mostly of RajputSulehri, Sayed, Gujjar, Jaffari, and Bajwa clan members. Historically, the people of Gadgor relied on agriculture and labor for employment. Over the years, emigration to the Gulf States has become a trend; many have moved to Saudi Arabia.

Girls' education is encouraged. Cricket, volleyball, kabaddi, and football are the most popular sports in Gadgor.

59,2338193,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%20Stage%203,Key Stage 3,"Key Stage 3 (commonly abbreviated as KS3) is the legal term for the three years of schooling in maintained schools in England and Wales normally known as Year 7, Year 8 and Year 9, when pupils are aged between 11 and 14. In Northern Ireland the term also refers to the first three years of secondary education, although these are known as Year 8, Year 9 and Year 10.

England and Wales

Legal definition
The term is defined in the Education Act 2002 as ""the period beginning at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class attain the age of twelve and ending at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class attain the age of fourteen"".

This Key Stage normally covers pupils during their first three years of secondary education, although in some cases part or all of this stage may fall in a middle or high school. Some middle and high schools have been piloting accelerated Key Stage 3, by teaching the curriculum over two years.

Purpose
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the National Curriculum. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in at least 15 areas:
English
Mathematics
Science
Computing
Design and Technology
History
Geography
Modern Foreign Language
Art and Design
Music
Physical Education
Career education
Welsh (in Wales only)

At the end of this stage, pupils aged 14 or almost age 14 — in Year 9 — are assessed as part of the national programme of National Curriculum assessment. Until 2008 this involved a series of externally marked tests. However, from 2009, this will be based on on-going teacher assessment, with results for each school being published in performance tables. They also undergo tests before moving up to Key Stage 4

Northern Ireland

Legal definition
The term is defined in The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 as ""key stage 3 is the period beginning at the same time as the next school year after the end of key stage 2 and ending at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class complete three school years in that key stage"". Notably, the foundation stage and Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 are defined as lasting for seven years in total from the start of compulsory education.

Purpose
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the National Curriculum. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in the nine areas of learning in the curriculum, some of which include specific subject strands:

Language and Literacy
English
Irish (in Irish-speaking schools)

63,1315702,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless%20Village,Wireless Village,"Wireless Village is a set of specifications for mobile instant messaging and presence services. It is intended to be a standard for cellphones and mobile devices to use these services across platforms.

Many wireless phones now include mobile instant messaging capabilities designed to hook into messaging services using IMPS on a carrier's network, formerly known as the Wireless Village protocol. Those phones implement it as an IM icon on the phone, which is typically renamed and customized by the cellphone carrier or removed completely if not supported at the network level. Most Nokia and Motorola phones have that feature, as do many Sony Ericsson phones.

Description
The white paper describes the service:

""Where possible, the protocol makes use of existing Internet and Web technologies. These technologies are implemented widely and are well tested, so their use within the protocol ensure easy implementation and interoperability testing. XML, the Extensible Markup Language, is rapidly emerging as the lingua franca for representing structured data over the Web. To the extent possible, the protocol uses XML to represent the protocol data being exchanged during an IMPS session. IMPS activities in the IETF IMPP have received widespread interest throughout the industry. Although it is still in development, to the extent possible, the Wireless Village initiative will support the CPIM draft and build upon it. Other useful standards in this space include the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) for registering the format of the IMPS protocol messages.""

History
An announcement was made when this service was conceived by Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia. The specification is maintained by the Open Mobile Alliance, and is currently at version 1.3 of the protocol.

As of now, only a few public services exist using Wireless Village. Any unlocked phone can be configured to use these services, and therefore connect to other instant messaging services if implemented.

Operator implementations
noknok, MTN South Africa, South Africa's 1st operator launched IMPS service. It does not work with native phone applications.

Yamigo
Yamigo was a free communications service, based in Finland, that allowed instant messaging on mobile phones over wireless data services such as GPRS. The service was based on the protocol Wireless Village, developed by the Open Mobile Alliance, which is a joint venture between Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola and other mobile device manufacturers.

Certain models of mobile phones that include a chat client could access the Yamigo network. These included certain models of phones from Nokia,  Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Siemens. Once registered, Yamigo users could send messages to each other, and to users on Yahoo! Messenger, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ. Yamigo supported importing contact lists from those services automatically.

Users connected to Yamigo via WAP and the internet. On the service's sign up page, users selected how frequently their phone polled the Yamigo network. Because it is a client-server protocol, receiving messages depended on how often the phone was set to poll the network. The service was abandoned in late 2005, and the last upgrade was version .19 in April 2005.

Hunsaker left Ball State in 1993 in the midst of an NCAA Investigation, but claims to have never violated any rules. He coached the next two years in the Continental Basketball Association with Fort Wayne, Hartford and Grand Rapids. In 1995, he returned to the collegiate coaching ranks at Manchester College, where his record was 51–27.

His next coaching job was at the University of Utah, where he served as an assistant to Rick Majerus in his final years. Majerus took a leave of absence after the 2000-01 season opener due to health problems, and Hunsaker became interim head coach. Majerus had every intention of returning, but announced in January 2001 that he would sit out the remainder of the season to tend to his health and that of his mother. As acting head coach in 2001, Hunsaker led the Utes to an 18–12 record. He took the head coaching position at Utah Valley State in 2002. His first season at Utah Valley State was the school's last year as a junior college. Utah Valley joined Division I in 2009.

Hunsaker is a Latter Day Saint.

Playing career
Hunsaker enrolled at UTEP in 1972. However, he transferred to Weber State after one year. He graduated from Weber State in 1977. He received a master's degree from BYU.

It is part of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Costa Rica.

History
The School of Architecture of the University of Costa Rica was founded in 1971. Prior to that year, the few architects that were in the country, had studied mainly in México, Chile, and the United States, which means that construction was primarily regulated by civil engineers, who left their mark and perspective around the entire country, but with the insertion of many new architects, it is being reoriented toward a vision that is architectural in character.
 
The first director of the School was the plastic artist Rafael Ángel “Felo” García and the first architect graduated in Costa Rica is Ibo Bonilla Oconitrillo who has distinguished himself internationally in bioclimatic architecture and as a sculptor of the highest sculptures in the country.

Teaching methodology  
The new school started with controversy given its innovative curriculum, different from the traditional, basing its focus of the architectonic object as a part of an urban process and creating results based on its consideration of the physical and cultural environment. 

Architects Jorge Bertheau, Rafael Ángel García, and Édgar Brenes implemented the teaching methodology based on integrated multidisciplinary studies, with emphasis on teamwork and real projects applied to specific communities. They obtained a scholarship to study the architecture in England.

Academic program  
The career includes an academic program to obtain a degree in 5 years. Nevertheless, it is uncommon for a student to complete the degree within the 5 years along with the required thesis. The system is academically open, in that the student decides how many and what specific courses he wants to carry each semester.

The primary axis of the career program is in the area of design. Thus, 10 workshops on design are imparted, within which the student is challenged with various kinds of design problems: that can go from designing a cafeteria to a high rise. 
Complementary to the area of design, there are theoretical courses (which deal with, but not limited to theory on architecture), supplementary subjects, which are required by the University of Costa Rica, such as courses in art, sports, humanities, history, etc.

Masters  
•	Urban Design: with a concentration on developing proposals consistent with urban design, focusing on the Latin American reality and the behaviors of its inhabitants.
 
•	Tropical Architecture: its intent is to address architecture from the reality of Costa Rica’s climate, which encompasses tropical zones, with huge contrasts temperatures and humidity. Also, part of the emphasis of this masters program, is the intent to guide the designer towards the bioclimatic trends of design. 

•	Technology and Construction: its purpose is to guide the professionals towards an adequate use of technological tools applied to construction. It exposes the participants to the most recent innovations in the field, while simultaneously complementing the students formation with talks and additional materials. 

•	Landscaping: it deals with the relationships among architecture, the human being, and the environment with a scope controlled and defined by man. It studies more deeply the diversity of plants and construction materials from a naturalistic orientation, and how these relate to a human environment.

Admission  
There are various requirements:

•	Have completed secondary education, including the exams of the Ministry of Education of Costa Rica.

•	Have completed the admission exam of the University of Costa Rica, and have obtained on the exam, the required score needed to make it into the field of study (the score varies from year to year).

•	Pass the aptitude test from the School. 

Each year, about 1000 students who obtained the minimum score on the admission exam of the university, can enroll to take the aptitude test. Approximately 70 pass it and are admitted to study architecture.

85,27575627,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayot%20Greenway,Ayot Greenway,"The Ayot Greenway is a rail trail which extends from Ayot St. Peter, just west of Welwyn Garden City and the A1(M) Motorway to Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire. Part of National Cycle Network Route 57, it runs for three miles along a former branch line from Welwyn Garden City railway station towards Luton and Dunstable.

The line opened on 1 September 1860 and was operable for more than 100 years. Passenger numbers declined sharply after the Second World War and passenger services ended in 1951, although commercial traffic continued until 1966. Most of the track was lifted apart from a line into the Blackbridge landfill site from the Hatfield end, which continued until 1971 before the whole line was finally closed. Today, there are still visual reminders of the line, with two bridges still intact, the original fencing and even part of a collapsed railway signal.

The trail starts at the White Bridge in Welwyn Garden City, behind the library and Campus West. It continues through Sherrards Wood to the Red Lion pub on the Great North Road. Walkers and cyclists then use a road bridge over the A1(M) and pick up the trail again just north of Ayot St. Peter at what was its railway station. This was destroyed by fire in 1948 and never rebuilt. The area where it once stood is now part of a car park.

Heading west along the trail is Hunter's Bridge, which crosses another public footpath, and then under another bridge (used for farm traffic) towards Robinson's Wood. Here, a small picnic area was built, and then the trail continues towards Wheathampstead. The original line is bisected by the B653 Wheathampstead bypass on the road to Luton, so the Ayot Greenway forks left through an underpass. From here the trail follows the River Lea into Wheathampstead.

The Ayot Greenway is one of three rail trails in the Welwyn Hatfield area. The other two include Alban Way from Hatfield to St. Albans and Cole Green Way which connects Welwyn Garden City to Hertford.

Martin experienced ageism and sexism as an early woman in psychology.

Early life and education
Lillien Jane Martin was born on July 7, 1851, 
 at Olean, New York. At the age of four, she entered the nearby Olean Academy. At the age of sixteen, her talents were recognized such that she became a teacher at a girls' school in Wisconsin. By the age of 26, in 1876, she had earned enough money to return to her native New York where she enrolled at Vassar College at Poughkeepsie, New York.

Martin obtained her A. B. from Vassar College in 1880, and taught as a high school science teacher in San Francisco, California. She then studied at the University of Göttingen from 1894 until 1898. She was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Bonn in 1913. Previously, the University of Bonn had declined to admit her because she was a woman.

Professional career
She started teaching psychology at Stanford University in 1899.  In 1906, she briefly shared a house in Palo Alto with William James.  That April, both lived through the San Francisco Earthquake, which severely damaged the house and destroyed many buildings on campus.  Martin and James soon toured the ruined city together.
 

After leaving Stanford in 1916, Martin became a consulting psychologist and psychopathologist. She was the head of a mental health clinic in San Francisco.
 
This mental health clinic was the first in the world for elderly people and non-handicap children.

She was president of the California Society for Mental Hygiene; member of the Kongress fur experimentelle Psychologie; fellow of the American Psychological Association and of Sigma Xi. 

She was the author of ""Around the World with a Psychologist"" and many other works on psychology, including Mental Hygiene and Mental Training of the Pre-School Age Child. 

She was a member of the Century Club of California, the American Association of University Women, the San Francisco Woman's City Club, the San Francisco Woman's Club.

Personal life
She lived in Indiana, and moved to California in 1895. She lived at Shreve Building, San Francisco, California. A memorial bench for her and her long-time companion Fidelia Jewett (October 3, 1851 – June 21, 1933) was initially positioned in front of their apartment building, and it was later moved to Golden Gate Park.

He was an engineer and farmer in New Zealand.

William Fitzherbert was born in London in 1842, a son of William Fitzherbert. The family followed his father to Wellington about 1846. Fitzherbert was educated in Wellington, at Sydney Grammar School, and at Canterbury University College. He was an engineer with the Wellington Provincial Council and with the Hutt County Council. He farmed in the Wanganui district, and then in the Hutt Valley and in Hawke's Bay.

On 17 November 1875, he married Fanny, the adopted daughter of George Waterhouse. They had five daughters and four sons.

In 1904 he built Norbury, now Minoh Friendship House, to house his daughter Alice and her husband George William von Zedlitz, Victoria University's first professor of modern languages. Alice married Professor von Zedlitz in 1905, and Alicetown in Lower Hutt was named after her.

Fitzherbert died suddenly in Lower Hutt on 2 February 1906 of heart failure.

In 2011, plaques were installed on 13 boulders at the Hutt Recreation Ground commemorating the first 13 mayors.

The Rams looked to improve on their 8–5–1 record from 1971 and make the playoffs for the first time since 1969. After a win against the New Orleans Saints at home, the Rams tied the Chicago Bears, 13–13, their third straight season with a tie. This was followed by an embarrassing loss to the Atlanta Falcons, 31–3. However, the Rams would then pick up their winning ways, beating the San Francisco 49ers 31–7 at home, the Philadelphia Eagles 34–3 in Philly, and the Cincinnati Bengals 15–12 at home. However, following this three-game winning streak, the Rams struggled, losing several close games as they lost five of their last six to end the season 6–7–1. This was the last time the Rams missed the playoffs until 1981, as they started a dynasty the next season that won the NFC West seven consecutive times, from 1973–1979. They also finished in second place in 1980.

After two seasons as head coach of the Rams, Tommy Prothro was dismissed in late January 1973 and succeeded by Chuck Knox, previously the offensive line coach of the Detroit Lions.

Offseason
On July 13, 1972, Robert Irsay and Willard Keland bought the Los Angeles Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves and transferred ownership to Carroll Rosenbloom, in exchange for ownership of the Baltimore Colts.

92,221186,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV%20Westcountry,ITV Westcountry,"ITV Westcountry, formerly known as Westcountry Television and Carlton Westcountry, was the ITV franchise holder for the south west of England, covering Cornwall, Devon, Isles of Scilly, southern and western Somerset and western Dorset. The company replaced its predecessor, TSW (Television South West), from 1 January 1993. The station was owned and operated by ITV plc under the licensee of ITV Broadcasting Limited (formerly Westcountry Television Limited).

ITV West Country incorporating the former ITV Westcountry (""West"") and ITV West (""East"") regions was (until 31 December 2013) a non-franchise ITV regional station covering south west England.  With the formal split of the Wales and West Channel 3 licence in January 2014, a separate licence was created for Wales with the West licence merged with that of West Country. ITV West Country thus became a franchise region. Both companies which make up the new regional licence still legally exist. ITV Wales & West Ltd, ITV Wales & West Group Ltd and Westcountry Television Ltd are each, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed on www.companieshouse.gov.uk as a ""Dormant company"". This article however, covers the Westcountry Television part of the franchise.

History

Franchise award
Westcountry Television was one of two rival consortia bidding against the incumbent TSW when the ITV franchises were put to tender early in 1991. Two of Westcountry's original shareholders were Brittany Ferries and South West Water; the latter investor attracted criticism as only three years earlier it had been responsible for one of the worst water pollution incidents in the United Kingdom and which had occurred within the franchise area at Camelford. On 16 October 1991, Westcountry was announced as the winner, bidding £7 million a year against TSW's bid of £16 million a year. Several local MPs were concerned that South West Water's involvement would lead to partiality in news items concerning the local water firm.

TSW launched a legal challenge to the franchise award, and after initially being refused permission to do so in the High Court, a legal action began which would last almost three months and went all the way to the House of Lords. In February 1992 the legal process found in favour of Westcountry and while it could now finally sign the franchise agreement, its original programme plans were hit by the delay. Following discussions with the Independent Television Commission, Westcountry announced on 1 April 1992 it had abandoned the plans to build new studios on the Plymouth waterfront, opting instead to convert an industrial unit at Langage Science Park, Plymouth. It also reduced its planned staffing levels – already far fewer than those of TSW – leading to an expression of disappointment by TSW's managing director Harry Turner. Of the 297 TSW employees, only 16 found work at Westcountry at the start of the franchise. Around 112 staff were employed by Westcountry at the time of the station's launch.

Franchise operation

Westcountry replaced TSW at 00:00 GMT on 1 January 1993. The channel's launch sequence was a two-minute promo voiced by Bruce Hammal and Trish Bertram (two of Westcountry's first trail voiceovers) welcoming viewers to Westcountry and trailing its forthcoming regional programmes. The promo was followed by the Eddie Murphy and Dudley Moore film Best Defense. The new station promised an increase to 11 hours a week of regional programming of mixed genres.

Six months after the launch, the company joined up with Meridian Broadcasting, HTV, Channel Television and S4C to create a joint advertising sales operation.

During the summer of 1996, Westcountry prepared to float the company on the stock market, which resulted in HTV, United News & Media, Carlton Communications and Canwest bidding to buy out Westcountry. In October 1996 GWR, the radio group, made a bid of £70m for Westcountry TV, outbidding both HTV and Carlton, but within a few weeks United News & Media increased its offer and was expected to acquire the company, But Westcountry owners had become increasingly frustrated at the slow progress of talks and criticised United boss Lord Hollick's ""nickel and dime"" tactics over negotiations, opting instead to sell to Carlton Communications for £10m higher than United's offer of around £75m, around 25 November 1996. Hollick was described as ""disappointed but far from livid"" at the outcome. Subsequently, Westcountry was re-branded as Carlton Westcountry in September 1999, although only referred on screen as Carlton. On 27 October 2002, Carlton Westcountry lost its regional identity, and became known as ITV1 Carlton prior to regional programmes only, while being known as ITV1 at all other times. The franchise briefly became ITV1 for the Westcountry in 2003, before being renamed onscreen as ITV1 Westcountry upon the ITV plc merger of 2004, and officially taking this name two years later. ITV1 Westcountry was used for a time after this, although from 13 November 2006, the regional name was only verbally mentioned before any locally produced programming.

ITV West Country
Following a speech by Michael Grade about regional broadcasting post-switchover at the 2007 Nations and Regions conference in Cardiff, there was speculation that ITV West and ITV Westcountry could merge news operations, as part of further streamlining of regional operations. Rumours suggested that, while a newsroom (and separate regional identity) would be retained in the south west, the main Westcountry Live programme would move to a studio alongside The West Tonight at ITV West in Bristol (akin to the Meridian and Thames Valley news services at Whiteley). On 12 September 2007, ITV issued a statement to the City of London, saying that it wished to reduce the number of news studios from 17 to just nine. This included merging ITV West with ITV Westcountry to form a non-franchise region, ITV West and Westcountry, from February 2009.

Shortly after the broadcasting regulator OFCOM gave final approval to the changes, the regional news service was phased out with the final broadcast from Plymouth aired on Sunday 15 February 2009. A new programme entitled The West Country Tonight replaced the Westcountry Live on Monday 16 February 2009 but included separate opt-out news bulletins (some of which were pre-recorded depending on the day's news) and weather forecasts for the Westcountry region during the main 6pm programme and in the weekday late bulletin after News at Ten. Separate daytime bulletins for the region were reintroduced in September 2011.

On 14 January 2013, the region became known as ITV West Country. In September 2013, the south west opt-out within the main 6pm news programme ITV News West Country was extended to at least 20 minutes. Separate weekend bulletins were also reintroduced, effectively restoring a full regional news service for the former Westcountry region.

Studios
Westcountry was originally based at Brittany Ferries' offices in Millbay Docks, Plymouth with a view to constructing a purpose-built studio centre on the Plymouth waterfront. However, following the delay caused by TSW's legal proceedings, these plans were scrapped. The company opted instead to convert an industrial unit at Langage Science Park in Plympton, which was backed up by a network of seven local newsrooms and studios in Torbay, Penzance, Truro, Exeter, Barnstaple, Weymouth and Taunton.

Although Westcountry's headquarters were in Plymouth, transmission for the channel was outsourced and run by HTV Wales staff at HTV's presentation centre in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff with continuity announcers based at the Plymouth studios. This arrangement lasted from the first day of broadcasting until shortly after regional continuity was abandoned in October 2002.

Following the merger to form ITV West Country, most of Westcountry's operations were transferred to HTV's West headquarters in Bristol, where production of the regional news service is now based. The only operation left in Plymouth is a newsroom and sales office, alongside two newsrooms in Truro and Exeter.

Sub-regions
Up until early 2009, Westcountry ran four sub-regional services, each providing short opt-out bulletins for their area during the flagship news programme Westcountry Live and the late bulletin after News at Ten. The opt-outs were broadcast from Westcountry's studios in Barnstaple (covering north Devon), Exeter (serving east Devon and parts of Somerset), Plymouth (south Devon & parts of east Cornwall) and Truro (Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly). Westcountry was the first and only ITV company to produce four opt-outs for its region.

Identity
Between 1 January 1993 and 5 September 1999, Westcountry's presentation featured that of a large 'W' shape on a frosted screen over a background video of a nature scene. The idents were made so that the scene could only be seen clearly through the 'W' shape. Accompanying the video was a five-note jingle featuring string and flute instruments. This presentational package lasted throughout the whole period, with the only change on 8 September 1997 that of a form-up added made out of diagonal lines.

From 6 September 1999 however, the look changed drastically, as the Carlton 'Star' ident package was launched on the network. The look, featuring a start up film involving hearts would flash out to reveal the Carlton name over a spinning star background. The Westcountry name was only used on the news programme Westcountry Live. This package lasted until 28 October 2002, when regional continuity was lost.

In its place, a national ITV1 branding package, with local idents featuring the ITV1 logo on the left hand side of the screen with Carlton logo below. This remained until late 2003, when the Carlton name was removed from regional idents, which instead featured four colour cubes randomly located in a scene from the region. The ITV1 logo was located in the bottom right corner with the caption ITV1 for the Westcountry located beneath. Following the 2004 ITV rebranding, the new local ident featured the national ident of three cubes containing the letters 'ITV' above a large cube '1', with the addition of the region name below. A few blunders occurred however. To begin with, Westcountry's local ident had the word West beneath which was later replaced as West Country. The ident was finally amended to show the right name at approximately the same time that regional idents were abandoned. In 2006 and 2009, the Westcountry brand completely disappeared from continuity and the news service respectively. The station would now be known on-air as just ITV1 at all times.

On 14 January 2013, the station's on-air identity was changed to ITV, along with all other ITV plc-owned franchises.

Programmes
Westcountry's programme offerings were primarily aimed at a regional market as opposed to gaining network slots. Westcountry's flagship programme was the regional news magazine Westcountry Live, which ran between Westcountry's launch in 1993 until the merger in 2009. Other regional programmes included:

Bendell at Bedtime – Topical debate (2004)
Birthday People – Birthday slot for children (1993–2005)
Blooming Marvelous – (1994–96)
Brief Encounters – Feature series about unusual pastimes (1993–94)

Little River Journeys – A look at the Westcountry region's waterways, later aired by Channel 4 (1995)
On the Road to the Islands – Jack Pizzey's tour of islands in the south west, later aired by Channel 4 (1993)
Richard Digance: For One Night Only – Local entertainment series (1997–98)
Special Report – current affairs programme
The L.A.D.S. – A rare partly network commission, A magazine programme for men. (1996)
Ruth Meets The Entertainers – (1995) 
The West At Work – (1993–96)
Westcountry Focus – Westcountry's first regular current affairs series
Westcountry Life – Short 30-second films reflecting aspects of life in the region (1993–96)
Westcountry Soccer Night – Local football magazine show (2004–08)
Westcountry Update – Weekly news review for the deaf and hard of hearing (1993–2004)
West Wise – Short-lived inter-town quiz, one of Westcountry's first local programmes (1993)

In its annual reports, the Independent Television Commission (ITC) commented on Westcountry's programming and performance; in 1995 it said that Westcountry had a ""good news service and regional programming"", despite a difficult first year. Two years later in 1997 the ITC again noted its ""strong, high quality regional programming"" and that it had ""scored a major network success with Christmas with the Royal Navy, a series of five live programmes"". In 1999 the ITC again commented that Westcountry provided a ""regional service of generally high quality"" and that overall its range of regional programmes was ""wide and included some strong factual material"", also noting that one of its children's programmes had been supplied to the network.

The organization includes more than 1,900 members accounting for more than 10,000 retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of natural products.

History 

The Natural Products Association was founded in 1936 as the American Health Foods Association (AHFA) to inform consumers
about the benefits of the natural nutrition industry. In 1937, the association changed its name to the Natural Health Foods
Association (NHFA), representing retailers, manufacturers and distributors. In 1943, NHFA was renamed to the National Dietary Foods Association (NDFA). In 1970, NDFA officially became the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA). The organization renamed itself the Natural Products Association or NPA in June 2006. over 650 members today. Its members include suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers representing 10,000 storefronts.

Programs 
The science and regulatory affairs department oversees the association's third-party certification programs.

Natural Seal 
The NPA Natural Seal is described as the first and only natural products certification in the United States. Currently only personal care and home care products and ingredients can be certified. The association requires that certified products must be at least 95 percent natural ingredients or ingredients from natural sources, excluding water. NPA-certified products must use natural ingredients, avoid ingredients with health risks, don't use animal testing, and include biodegradable or recycled material in the packaging. Products also must list all ingredients on the package label, and NPA requires 100 percent natural fragrances and colorants. Certified products are said to appear in more than 85,000 stores nationwide. NPA has certified more than 1,200 products and ingredients since 2008, including well-known brands like Burt's Bees and J.R. Watkins.

GMP Certification 
The Natural Products Association launched the first third-party Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) program for the manufacturing of dietary supplements and ingredients in 1999.

96,14022859,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Documents%20in%20the%20Case,The Documents in the Case,"The Documents in the Case is a 1930 novel by Dorothy L. Sayers and Robert Eustace.  It is the only one of Sayers's twelve major crime novels not to feature Lord Peter Wimsey, her most famous detective character. However, the forensic analyst Sir James Lubbock, who appears or is mentioned in several of the Wimsey novels, also appears in The Documents in the Case.

Plot
This is an epistolary novel, told primarily in the form of letters between some of the characters, using the multiple narrative technique associated with Modernist novelists of the period. This collection of documents—hence the novel's title—is explained as a dossier of evidence collected by the victim's son as part of his campaign to obtain justice for his father.

Novelist John Munting shares, with former public school contemporary and talented painter Harwood Lathom, a rented top floor flat in respectably suburban Bayswater, London. The landlord and downstairs neighbour, Harrison, is a staid, middle-aged widower who has remarried. His new wife Margaret is younger, attractive, passionate and self-absorbed. Lathom and Mrs Harrison begin an affair, the husband suspecting nothing, and Lathom paints a remarkable portrait of her. Creeping downstairs to meet his mistress one night, Lathom encounters the Harrisons' neurotic live-in spinster companion, Agatha Milsom, who mistakes him for Munting in the dark and makes accusations of assault. Faced with Harrison's furious reaction and glad of an excuse to leave a distasteful situation, Munting moves out and marries his fiancée. Lathom departs for Paris and his portrait of Mrs Harrison, exhibited at the Royal Academy, makes his reputation on the London art scene.

Meeting Lathom by chance some time later, Munting is persuaded to accompany Lathom to a remote Devonshire cottage where he is holidaying with Harrison, who is pursuing his hobby of cooking with ingredients available in the wild, and is an expert on edible mushrooms. On arrival they find Harrison hideously dead, apparently having cooked and eaten poisonous fungi by mistake. Returning from Africa, Harrison's engineer son Paul suspects that Lathom and his stepmother have conspired to murder Harrison, and Munting is drawn unwillingly into the investigation. He learns that muscarine – the poison that killed Harrison – in its natural state, differs from synthetic muscarine: all molecules of muscarine are asymmetrical, and differ from their mirror image. Natural muscarine, found in mushrooms, consists purely of one of the two possible forms, but synthetic muscarine is racemic, which means that it consists of a mixture of equal quantities of the molecule as found in nature and its artificial ""mirror-image"" form. The two types of muscarine can be distinguished by using polarized light: when polarized light is shone through a solution of the racemic mixture, the direction of polarization does not change, but when polarized light passes through a solution consisting of only one form of muscarine (or of any such asymmetrical molecule), the direction of polarization rotates as the light passes through the solution. The muscarine consumed by Harrison proves to be synthetic, indicating that the mushrooms he ate were poisoned deliberately by addition of synthetic muscarine stolen from a laboratory. Letters between Mrs Harrison and Lathom indicate that she manipulated him into the killing by claiming that she was expecting his child. Lathom is hanged for murder.

Characters in ""The Documents in the Case""
John Munting – an aspiring young writer
Harwood Lathom – a struggling artist, acquaintance of Munting
George Harrison – middle-aged downstairs neighbour of Lathom and Munting
Margaret Harrison – considerably younger than her husband.  Engaged in a secret affair with Lathom
Agatha Milsom – live-in spinster companion of Mrs Harrison
Paul Harrison – engineer; adult son of Mr Harrison by a previous marriage.

Themes and sources
Dorothy Sayers' co-author, under the pseudonym of Robert Eustace, was Dr Eustace Barton, a physician who also wrote medico-legal thrillers.  Barton suggested to Sayers the scientific theme crucial to the novel's dénouement, which concerns the difference between a naturally produced organic compound and the corresponding synthetic material, and the use of the polariscope to distinguish between them.  He travelled to University College Hospital in August 1928 to consult colleagues and see a practical demonstration of the effect.

As a practising Christian, Sayers was pleased with the religious-scientific theme offered to her by Eustace, which was based on the idea that the asymmetry of living molecules was an indication of the hand of God in creation. This point is made very clear in the lengthy exposition at the local vicar's dinner party, where Munting follows a wide-ranging debate about religion, science and the origin of life. A keen choral singer in her Oxford University years, Sayers introduces at this point the key theme of Haydn's oratorio The Creation.

Having established herself as a successful writer, Sayers intended this book as a departure or experiment, away from the conventional detective story towards the crime novel. In her previous novel Strong Poison she had introduced the character of the crime novelist Harriet Vane as the love interest of her popular amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, and now she omitted Wimsey altogether in a very differently structured and conceived crime novel.

The novel clearly draws upon the notable 1922 Thompson/Bywaters case, which led to the miscarriage of justice whereby Edith Thompson was hanged, along with her lover Frederick Bywaters, for his murder of her husband, supposedly at her instigation, thanks to her fancifully passionate letters offered in evidence at their joint trial. Sayers' presentation of Margaret Harrison (and her letters) in the novel makes an interesting contrast with F. Tennyson Jesse's 1934 novel A Pin to See the Peepshow, similarly based on the Thompson/Bywaters case. Tennyson Jesse's Julia Almond is presented very differently from Sayers' Margaret Harrison.

However, she was ultimately disappointed with the way the book turned out.  ""In my heart,"" she wrote, ""I know I have made a failure of it...  I wish I could have done better with the brilliant plot."".

102,57679873,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inqawe,Inqawe,"Inqawe is the Xhosa term for the traditional smoking pipe used among the Xhosa people. The pipes come in many variations but are mostly made from Acacia caffra or ‘mnyamanzi’ wood which is taken from the hook thorn tree commonly found in the Eastern Cape. Xhosa men and women (including non-smokers) carry a pipe in a beaded tobacco bag called ‘inxili’ as part of their traditional attire when they attend rituals and traditional functions.

The longer smoking pipes are used by senior Xhosa women. These long pipes are called ‘uzalipholile’ meaning ‘it arrives cooled’ which refers to the cooling effect that drawing the smoke through a long stem has. The higher the status of the woman in the community, the longer the stem of her smoking pipe. Xhosa women can have pipes with stems that are up to 30 cm in length.  Younger people of both sexes usually use a slim pipe of medium length. The shorter pipes are smoked by men.

Women and smoking
Xhosa women are allowed to smoke a pipe once they have a child; with each child she bears, the pipe stem is lengthened. It is believed that the pipe used by women is longer so that when the woman breastfeeds, the smoke from the pipe does not go near the baby’s face.

Uses

Pipes in daily use are generally unbeaded while those for rituals and celebrations are beaded. Traditionally when Xhosa people are gathered in groups, it is customary to pass a pipe around for everyone present to have a draw. The tobacco is shared and everyone contributes to the supply. The custom of each person using their own mouthpiece when sharing a pipe is not so much for reasons of hygiene but to prevent witchcraft since it is believed that a person can be bewitched through access to their body substances such as spittle and nail parings.

Pipe styles
Long stemmed pipes: Long stemmed pipes are called ‘inqawe ende’ (meaning long pipe), ‘umngcongo’ ( meaning beautiful object) or ‘umlolombela’ (meaning a long speech) in isiXhosa. The pipe has a removable mouthpiece. Diviners always use this pipe as a symbol of their profession, regardless of their age. 
Modern Xhosa Pipe: This pipe is known as ‘umbhekaphesheya’, which means ‘travelling across the ocean’, is a hybrid between the Xhosa traditional pipe and a European store-bought pipe. This pipe has a permanent mouthpiece and no spur. The bowl of the ‘umbhekaphesheya’ pipe points away from the stem at an angle of 45 degrees, hence the reference to pointing at the sea as the pipes opening is directed towards the sea and its alternative design is influenced by Europeans who travelled across the ocean to reach Africa. This pipe is only used by men.

Tobacco Bags
Tobacco is also called ‘icuba’ by the Xhosa people. The most commonly used tobacco amongst Xhosa people comes from the wild tobacco plant known as Nicotiana glauca. The tobacco is placed in tobacco bags or ‘inxili’  that are worn as a necklace. These bags are part of traditional Xhosa daily dress. Women's bags are made of cotton sheeting decorated with beadwork and braid and a few wool tassels. Those used by men are made from either cotton sheeting or the skin of a goat removed in such a way as to retain its shape. Previously, skins of wild animals such as the hyrax/dassie were also used. Many cloth bags may be carried over a man's stick as a form of ornamentation

Pipe makers
Pipe making among amaXhosa is a specialised craft traditionally practised by men only.
Even though the demand for pipes has decreased in the 21st century, as smoking is becoming less popular, there are still craftsmen who make these pipes. Pipe makers now supplement their income by making wooden spoons and yokes for oxen. Non-smokers also purchase these pipes to put in their homes as ornaments but also as a symbolic link to tradition. Some pipe makers also sell their pipes to curio shops in towns as well as holiday resorts where there is a small demand for traditional Xhosa crafts.

Symbolism
The smoking of the ‘Inqawe’ is a symbol of having a relationship with the ancestors. Therefore, traditional diviners often use it in order to appease the ancestors. Smoking This pipe is used in a number of Xhosa rituals such as the ‘umhlwayelelo’ ritual which is a propitiatory rite for the ‘river people’. During this ritual a small amount of home grown traditional tobacco is  presented to the ancestors by placing it in the water of a river bank. A portion of the same tobacco is kept and smoked symbolically by all the participants, even non-smokers, after the gift giving ceremony at the river.

103,182948,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media%20proprietor,Media proprietor,"A media proprietor, media mogul or media tycoon refers to a successful entrepreneur or businessperson who controls, through personal ownership or via a dominant position in any media related company or enterprise, media consumed by many individuals. Those with significant control, ownership, and influence of a large company in the mass media may also be called a tycoon, baron, or business magnate. Social media creators and founders can also be considered media moguls.

History
In the United States, newspaper proprietors first became prominent in the 19th century with the development of mass circulation newspapers. In the 20th century, proprietorship expanded to include ownership of radio and television networks, as well as film studios, publishing houses, and more recently internet and other forms of multimedia companies. Reflecting this, the term ""press baron"" was replaced by ""media baron"", and the term ""media mogul"" (or ""Hollywood mogul"" when applied to people specifically working in the motion picture industry, having actually spawned a similarly named computer game) was popularized in colloquial English. 

In modern relevance, social media sites need to be taken into account such as Facebook in relation to Mark Zuckerberg who is an extremely important media proprietor. Media and technology play a significant role in mass-media production.

106,6065695,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian%20Forestry%20Corps,Canadian Forestry Corps,"The Canadian Forestry Corps (Corps forestier canadien in French) was an administrative corps of the Canadian Army with its own cap badge, and other insignia and traditions.

The Canadian Forestry Corps was created 14 Nov 1916. The badge of the Canadian Forestry Corps consists of a circle, with a beaver on top, superimposed on a pair of crossed axes, with the text ""Canadian Forestry Corps"" around the edge. At the centre of the circle is a maple leaf with the Imperial State Crown.  Their nickname was the ""Sawdust Fusiliers"".

The Canadian Forestry Corps was disbanded in 1920.  It was reformed in 1940 then disbanded again in 1945.

First World War

The Forestry Corps was created during the First World War when it was discovered that huge quantities of wood were needed for use on the Western Front.  Duckboards, shoring timbers, crates—anything that needed wood had to be provided.  The British government concluded that there was nobody more experienced or qualified in the British Empire to harvest timber than the Canadians. At first the idea was to harvest the trees from Canada's abundant forests and bring them overseas.  But space aboard merchant ships was at a premium, so rather than stuff ships' holds with timber, it was decided to use the Canadians over in Europe, cutting down forests in the UK and France.

Several regiments originally slated for the front lines became military lumberjack units instead.  Canadian troops with their coniferous-tree cap badges identifying them as the Canadian Forestry Corps cut trees in forests in England, Scotland and France, where the timber was squared, sawed and transported.  The CFC also built aerodromes in France for the ever-burgeoning Royal Flying Corps.

Altogether, some 35,000 Canadians served in the Forestry Corps—which eventually was composed of dozens of companies (each composed of several hundred workers).  Although individual troops in emergency situations were sent to fight on the front lines the CFC usually served well back of the fighting.  Occasionally, Forestry Corps units were employed as labour units for the Canadian Corps on the front lines with duties such as stockpiling artillery ammunition, assisting in the quick construction of rail and road systems in the wake of attacking troops, or in helping to evacuate the wounded.

Towards the final two years of the war, more and more Canadian soldiers volunteered for the Forestry Corps, as it was viewed by many as a way to serve the country without facing the German Army in direct conflict.  Many members were underaged volunteers, who had lied about their age in order to be accepted for overseas service, but were below the age of 19 and not legally allowed to serve in combat.  However, the Corps was not without casualties: accidents like those which would occur in a forestry camp in Canada were not uncommon: power saws, machinery and transport all took lives.  Additionally, particularly during the last 100 days of the War, the Forestry Corps was repeatedly combed for volunteers for transfer into the infantry.

War artist Alfred Munnings was invited by the Corps to tour work camps, and he produced drawings, watercolors and paintings, including Draft Horses, Lumber Mill in the Forest of Dreux in France in 1918.  This painting, amongst others, was amongst the forty-five canvasses which were shown at the ""Canadian War Records Exhibition"" at the Royal Academy after war's end.

Second World War
The disbanded Forestry Corps was reinstated for service in the Second World War. They would be deployed to England, but would be working on cutting trees in Scotland and France. The CFC in World War II were only provided basic training and not expect to be in combat roles.

Canadian National War Memorial
The Canadian National War Memorial in Ottawa has a statue figure of a member of the Canadian Forestry Corps upon it near the back of the memorial.  The CFC is largely forgotten today but played an important role in the eventual Allied victory in World War I.

Newfoundland
Newfoundland did not join Canada until 1949 but was at the time a separate Dominion of the British Empire and had its own wartime forestry unit. During World War I the Newfoundland Forestry Battalion was formed on Apr 2 1917, comprising about 500 men. During World War II a unit was formed known as the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit (or NOFU) with about 3,680 men. Many Newfoundlanders stationed in Scotland in the NOFU worked on their education to be eligible for enlistment in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.

The most important reasons stated in the document were that they were not properly informed about the project, which is a violation of ILO convention 169  and the Mexican Constitution (art.2).

Another reason was that they did not see any serious effort in real social development, only some subsidies for cement, tin roofs, chickens, and crops. They suspected that the state of Chiapas and the European Union had hidden interests in the region, and a certain kind of relationschip with its inhabitants. Like previous projects in the region, Prodesis was seen as a counter-insurgency project, designed to divide and rule.

After they had offered the Declaration to the director of Prodesis and the head of the European Delegation in Mexico-City, some of those who signed the declaration were threatened by Prodesis staff: if they would stand by their signature, they would not receive any kind of government support anymore (like oportunidades or procampo).

113,21548088,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Mason%20V,George Mason V,"George Mason V of Lexington (April 30, 1753December 5, 1796) was a planter, businessman, and militia leader. Mason was the eldest son of United States patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention, George Mason IV and his wife Ann Eilbeck. He received his early education from private tutors at Gunston Hall and was given Lexington plantation on Mason's Neck by his father in 1774. In 1775, he named his plantation to commemorate the Battle of Lexington in Massachusetts.

Mason joined the Fairfax County Independent Militia in 1775 and was elected Ensign. He developed a rheumatic disorder that plagued him for the remainder of his life. In 1776, he commanded a militia company sent to Hampton, Virginia to protect the coast from Lord Dunmore's assaults, but was forced to quit the military on account of his increasingly poor health. He travelled to France between 1779 and 1783 for business purposes and to improve his health. At his father's request, George Washington wrote Mason letters of introduction to the marquis de Lafayette and Benjamin Franklin in Paris. While in France, he settled in Nantes, where he became involved in the tobacco trade and occasionally arranged for shipments of goods to his father.

Upon the death of his father in 1792, Mason inherited the entirety of Mason's Neck. He died four years later at Lexington, on December 5, 1796, after suffering from chronic ill health for his entire adult life. He was interred in the Mason family graveyard at Gunston Hall. In 1803, his widow Betsey married George Graham, a nephew of George Mason's second wife, Sarah Brent, who had lived at Gunston Hall and been educated with this Mason's two youngest brothers before completing his education at Columbia University and becoming a lawyer and government official as well as planter.

His will divided Mason's Neck into two approximately equal tracts along a north–south axis from Causeway Point to Martin Cockburn's south boundary line. His eldest son George Mason VI received the eastern tract with the ownership privilege of either Lexington or Gunston Hall, of which he chose the latter. Another of his sons, William Eilbeck Mason, received the western half of the Neck.

Family

Mason married Elizabeth ""Betsey"" Mary Ann Barnes Hooe, daughter of Gerard Hooe and Sarah Barnes of Barnesfield, King George County, on April 22, 1784. They had six children:

Elizabeth Mary Ann Barnes Mason Hooe (March 9, 1785 – March 25, 1827)
George Mason VI (August 11, 1786 – August 21, 1834)
William Eilbeck Mason (February 3, 1788 – November 22, 1820)
Ann Eilbeck Mason Grymes (April 1, 1791 – November 5, 1864)
Sarah Barnes Hooe Mason Stith (May 27, 1794 – September 11, 1877)
Richard Barnes Mason (January 16, 1797 – July 26, 1850)

He was a son of George Mason (1725–1792); nephew of Thomson Mason (1733–1785); first cousin of Stevens Thomson Mason (1760–1803), John Thomson Mason (1765–1824), and William Temple Thomson Mason (1782–1862); father of George Mason VI (1786–1834) and Richard Barnes Mason (1797–1850); uncle of Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838) and James Murray Mason (1798–1871); first cousin once removed of Armistead Thomson Mason (1787–1819), John Thomson Mason (1787–1850), and John Thomson Mason Jr. (1815–1873); and first cousin twice removed of Stevens Thomson Mason (1811–1843).

115,30856377,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%20Euro%20Beach%20Soccer%20League,2007 Euro Beach Soccer League,"The 2007 Euro Beach Soccer League, was the tenth edition of the Euro Beach Soccer League (EBSL), the premier beach soccer competition contested between European men's national teams, occurring annually since its establishment in 1998. The league was organised by Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) between June 29 and August 26, 2007 in six different nations across Europe.

Changes made to the structure of the league in 2006 remained in place for this season. However, there were some notable adjustments to the organisation of Division B – the lower tier season was shortened dramatically to just one round of matches involving all nations and hence was renamed as the Preliminary round for this season.

Spain entered the tournament as defending champions but lost to Portugal in the Superfinal semi-finals. The Portuguese proceeded to win the title, beating France in the final to claim their second European crown, having first won five years prior in 2002. This was France's third runner-up finish in the EBSL and their last top four placing to date.

The league also doubled as the European qualification process for the 2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. The nations finishing in first, second, third and fourth place qualified, along with the winners of the last chance bracket.

Preliminary round (Division B)
Traditionally known as Division B, the lower tier of teams' competition was renamed as the Preliminary round for this season.

The preliminary round took place prior to the Division A season. The event decided which four nations would advance to play in Division A later in the year alongside the top tier's automatic entrants.

For this season, BSWW discarded the traditional multi-stage regular season for lower tier nations. In place of this was organised a single round of matches to decide those to progress to Division A. Since the division consisted of just one stage of fixtures, all 12 teams participated, split into four groups of three, competing in a round robin format.

Unlike in previous years, the overall division table did not determine the successful teams to progress to the next stage of their EBSL campaign. Instead, each of the four group winners secured a place in Division A.

The preliminary round took place in Athens, Greece.

Division A
Following the completion of Division B, Division A commenced.

Division A consisted of four rounds of fixtures known as stages, with one stage hosted in each of the four nations which received automatic entry into the division. All eight teams took part in each stage.

Each stage was played as a straight knockout tournament. All eight teams contesting the stage title started in the quarter-finals, playing one match per round until the final when the winner of the stage was crowned. The losers of the quarter and semi-finals played in consolation matches to determine their final league placements.

Point distribution
Unlike in previous years, points earned by the participating teams for winning matches did not count towards league table. Instead, the system of awarding points established last season in 2006 continued to be used (with minor alterations) – teams earned points for the league table based on their final placement in each stage from 10 points for winning the stage, down to 1 point for finishing last.

The breakdown of the distribution of points is shown in the table below:

The Superfinal took place at the Plages du Prado, Marsielle, France.

The playoff event was organised as a multi-stage tournament; starting with a group stage, the six qualified nations were split into two groups of three, playing in a round robin format. The top two from each group advanced to the semi-finals from which point on the Superfinal was played as a knockout tournament until the winner of the 2007 EBSL was crowned, with an additional match to determine third place.

European nations were granted five berths at the 2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. As Superfinal semifinalists, Portugal, Spain, Russia and France successfully claimed four of these spots. This meant one berth was yet to be filled. This berth was contested in a final round of the 2007 EBSL, independent from the normal proceedings of the league, known as the Last chance bracket. Played as a knockout tournament, parallel to the staging of the Superfinal, Italy won the event and claimed the final World Cup spot.

Reception

AllMusic's Sean Westergaard gave the album a very positive review, writing ""Hypnotic Underworld is a new high-water mark from one of rock's most interesting bands. Highly recommended."" Brandon Stosuy from Pitchfork also praised the album, writing ""Much more could be said, but it's more important to state plainly, in barest terms, that Ghost have emerged as one of the most formidable (and important) rock bands I know. And Hypnotic Underworld is their rollicking masterwork."" Shaking Through called the album ""another worthy addition to the group's idiosyncratic catalog."" Stylus Magazine's Dave Segal, while criticizing the album for meandering too long and Masaki Batoh's vocals, concluded his review with ""Still, I’d rather hear Ghost’s overreaching ambition and exploratory excess than the stunted machinations of most current indie rock.""

119,38043575,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Crabbe%20Cunningham,John Crabbe Cunningham,"John Crabbe Cunningham (1927 – 31 January 1980) was a Scottish climber.  Born in Glasgow, he climbed extensively in the Scottish mountains, where he pioneered new techniques of ice climbing.

For several years, he worked for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) of the British Antarctic Territory (BAT). On 23 November 1964, he became the first to climb Antarctica's Mount Jackson. In 1960–61, he was a member of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, serving as Station Commander at Stonington Island in 1962–63. He was a member of the British Antarctic Survey, and was Station Commander of Adelaide Island in 1964–65. He was also a member of the South Georgia Survey of 1955–56. He died in 1980.

Professional years
During the 1950s and '60s, Cunningham went to New Zealand, India and Antarctica. He wanted to climb to Mount Everest, and in 1953 he had gone to Nepal via India with Hamish MacInnes, also a Scottish mountaineer, to start his climb. However, Hillary and Tenzing had made it to the top of Mount Everest before he could begin.

He then started his career with the British Antarctic Survey. He was the base leader at Adelaide Island. In the 1970s, after he returned to Scotland, he became an instructor at the Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore. In this capacity he perfected innovations in techniques for front point cramponing and use of curved pick ice axes on steep sloping ice. He had used this front point technique while working in Antarctica on icebergs and cliffs with a slope of 70 to 90 degrees. In 1976 he became an instructor at I M Marsh Campus in Liverpool. In 1980, he took his students for practical instruction on climbing to the South Stack sea-cliffs on Anglesey. He drowned at South Stack]] on 31 January 1980, while attempting to rescue a female pupil who fell into the sea while Coasteering. The student survived..

Honors
Cunningham is the namesake of Mount Cunningham () in the Queen Maud Bay at the southern end of South Georgia, His biography, titled Creagh Dhu Climber, the life and times of John Cunningham, was published by Ernest Press.

In 2008, he appeared with a new group, Alain Mion FunKey Combo (with German drummer Michael Kerstin, Swedish bassist Patrik Boman, and a saxophone section consisting of Italian and French musicians: Loïc Soulat on alto, Pietro Tonolo on tenor and Romano Pratesi on baritone) then with his new group Alain Mion & The New Cortex which reunited for concerts at New Morning in 2009-10, with the singer Adeline de Lépinay reprising the role originally performed by Mireille Dalbray on the Troupeau Bleu album.

Filmed in concert and broadcast by Mezzo TV, the group's repertoire included both new and old compositions of Alain Mion, reflected in the new album ""Let's Groove"", released on Trad Vibe Records and presented during a concert in Paris at Petit Journal Montparnasse en 2012.

In the United States, Alain Mion and Cortex's songs have been sampled by several hip-hop artists (including Madlib, Fat Joe, DJ Day, MF DOOM, Wiz Khalifa, Curren$y, Mellowhype,  Tyler The Creator, Rick Ross, and Lupe Fiasco).

Alain Mion's and Cortex's records are often played on contemporary jazz stations such as KCRW in Los Angeles and The Jazz Groove Radio in San Francisco.

Mallik is noted as a nationalist intellectual who was one of the co-founders of the Bengal National College, of which he was the principal financial supporter. He was close to Aurobindo Ghosh and financed the latter's nationalist publications including Bande Mataram.

Mallik was born in Pataldanga suburb of Calcutta to Prabodh Chandra Basu Mallik. He graduated from St. Xaviers College Calcutta and Presidency College Calcutta before enrolling in fine arts at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1900.

He returned from England before completing his university studies, and immediately delved into the nationalist movement. His palatial house in what was then Wellington square in Calcutta became a major hub of political activity. In 1906, Mallik was among a group of leading luminaries of Bengal who founded the National Council for Education to promote indigenous and nationalist education in higher education. His donated Rs 100,000 to support the founding of the Bengal National College. He also founded the Life of Asia Insurance Company. Mallik's political activities earned him the ire of the Raj, and he was deported in 1908 in the wake of the Alipore Bomb Conspiracy. Mallik's nationalist work and generous support of the movement earned him the colloquial title of Raja from his grateful countrymen. 

In independent India, Wellington Square, the site of his palatial residence, was renamed Raja Subodh Mallik Square, while the road housing Jadavpur University, which emerged from the Bengal National College, is now called Raja Subodh Mallik Road.

128,36969028,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calumet%20Photographic,Calumet Photographic,"Calumet Photographic, Inc., often shortened to Calumet Photo and formerly known as Calumet Manufacturing Company, is a photographic retail and photofinishing specialty store, originally headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. In 2012, the company owned and operated a chain of 32 locations worldwide. The company had 15 locations in the United States, 8 in the United Kingdom, 6 in Germany, 2 in the Netherlands and 1 in Belgium, with 200 employees and an annual revenue of $10 million.

On March 12, 2014, Calumet Photographic filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. C&A Marketing, the New Jersey-based owners of a number of retail photo brands including Ritz Camera, Wolf Camera, Inkley's, Camera World, and RitzPix, purchased the US-based assets on May 1, 2014 for $4 million.

On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it would reopen its Oak Brook, Illinois, retail store location, and did so on May 11; it served as the anchor for the brand. The final three stores closed in January 2016.

History
In 1939, Kenneth Becker founded the sporting goods store Calumet Manufacturing Company that sold an occasional camera in Chicago. After several years of manufacturing darkroom equipment, in 1955 the company bought the rights to Kodak's Master View 4x5 camera, enabling Kodak to leave the view camera business. In the 1960s, the company innovated the Caltar large format lens line, the C-2 roll film holder and the nitrogen burst film and print processors.

In 1980, the company transitioned from being a large format proprietary product vendor to being a full-line photographic product supplier. In 1983, the company left the view camera manufacturing business and outsourced production to the Netherlands. In 1989, Calumet made a notable improvement on Polaroid instant film technology. In 1992, the company leased  of office space in Bensenville, Illinois, and relocated its corporate headquarters. 

In the 1990s, Calumet acquired the United Kingdom photo retail chain Keith, Johnson and Pelling and by early 2009, the company had 20 locations in Europe. In 2007, the retail location in Bensenville was moved next to the Oakbrook Center shopping mall in Oak Brook, Illinois. In February 2012, the company acquired the three remaining Washington, DC, area Penn Camera locations after a United States bankruptcy court ruling following Penn Camera's elimination of 5 of its 8 locations. In October 2012, the company opened three new locations in Maryland, Florida and Illinois following the bankruptcy and liquidation of Ritz Camera. , the company's headquarters were located on West Bliss Street in Chicago.

Calumet stores hosted free classes, seminars and demonstrations in dedicated spaces.

On March 13, 2014, the following was posted on the company's Facebook page: ""After 75 years of business it is with a heavy heart that we announce our immediate closing in the United States (our European stores will continue). It has been a joy to share our passion for photography with you all of these years. We'll miss each other and we'll miss all of our customers. Thank you for everything.""  At the same time their website and Twitter account also went offline. Shortly after, the same message was posted on the locked doors of the closed stores.  According to Crain's Chicago Business, the company filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy after a lender opted not to continue its financing.

In April 2014, some of the principals bid on the inventory, store leases and other assets. On May 2, C&A Marketing acquired most of the assets and announced plans to reopen both calumetphoto.com and the equipment rental business. Less than one week later, the C&A announced that it would reopen the Oak Brook, Illinois location on May 11.

In January 2016 C&A Marketing closed all remaining Calumet locations in the United States.

European operations
The 2014 bankruptcy of the U.S. branch had no direct impact on Calumet Photographic's operations in the UK and mainland Europe, where all stores continue trading as normal.

Following the growth of the camera rental market, Calumet Photographic UK launched a dedicated rental website to feature rental equipment and allow customers to reserve equipment. In 2014, the UK brand won a Gold Retailer award for customer service from Amateur Photographer and What Digital Camera. In March 2015, the Calumet Student Photographer Of The Year award program was launched in partnership with photographic brands including Canon Inc and Manfrotto.

On June 7, 2016, mid-market investment firm Aurelius announced that it had acquired Calumet International Ltd., a holding company comprising both the Calumet Photographic brand and professional lighting producer Bowens Lighting. Calumet Photographic's physical presence, in July 2016, comprised 9 branches in the UK, 6 in Germany, 2 in the Netherlands and 1 in Belgium.

On March 3, 2017, Aurelius announced it had acquired competing UK company Wex Photographic, and the two companies would be merged. In September 2017 they announced the two businesses would be rebranded in the UK as Wex Photo Video and a new London store opened, the largest in the UK.

129,287183,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhatrapati%20Shivaji%20Maharaj%20International%20Airport,Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport,"Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport ( ) is the primary international airport serving Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It is the second busiest airport in the country in terms of total and international passenger traffic after Delhi, and was the 14th busiest airport in Asia and 41st busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic in calendar year 2019. Its passenger traffic was about 49.8 million in year 2018. It is also the second busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic. In March 2017, the airport surpassed London's Gatwick Airport as the world's busiest to operate a single runway at a time. This was later surpassed again by Gatwick Airport at the end of 2019 due to passenger numbers falling at Mumbai. The airport's IATA code BOM is associated with ""Bombay"", the city's former legal name.

The airport has two operating terminals spread over a total land area of  and handles about 950 aircraft movements per day. It handled a record 1,007 aircraft movements on 9 December 2018, higher than its earlier record of 1,003 flight movements in a day in June 2018. It handled a record 51 movements in one hour on 16 September 2014. Along with IGI Delhi, it was adjudged the ""World's Best Airport"" at Airport Service Quality Awards 2017 in the highest category of airports handling more than 40 million passengers annually by Airports Council International. It has also won the ""Best Airport in India and Central Asia"" award at the Skytrax 2016 World Airport Awards. It is one of the three airports in India to have implemented Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) to ensure timely takeoffs and landings. In financial year 2020, the Mumbai Airport handled 45.87 million passengers, only second to IGI's 67.3 million in India.

The airport is operated by Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), a Joint Venture between the Airports Authority of India and the GVK Industries Ltd led consortium which was appointed in February 2006 to carry out the modernisation of the Airport. The new integrated terminal T2 was inaugurated on 10 January 2014 and opened for international operations on 12 February 2014. A dedicated six lane, elevated road connecting the new terminal with the main arterial Western Express Highway was also opened to the public the same day.

The airport is named after the 17th-century Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, having been renamed in 1999 from the previous ""Sahar Airport"" to ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport"" (the title ""Maharaj"" was inserted on 30 August 2018). It is situated across the suburbs of Santacruz and Sahar Village in Vile Parle East. The airport is awarded as the best airport in Asia-Pacific in 2020 (over 40 million passengers per annum) by Airports Council International.

History

RAF Santacruz was constructed in the 1930s. It was a bigger airfield than nearby Juhu Aerodrome and was home to several RAF squadrons during World War II from 1942 to 1947. The Airport covered an area of about  and initially had three runways. The apron existed on the south side of runway 09/27, and the area, referred to today as the ""Old Airport"", houses, among others, maintenance hangars of Air India, Air Works India, Indamer Aviation Pvt Ltd, and MIAL's General Aviation Terminal.

By 1946, when the RAF began the process of handing over the airfield to the Director General of Civil Aviation for Civil operations, two old abandoned hangars of the Royal Air Force had been converted into a terminal for passenger traffic. One hangar was used as a domestic terminal and the other for international traffic. It had counters for customs and immigration checks on either side and a lounge in the center. Air India handled its passengers in its own terminal adjoining the two hangars. In its first year, it handled six civilian services a day.

Traffic at the airport increased after Karachi was partitioned to Pakistan and as many as 40 daily domestic and foreign services operated by 1949, prompting the Indian Government to develop the airport, equipping the airport with a night landing system comprising a Radio range and a modernised flare path lighting system Construction of a new passenger terminal and apron began in 1950 and was commissioned in 1958. Named after the neighbourhood in which it stood and initially under the aegis of the Public Works Department, the new airport was subsequently run by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

With the dawning of the jumbo jet era in the 1970s, Santacruz, despite several extensions, began suffering from insufficient operational capacity.
The Santacruz terminal was designed to accommodate 600 passengers at any given time, but by the late 1970s, it was handling 1,200. In 1979–80, 5 million domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Santa Cruz compared with 3 million at Delhi's Palam Airport. The airlines were constantly expanding their services but there was no corresponding increase in space at the terminal, making it the most congested airport in the country. In one of its issues, Time magazine, referring to the chaos, called the terminal building a ""black hole"".
A major fire gutted the International section of the terminal building on 21 September 1979, killing three passengers and shutting down the airport. A temporary departure extension or ""Gulf Terminal"" was made functional in October that year until the terminal was repaired.

The Tata committee, set up in 1967 to examine the issues concerning the airport, had recommended the construction of a new international terminal to meet the requirements of traffic in the seventies. The Santa Cruz terminal was to be used for domestic traffic alone. The International Airport Authority of India (IAAI), which was set up in 1972, started planning the construction of a new terminal building for handling international passenger traffic, to be completed by 1981. Accordingly, construction of the new international terminal at Sahar to the northeast of Santacruz in Vile Parle was taken up at an estimated cost of  110 million.
Construction of the new international terminal at Sahar began in November 1977, and the first phase took three years to build. Sahar Terminal 2A, the first phase of the three-part terminal, was opened on 5 December 1980.

AAI had been considering the modernisation of Bombay Airport in 1996 although the AAI board approved a modernisation proposal only in 2003. By then, Bombay and Delhi airports were handling 38% of the country's aircraft movement and generating one-third of all revenues earned by AAI. At that time, the Bombay airport handled 13.3 million passengers, 60% of which were domestic travellers. The airport faced severe congestion for both aircraft and passengers as it was handling twice as many aircraft movements per day than it was originally designed for. The bidding process for its modernisation eventually began in May 2004 with the decision by the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) was announced in January 2006.

Ownership
A consortium of GVK Industries Ltd, Airports Company South Africa, and Bidvest, won the bid to manage and operate CSIA. To accomplish this task, Mumbai International Airport Private Limited (MIAL), a joint venture between the consortium (74%) and the Airports Authority of India (26%) was formed. Since then, MIAL has made several improvements in the aesthetics, design and passenger conveniences at CSIA including the refurbishment of domestic terminals 1A & 1B, international terminals 2B & 2C, and the opening of a brand new domestic terminal 1C and new Terminal T2. MIAL also undertook airside improvement projects such as the commissioning of new taxiways, aprons and the reconstruction of both runways. In February 2008, MIAL entered into an agreement with Air Transport IT specialist SITA that led to CSIA becoming the first airport in India to Implement Common-use self-service Kiosks and CUTE (Common Use Terminal Equipment) check-in systems.

In February 2021, the Adani Group acquired both GVK and Bidvest's stakes in MIAL, giving it a controlling interest in the venture.

Structure

Runways
The airport has two intersecting runways and it handles an average of 980 flights per day. The runways have been upgraded to Code F, which means they can accommodate larger aircraft like the Airbus A380. Following a presentation in March 2011 by UK's air traffic service provider NATS on how the capacity of the airport can be increased, MIAL set a target of 48 aircraft movements an hour in an effort to reduce congestion at the airport. Both runways were operated simultaneously especially during peak hours to try and attain this target. MIAL scrapped simultaneous Cross-runway flight operations in mid-2013 after it found that single runway operations were more effective for increasing aircraft movements per hour. Runway 14/32 was henceforth to be used only when the main runway was unavailable due to maintenance or other reasons. The construction of new rapid exit taxiways helped in increasing flight handling capacity from 32 movements per hour to 44 in 2012. NATS delivered and helped MIAL implement a 'change roadmap' to help CSMIA achieve more than 50 movements per hour in 2015.
The increased air-side efficiencies resulted in CSMIA overtaking Gatwick Airport in March 2017 to become the world's busiest airport with only one operational runway at a time.

Runway notes

Once the longest commercial runway in India, Runway 09/27 is the airport's main runway. 13 taxiways, including four rapid exit taxiways, connect it to a full-length parallel taxiway to its north. It intersects the secondary runway south of the terminal buildings. The reconstruction of the runway started in September 2010 and was completed in May 2011. The runway width was increased from  to  with a runway shoulder width of 7.5 m added on each side. The ILS on 27 starts at  and is  long with a glide slope path of 3°.

Runway 14/32 has ten taxiways including three rapid exit taxiways that connect to a parallel taxiway running along its eastern flank. It runs between Terminals 1 and 2 and was reconstructed in 2010. The runway shoulders were widened from . The associated taxiways of secondary runway were upgraded in 2019. A new rapid exit taxiway and the conversion of taxiways to Code-F effectively increased the capacity of the runway. In 2020, the secondary runway set a record of 47 movements per hour during peak hour traffic as compared to 36 movements per hour.

Issues with utilising 14/32 are:
 Trombay Hill, lies  away from the 32 end, an approach that was temporarily made a No-Fly zone because the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) nuclear complex at Trombay (Anushakti Nagar) lies within its flight path.

MIAL was considering constructing a second parallel runway as part of its master plan. However, the construction of this runway would necessitate a large-scale relocation of either Air India's hangars and maintenance facilities or the airport's flight kitchens and the Sahar police station, among others, depending on its alignment. The parallel runway remains an active part of the expansion plan but in the meantime the cross runway is being upgraded as much as possible.

Air traffic control tower

India's second tallest air traffic control tower with a height of  after Delhi airport (101.9 m) stands in a section of the parking area opposite terminal 1B. The triangular three-dimensional structure with soft vertices that won the Hong Kong Building Information Modelling (BIM) Award for the year 2009, has six storeys commencing from . The tower was inaugurated on 18 October 2013 and took over operations on 1 January 2014.

From the new tower, air traffic controllers are able to see  beyond the thresholds of both runways. The tower and its associated technical block and mechanical plant building cover a total of . The cost of the fully equipped tower is estimated at 4 billion.

The previous ATC tower, built by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at an overall project cost of about ₹2.80 billion, was functional from 1999 to 2013. During that period, many airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Saudi, Qantas and United avoided landing at Mumbai airport when the secondary runway was in use as the ATC tower was too close to the runway and not in compliance with ICAO standards. The tower penetrated runway 14/32's transitional obstacle limitation surfaces by over 50 metres (for instrument approaches). The tower also obstructed the path of a parallel taxiway under construction for the secondary runway. MIAL demolished the tower in 2014.

Terminals
The airport has two terminals for scheduled commercial passenger services: Terminal 1 at Santacruz for domestic flights and Terminal 2 at Sahar for both international and domestic flights. While both terminals use the same airside facilities, they are physically separated on the cityside, requiring a 15–20-minute (landside) drive between them. A dedicated General Aviation Terminal caters to passengers using private and non-scheduled flight operations.

Currently operational terminals

Terminal 1
Terminal 1, locally known as Santacruz Airport, is used for domestic flights primarily operated by low-cost carriers. This was the original Santacruz building that was Mumbai's first passenger terminal which was once integrated, however was renamed Terminal 1 after the opening of the Sahar building for international operations and became a domestic operations terminal. It was refurbished several times over the decades, the most recent being during the 2000s. It was further divided into Terminals 1A, 1B, and 1C after their permanent closure during the course of late 1990s and early 2000s. It was used by SpiceJet, GoAir, and IndiGo, but after Jet Airways dissolved on 17 April 2019, select flights from all the Terminal 1B airlines moved into the newer T2 building. The terminal has 11 passenger boarding bridges. MIAL renamed Terminal 1B to T1 in January 2017 to help fliers identify it easily. Several airlines operate airconditioned Cerita buses owned by BEST to ferry passengers between the terminal and aircraft.

Terminal 2

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) was awarded the contract to construct the new Terminal 2, better known as T2, in order to differentiate it from the older Terminal 2 building. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) was the architectural designer of the project. SOM also provided the schematic design of structure and MEP and the detailed structural design of the roof. Detailed design of the foundations and the rest of the structure and civil works, the MEP, IT, and airport systems, including the full construction documentation of the project was carried out by L&T's in-house design team, EDRC (Engineering Design and Research Center). The terminal covers a land area of 210,000 square metres and has replaced the previous International Terminal (which has already been demolished). The entire project was estimated to cost  and employ over 12,000 workers.
The X-shaped terminal has a total floor area of 450,000 square metres across four floors and handles both domestic and international passengers. It includes new taxiways and apron areas for aircraft parking designed to cater to 40 million passengers annually. The structure has boarding gates on two piers extending southwards from a central processing building featuring a 42-metre high roof employing over 20,000 metric tonnes of fabricated steel covering 30 acres. However, the eastern pier of T2 remains truncated due to non-clearance of slums in the adjoining plot, giving an asymmetrical look when seen from above. The new T2 building operates Multiple Aircraft Ramp System (MARS) stands and swing gates, so that a single stand can accommodate either one wide body aircraft or two narrow body aircraft, in either domestic or international configuration. The new terminal is connected by the six-lane Sahar Elevated Access Road to the Western Express Highway. A metro rail link to the terminal is under construction.

The new terminal has around 21,000 square meters of retail space, lounges and travel services, over 5,000 square meters of landscaping and a multi level car park for 5,000 cars. The parking Management System and Revenue control system for the entire MLCP has been designed and supplied by SKIDATA. It has 192 check-in counters and 60 immigration counters for departing passengers, and 14 baggage carousels and 76 immigration counters for arriving passengers. To transfer passengers across its four levels, the building has 48 escalators and 75 elevators. The terminal also features 42 travelators.
In the initial phase of development, the apron adjoining T2 provides a total of 48 stands including 3 Code F stands (for the A380). In the final phase of development a total of 38 Code E/F contact stands, 14 Code E/F remote stands and 20 Code C remote stands are provided (total 72 stands).

The GVK Lounge, the first common luxury lounge at an airport in India, opened in November 2014. The lounge is open to First class and Business class travellers and can accommodate 440 guests at a time. It is spread over 30,000 square feet across two levels of the terminal and has a library, a business centre and fine-dining options, apart from the usual facilities like concierge services, smoking zone, food and beverage, bar, luxury spa, shower area and a relaxation area. The luxury lounge has won the 'World's Leading Airport Lounge – First Class 2015' award at the World Travel Awards 2015 held in Morocco.

The terminal also houses the Niranta Airport Transit Hotel and the 32-room hotel is the first of its kind in the country. It is located on Level 1 of the terminal and rooms may be booked by passengers who have checked into the airport. IWG plc, operating under the brand Regus operates a shared workspace out of the terminal.

The old international terminal was closed permanently at 13:00 on 12 February 2014, and international operations from the new terminal commenced from the same day. The first arrival was Air India flight 343 (an Airbus A330-200) from Singapore via Chennai, and the first departure was Jet Airways flight 118 (a Boeing 777-300ER) to London. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh. The domestic operations at T2 were launched on 9 January 2015, with the inaugural flight of Vistara arriving from Delhi. Vistara initially operated from level 4 of the terminal, which is being used only by international passengers, but in July 2015, they shifted to level 3, which will be used only for domestic operations. Air India shifted all its domestic operations from Terminal 1B to T2 on 1 October 2015 making it the second airline to operate domestic flights from the T2 Terminal, to ease their International and Domestic passenger transfers, and Jet Airways shifted its domestic operations to T2 on 15 March 2016, facilitating a seamless transfer experience for its passengers, whereas all other domestic airlines, namely Indigo, GoAir, and SpiceJet, took place, both departure and arrival, at the older Santacruz building.

After the demise of Jet Airways on 17 April 2019, other carriers launched additional domestic flights using slots vacated by Jet Airways. These flights were operated from T2. This arrangement resulted in the larger carriers having to operate domestic flights from both terminals. Hence, MIAL moved to streamline operations at both terminals in September 2019, shifting all domestic operations of Air Asia India, IndiGo, and GoAir back to T1, while SpiceJet moved all of its domestic operations to T2.

Car Parking and Passenger Arrivals
All vehicles arriving at T2 to pick up arriving passengers are routed via the Multi-Level Car Park and are charged a fee to counter traffic congestion at the airport. Four wheelers are charged a minimum fee of  for 30 minutes in general parking and two-wheelers  for 240 minutes.

General Aviation Terminal
CSIA's General Aviation Terminal for private and non-scheduled flight operators (NSOPs) is located at Kalina on the south-west side of the airfield. The terminal was approved for international operations in April 2011, making CSMIA the first airport in India to have a self-contained terminal for handling round the clock domestic and international flight operations for private and NSOPs. The terminal offers facilities for passengers departing and arriving on private aircraft and business jets. The terminal has two exclusive lounges, two conference halls, two crew restrooms and a café bar.

Previous terminals

Terminal 1A, 1B, and 1C
When the Sahar terminal was opened in the 1980s, the terminal at Santacruz reverted to being a domestic terminal. The terminal consisted of three structures, Terminals 1A, 1B, and 1C.
 Terminal 1A - It was opened in April 1992, and was used solely by Indian Airlines (now Air India). In 2005, Kingfisher Airlines also began operating from 1A, after it entered into an agreement to source all ground handling and terminal space from Indian Airlines. In June 2013, shortly after Kingfisher ceased operations, MIAL allocated the vacant space to GoAir. From 1 October 2015, Air India moved all of its Terminal 1A operations to the new Terminal 2. GoAir moved its departure operations to Terminal 1B on that same date, resulting in the closure of the Terminal 1A departures level. GoAir, however, continued to use Terminal 1A's arrivals level until 15 March 2016 when its arrivals were also shifted to Terminal 1B and Terminal 1A was shut.
 Terminal 1B - This was the original Santacruz building that was Mumbai's first passenger terminal which was once integrated, however was renamed Terminal 1 after the opening of the Sahar building for international operations and became a domestic operations terminal.
 Terminal 1C - It was built at a cost of  3 billion and opened in April 2010. Architectural design was provided by Hafeez Contractor. EDRC, the in-house design unit of the EPC contractor Larsen & Toubro (L&T) performed the Structural, MEP and IT / Airport systems design. The terminal had six passenger boarding bridges and allowed connectivity between Terminals 1A and 1B. It was spread over 297,194 sq ft across three levels and had a seating capacity of about 900 passengers. Level 1 housed the offices of MIAL and some airlines, Level 2 comprised the security-hold area for passengers after checking in at either Terminal 1A or 1B. Level 3 accommodated a food court. The building served as a boarding-only facility for all airlines. Passengers entered this facility via Terminal 1B.

In January 2017, MIAL renamed the Terminal 1B as T1.

Old Terminal 2 (Divided into 2A, 2B, and 2C)

Terminal 2 of the airport is located at Sahar Village, in Vile Parle East. Designed by Aéroports de Paris and opened in January 1981, Terminal 2 was built in three modular phases as Terminals 2A, 2B, and 2C. Each module had a capacity of 2.5 million passengers. This terminal had an area of .
The terminal structure was laid out in a space-saving vertical arrangement with separate levels for arrivals and departures. An overpass on the city-side took passengers to the upper level departure forecourt.

The original terminal was a convex shaped single concourse building with 14 Code E contact stands. The greater T2 apron also provided a further 15 Code D/E and 6 Code C remote stands. This gave a total of 35 stands on the existing apron.
The departures section of 2A had 42 check-in counters, 18 more than in the international section at the Santacruz terminal. After completing customs and immigration formalities, the departing travellers were led down to a mezzanine floor where five elongated nodules connect the terminal with the aircraft via aerobridges.

 Terminal 2A - This first phase of the terminal complex was completed at a cost of  and it served most international carriers. Its boarding gates 3 to 8 were the first aerobridges installed in the subcontinent. It was decommissioned and demolished in January 2009 to make way for the new T2 structure.
 Terminal 2B - It costed  and was completed in 1984. It served Air India and carriers handled by Air India between September 1986 and October 1999 and was decommissioned when Terminal 2C opened. It was extensively refurbished and made operational once again following the demolition of Terminal 2A.
 Terminal 2C - Inaugurated in October 1999, it was originally and exclusively for Air India, Air India Express and those carriers whose ground operations were handled by Air India.

Terminals 2B and 2C were decommissioned in February 2014 when the new T2 took over operations. They were demolished later that year, so that the remainder of the new T2 could be completed.

Cargo
The Air Cargo Complex, located west of the international passenger Terminal 2, has been in operation since 1977. The cargo apron is capable of handling five wide-bodied aircraft. In 2009–10, the airport handled 385,937 metric tonnes of International Cargo and 165,252 metric tonnes of Domestic Cargo. Air India (AI) and Mumbai International Airport Pvt Ltd (MIAL) have been appointed as custodians of cargo by the Central Board of Excise and Customs at Mumbai. The Cargo Terminal has a Centre for Perishable Cargo (CPC) with an area of 1844 m2 for perishable and temperature sensitive international export shipments, strong rooms of 115 m2 for storage of valuable cargo and storage areas for dangerous goods in both import and export warehouses, dedicated Unaccompanied Baggage handling and clearance areas and 9 coloured X-ray cargo screening machines for export cargo.

Apart from handling 65% of the international volumes at CSIA, MIAL also operates a Common User Domestic Cargo Facility. After taking over the redevelopment work of the airport in 2006, MIAL commissioned an offshore Common User Terminal (CUT) near the Marol pipeline as a temporary arrangement. In June 2016, MIAL opened a new domestic cargo CUT near the Western Express Highway in Vile Parle.

The CUT has been outsourced to Concor Air Ltd. on a Build-operate-transfer basis. The terminal has the capacity to handle 300,000 metric tonnes of cargo annually and is built on an area of 60,000 square feet. The Cargo Terminal is an ""elevated terminal structure"" where all arriving domestic cargo is managed from the basement level while departing cargo is handled at the upper level. Air India and Blue Dart handle their own domestic cargo operations at their own terminals.
Blue Dart opened its dedicated cargo facility at Mumbai airport near Terminal 1 on 7 February 2019. The facility measures 4,300 square meters and has air-side and city-side access, allowing for faster transfer of shipments.

Statistics

Connectivity
 Vile Parle is a railway station on the Western line and Harbour line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network closest to both T1 and T2 of the airport.
 Airport Road and Marol Naka are the stations on Line 1 of the Mumbai Metro system closest to Terminal T2.
 Western Express Highway (WEH) is the station on Line 1 of the Mumbai Metro system closest to Terminal T1.

The Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST) operates air-conditioned buses to the Airport from Andheri railway station. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) runs bus services to the Airport from various nodes of Navi Mumbai.

Upcoming airport metro stations

Line 3 of the Mumbai Metro will run underground from Cuffe Parade to SEEPZ and serve CSMIA via three stations – one each at the Santacruz and Sahar terminals and one in the GVK SkyCity. It will reduce the commute time between Colaba and the airport to 40 minutes.

In early 2012, the MMRDA held talks with MIAL to either construct or finance the construction of three of the line's stations. MIAL agreed to bear the cost of constructing the three stations, expected to total  777 crore, because of the potential increase in passenger convenience. However, CSIA placed conditions before MMRDA for the corridor;
 The metro line should operate twenty-four hours a day in order to serve passengers of international flights scheduled at odd hours.
 A provision be made for a check-in facility at all metro stations.

MIAL specified that the commercial rights of the three stations it constructs will fully rest with the authority, and that revenue earned from any commercial activity on the premises would go to MIAL. It would undertake the design and civil construction of the stations, costing  600 crore, on its own, and would pay the estimated cost of electromechanical equipment (around  177 crore) to MMRDA in three equal instalments over three years.

Line 7A is an extension of the  long 'Red Line' that will connect to T2.
The line will have an underground station at CSMIA.
Civil work on this line began in early 2020 and is to be completed by December 2021.

The MMRDA has also planned a line between CSMIA and the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport.

131,10667502,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun%20%281960s%20band%29,Gun (1960s band),"The Gun were a late 1960s British rock guitar trio who had a single British Top Ten hit, ""Race with the Devil"" and recorded two albums before disbanding.  The band included brothers Paul Gurvitz and Adrian Gurvitz.

History
The Gun were renamed in 1967 from The Knack, formed by guitarist/vocalist Paul Gurvitz (born Paul Anthony Gurvitz, 6 July 1944, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire - he was known by the surname Curtis until the early 1970s after which he returned to his original name Gurvitz). The Knack changed their name in the spring/summer of 1966, and the setup was Paul Curtis (Gurvitz) on guitar and vocals, Louie Farrell (born Brian John Farrell, 8 December 1947, Goodmayes, Essex)  (who had joined The Knack in mid 1966) on drums, Gearie Kenworthy on bass guitar (born 17 October 1946), Tim Mycroft organ (born 1949, Purewell, Christchurch, Dorset died 1 January 2010), and later for a short while, Jon Anderson of Yes. Gun performed at the UFO Club, supporting bands such as Pink Floyd, Arthur Brown and Tomorrow. Recording sessions at Olympic Studios produced the unreleased single ""Lights on the Wall"", while in November 1967 they recorded for the BBC alternative music radio programme Top Gear and twice played on air. In early 1968 the band changed its line-up to a trio, with Paul Curtis (Gurvitz) on bass, Louie Farrell on drums and Adrian Curtis (Gurvitz) on guitar.

After being signed to CBS Records in early 1968, the band scored a hit with the opening track from their eponymous album (1968), ""Race with the Devil"". Issued as a single in October 1968, it reached the top 10 in the UK Singles Chart, number 35 on the Australian Singles Chart and number 1 in many UK territories in March 1969. Jimi Hendrix quoted the song's riff during his song ""Machine Gun"" at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, as did Status Quo on their song ""Forty Five Hundred Times"" during a stage show at Apollo Theatre in Glasgow in 1976. ""Race with the Devil"" has been covered by Judas Priest ((1977) on the 2001 remastered CD version of Sin After Sin), Black Oak Arkansas (on their 1977 album Race with the Devil), Girlschool (on their 1980 album Demolition), and Church of Misery (on their 1996 demo, released as a split album with Acrimony, and on their full-length LP Vol. 1).

Their debut album's cover is noteworthy as it was the first by Roger Dean (credited as ""W. Roger Dean"" on the back of the sleeve). AllMusic described it as having a ""distinctive psych-flavoured proto-metal"" sound. Their second album, Gunsight was released in 1969.

Despite releasing a number of other singles, and an attempt by their record label to identify them with the underground counter-culture, the band had no further hits.

Aftermath
After a short time working separately, the Gurvitz brothers formed Three Man Army in 1971 and recorded three albums.

Between 1974 and 1976, Three Man Army became the Baker Gurvitz Army with Ginger Baker, the former drummer for Cream, in the line-up. The trio recorded three albums: Baker Gurvitz Army, Elysian Encounter and Hearts On Fire. During the same period, the Gurvitz brothers recorded two albums under the name The Graeme Edge Band, with drummer Graeme Edge of The Moody Blues: Kick Off Your Muddy Boots and Paradise Ballroom. It was not a touring band, and also featured Baker.  Paul Gurvitz latterly toured as the Paul Gurvitz and the New Army.

Biography
Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Jr. was the son of Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Sr. (1814–1901), a U.S. Coast Survey topographer, and the former Elizabeth Clapp Porter.  After graduating from Harvard University in 1876, he studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, then worked as senior draftsman in Henry Hobson Richardson's office.

Career
After Richardson's death in 1886, Longfellow teamed up with Frank Ellis Alden (1859–1908) and Alfred Branch Harlow (1857–1927) to found the firm of Longfellow, Alden & Harlow, with offices in Boston and Pittsburgh. The firm designed the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and the City Hall in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They also designed the Arnold Arboretum headquarters, the Hunnewell Building, in 1892 which was constructed with funds donated by philanthropist-horticulturalist Horatio Hollis Hunnewell in 1903.

Longfellow later moved to Boston, where he worked in association with his cousin, William Pitt Preble Longfellow (1836–1913). He designed several structures around Harvard, including the Brattle Theatre, the Phillips Brooks House, the Semitic Museum, the Bertram and Eliot Halls at Radcliffe College, and chemical laboratories.

He also designed the Washington Street Elevated, the Theodore Parker Church in West Roxbury, the Merrill Memorial Library in Yarmouth, ME, the Curtis Memorial Library in Brunswick, ME and a Maine Historical Society library building. He served on the board of directors of the Dedham Pottery company and designed their plant.

Longfellow also designed and built Eliestoun, a large shingle-style summer home, rare in the midwest. Eliestoun was completed in 1890 and is on the Principia College campus in Elsah, Illinois.

Works

Interests
Longfellow was one of the founders of The Society of Arts and Crafts of Boston, active in the Boston Marine Museum, and a trustee of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Boston Athenæum.

The ground floor is composed of rusticated blocks and recessed arched windows. The entrance is reached by a flight of stairs and a protruding portico. Two small windows frame either side of the entrance.

The county's first courthouse and jail were completed in 1819, occupying the site of the present buildings; two later courthouses and one later jail were constructed on the same site before giving way to its present occupants.  Both buildings are masonry, the courthouse being a stone Neo-Renaissance structure, and the sheriff's-residence-and-jail being a brick Queen Anne building.  A central tower distinguishes the courthouse from the surrounding commercial district, while smaller architectural features include columns in the form known as distyle in antis.  Typical of its style, the jail lacks a uniform shape, its roof reflecting the asymmetrical floor plan.  Pilasters divide the facade of the courthouse into five bays, and the side into ten, while a prominent belt course divides the first and second stories.  A large clock is set into the tower, with a pillared cupola set above.  Behind the courthouse, the jail is distinguished by the steep conical roof covering its two-story tower; while the base of the roof sits at the same level as the middle of the courthouse's second-story windows, the conical roof rises well above the courthouse roof.

In 1974, the courthouse and jail were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, one of six National Register-listed locations in the city of Norwalk and one of seventeen countywide.

In the event that the leader dies, resigns or loses their seat in Parliament, the deputy leader (if there is one) serves as interim leader until a leadership election takes place. This has occurred three times, with Menzies Campbell serving as interim leader following the resignation of Charles Kennedy (Campbell was elected leader in the ensuing election) and Vince Cable serving as interim leader following Campbell's resignation. Jo Swinson lost her seat in the general election held on 12 December 2019, thus ceasing to be leader; deputy leader Ed Davey and Party President Sal Brinton became acting co-leaders. Brinton was replaced by Mark Pack following his assuming the office of Party President on 1 January 2020. Davey won the Leadership election and became Leader on 27 August 2020 at the 2020 Liberal Democrats leadership election.

139,37850313,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent%27s%20Opera%20House,Bent's Opera House,"Bent's Opera House, also known as Bent's Hall, is a three-story building located at 444 Main Street in Medina, New York, in the United States. The building is made of Medina Sandstone and features an opera house on the top floor. Construction began in 1864 and was completed early the next year. The building is named for Don Carlos Bent, a local farmer who owned the property and had the structure erected. A formal dedication ceremony was held on February 28, 1865, featuring remarks by a Civil War officer and patriotic pageantry.

For many decades, Bent's Opera House was a prominent venue in Medina for concerts, plays, shows, commencements, elections, and other public functions. P. T. Barnum and William ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody were among the hundreds of touring performers who brought their talents to the Bent's stage.

As motion pictures and other forms of entertainment became popular in the twentieth century, the Opera House fell into disuse. Yet its legacy was not completely forgotten, as Bent's Hall was included as a contributing property to Medina's Main Street Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

In 2010, Bank of America, the building's last commercial owner, donated the Bent's Hall property to the Orleans Renaissance Group, Inc. (ORG), a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to bringing arts and cultural programs to the greater Medina community. Leaders of ORG hope to restore the Opera House to its former glory as a functioning performance venue.

ORG has since sold Bent's Opera House to Talis Equity. CEO Roger Hungerford is currently renovating and updating the building to include a restaurant, boutique hotel, and a wedding/event venue space.

In 2012, Bent's Opera House was included on the Preservation League of New York State's annual ""Seven to Save"" list. This list highlights ""valued historic resources [that] are in danger of disappearing.""

141,16267292,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay%20Saunders,Jay Saunders,"Jay Saunders (né John Henry Saunders III; born 29 June 1944 Sacramento, California) is an American trumpeter and music educator at the collegiate level.  In the 1970s, Saunders was a lead trumpeter with big bands — notably the Stan Kenton Orchestra (early seventies) — and a session musician in the Dallas area.  Saunders recently retired from the faculty at the University of North Texas College of Music where he taught jazz trumpet, jazz recordings, and directed the One O'Clock Lab Band.

Education 
Originally from Sacramento, California, Saunders attended the University of North Texas College of Music from 1965 to 1968 where he studied trumpet with John Haynie (1924–2014).  Saunders was a member of the One O'Clock Lab Band, served as an undergraduate teaching assistant in trumpet, and played two short tours with the Stan Kenton Orchestra.  After earning a Bachelor of Music in 1968, Saunders played lead trumpet in the Studio Band(now called the ""Jazz Ambassadors"") of the United States Army Field Band in Washington, D.C., from 1968 to 1971.  Upon discharge from the U.S. Army, he immediately rejoined the Kenton Orchestra in July 1971, eventually playing lead trumpet until the fall of 1972.  That fall, Saunders returned to the UNT College of Music to work on his master's degree.  While there, he served as a graduate assistant teacher of trumpet and lab bands until the summer of 1975.  He earned a Master of Music Education in fall 1974.

His tenure with the Army Studio Band (1968–71) and Kenton (1971–72) coincided closely with that of Ray Brown — a composer, arranger, trumpet player, and jazz educator, who, while with the Kenton Orchestra, held the jazz trumpet chair.

Applied music 
Saunders played lead trumpet and toured with the Stan Kenton Orchestra and the Studio Band of the United States Army Field Band at Fort Meade, Maryland.  Saunders played off and on with the Kenton band for many years and taught at Kenton clinics.  He recorded eleven albums with Kenton and one album each with Ornette Coleman and Doc Severinsen as well as many religious, Latino and rock artists.

As a member of the Jerry Gray Orchestra at the Fairmont Hotel's Venetian Room, Saunders backed noted artists, including Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine, Tony Bennett, and Ella Fitzgerald as well as hundreds of other well-established performers.  He has been an educator/performer in the Dallas–Fort Worth area since the 1980s, performing with the Fort Worth and Dallas Symphony Orchestras as part of their Pops Series, playing first trumpet for the Dallas Summer Musicals, as well as a variety of recordings and shows in the area.

Saunders has been heard playing lead trumpet on broadcasts for the BBC, VOA, WABC, KABC, WNBC, WCBS and for the CNN/SI, CNN, HBO, ESPN Radio, Warner Bros. and Paramount TV themes, in addition to many other broadcasters in the United States.  As an educator, Saunders has taught at Richland College, Tarrant County College, Texas Wesleyan University, Collin College, and the University of North Texas College of Music.

He also plays with Pete Petersen and The Collection Jazz Orchestra. ""He has a reputation as being one of the best,"" said Petersen of Saunders. Petersen told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he had needed a trumpet player for the recording of Playing in the Park in the mid-1980s. Saunders continues to play with them. The band went on to record two other albums.

The brig, Building #3107, is located in the south annex of Joint Base Charleston in the city of Hanahan, South Carolina.

The Brig was commissioned on November 30, 1989 and accepted its first prisoners in January 1990. It has 400 cells and can hold 288 inmates. It houses prisoners from all branches of the US Armed Services and conducts the Navy's Violent Offender Treatment Program. It has been accredited by the American Correctional Association ten times: 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016 & 2019; receiving 100% compliance on each correctional standard.

The brig recently housed several enemy combatants, including Yasser Hamdi, José Padilla and Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri.
Al-Marri was the last of the three to remain at the brig, being transferred to a civilian prison after he pleaded guilty in 2009.

In October 2008 91 pages of memos drafted in 2002 by an officer at the brig
became public.
The memos indicate that officers were concerned that the isolation and lack of stimuli were driving Hamdi, Padilla and Al-Marri insane.

On October 12, 2011, the Charleston Post and Courier reported on memos from E.P. Giambastiani to Charles Stimson Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, requesting that Hamdy, Padilla and al Marri be transferred to Guantanamo.
The memos were from 2005.
Giambastiani's request was declined.
The memos were released to the Post and Courier in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, filed eight years previously, for information about changes to the role of the prison triggered by al Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001.  They wrote that when the DoD's response was finally received, ""A Pentagon official apologized but gave no explanation for the long delay.""

148,1847015,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric%20visibility,Interferometric visibility,"The interferometric visibility (also known as interference visibility and fringe visibility, or just visibility when in context) quantifies the contrast of interference in any system which has wave-like properties, such as optics, quantum mechanics, water waves, sound waves, or electrical signals.  Generally, two or more waves are superimposed and as the phase difference between them varies, the power or intensity (probability or population in quantum mechanics) of the resulting wave oscillates, forming an interference pattern. The pointwise definition may be expanded to a visibility function varying over time or space. For example, the phase difference varies as a function of space in a two-slit experiment. Alternately, the phase difference may be manually controlled by the operator, for example by adjusting a vernier knob in an interferometer. The ratio of the amplitude of the interference pattern to the sum of the powers of the individual waves is the definition of visibility.
The interferometric visibility gives a practical way to measure the coherence of two waves (or one wave with itself). A theoretical definition of the coherence is given by the degree of coherence, using the notion of correlation.

Visibility in optics
In linear optical interferometers (like the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, Michelson interferometer, and Sagnac interferometer), interference manifests itself as intensity oscillations over time or space, also called fringes. Under these circumstances, the interferometric visibility is also known as the ""Michelson visibility""  or the ""fringe visibility."" For this type of interference, the sum of the intensities (powers) of the two interfering waves equals the average intensity over a given time or space domain. The visibility is written as:

in terms of the amplitude envelope of the oscillating intensity and the average intensity:

So it can be rewritten as:

where Imax is the maximum intensity of the oscillations and Imin the minimum intensity of the oscillations.  

If the two optical fields are ideally monochromatic (consist of only single wavelength) point sources of the same polarization, then the predicted visibility will be

where  and  indicate the intensity of the respective wave.  indicates the phase relationship of the original electric field.  Any dissimilarity between the optical fields will decrease the visibility from the ideal. In this sense, the visibility is a measure of the coherence between two optical fields. A theoretical definition for this is given by the degree of coherence.  This definition of interference directly applies to the interference of water waves and electric signals.

Examples

Visibility in quantum mechanics
Since the Schrödinger equation is a wave equation and all objects can be considered waves in quantum mechanics, interference is ubiquitous. Some examples: Bose–Einstein condensates can exhibit interference fringes.  Atomic populations show interference in a Ramsey interferometer.  Photons, atoms, electrons, neutrons, and molecules have exhibited interference in double-slit interferometers.

They are sometimes called armadillo eggs, especially if wrapped in bacon or sausage meat to give the appearance of an armadillo shell. The term has been used since around 1972 in Texas, antedating the trademark on ""Jalapeño Poppers"". As chile relleno can be made with jalapeño, the jalapeño popper is probably a Tex-Mex version of that dish. The name Armadillo Eggs likely comes from the perceived similarity to Scotch eggs.

When smoked or grilled and stuffed with sausage, they are also referred to as A.B.T or Atomic Buffalo Turds.

Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut holds the Major League Eating record for jalapeño poppers, eating 118 in 10 minutes at the University of Arizona on 8 April 2006.

Trademark
On April 30, 1992, Anchor Food Products applied for and later received a trademark on ""Jalapeño Poppers""; on ""Jalapeño Poppers"" used for ""processed vegetables"" however, the word ""Poppers"" had been trademarked in 1983 by the Poppers Supply Company of Portland, Oregon, for use with popcorn.  On September 27, 1993, the Poppers Supply Company successfully applied for a trademark on ""Poppers"" when used for ""coated and breaded vegetable pieces"", which they held until the trademark was transferred to Anchor Food Products on September 12, 2001.

On September 25, 2001, Heinz announced that it had completed the acquisition of the Poppers brand; however, a third party, McCain Foods, acquired Anchor's production facilities.

Leon's Texas Cuisine launched a line of cheese-stuffed, breaded, fried jalapeño product in 1985 called Jalitos; the company claims it is the original such product that was nationally distributed.

The academy teams play the Y-League and the National Premier Leagues, the highest level of youth football in Australia. Senior players occasionally play in the academy side, as in the case when they're recovering from injury. Ray Junna is the current academy manager. They train at the Central Coast Mariners Centre of Excellence and play the majority of their home games there. On occasion, they also play at Pluim Park.

Academy team history

First Academy (2012–2014)
Central Coast Mariners Academy was formed as a joint venture between the Mariners and Central Coast Football to provide a junior development pathway to the NYL and A-League sides. Prior to 2012 the academy existed solely as a junior side; however in 2012 it was accepted to participate in the New South Wales Premier League. In October 2012 the club announced that Joey Peters had been appointed as senior coach. The club finished tenth from twelve clubs in its first two seasons.

CCMA prided themselves on producing talented young players and providing a pathway for Central Coast Mariners in the Hyundai A-League.  Based on appearances for CCMA 15 year old Daniel McFarlane earned trials in the UK with Swansea City and Birmingham City.  Patrick Zwaanswijk signed up McFarlane up for the CCMA in the National Youth League. Local players Steve Whyte, Josh Forbes, Bradley Wilson and Nathan Verity also made sufficient impressions in the NSWPL season to earn them a contract in the NYL squad.

Following disputes between the Mariners and Central Coast Football over technical and financial aspects of the program, the Football NSW licence to run the representative side on the Central Coast was handed back to Central Coast Football in August 2014 and the Academy program was closed.

2015–present
A competitions review conducted by Football NSW in 2015 recommended that academy sides from Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers be included in the National Premier Leagues NSW competitions, with the inclusion of a Central Coast side to be determined between the Mariners and Central Coast Football. The Mariners subsequently applied for entry to the NPL and SAP in August 2015 and were accepted from the 2016 season onwards, replacing Central Coast FC.

History 
In the mid-16th century, Africans arrived in Japan alongside Europeans as crew members and slaves.

Yasuke, an African man, possibly from Mozambique, arrived in Japan in the late-16th century alongside Jesuit missionary Alessandro Valignano. He found favor with Oda Nobunaga, the daimyō and warlord, and ultimately became his retainer.

After WW2, with the Japanese economic miracle, many students from Africa began coming to Japan often to pursue relevant postgraduate education through MEXT and JICA. African Americans also joined the JET Programme to work as English teachers. Some African Americans arrive to serve in the United States Forces Japan.

In 2015, Ariana Miyamoto, who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an African-American father, became the first  (mixed) (derogatory) contestant to win the title of Miss Universe Japan. The decision to allow Miyamoto to win the title, due to her not being fully Japanese ethnically, was controversial.

159,56361764,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick%20Geiger,Nick Geiger,"Nick Geiger (born 1952) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s. A Queensland state and Australia national representative , he played in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for the Norths club and in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the Penrith Panthers.

Whilst playing in the Brisbane Rugby League Premiership as the Norths side's , Geiger had just served a three-match ban for a late tackle when he was selected to represent Queensland in the first match of 1977's interstate series against New South Wales due to the absence of Test hooker John Lang with a knee injury. He went on to play in the second and final match of that year's series as well. Later that year Geiger also gained selection in Australia's 1977 World Cup team. The selectors had originally chosen the Blues' George Peponis and omitted Queensland captain Arthur Beetson, but when Australian Rugby Football League president Kevin Humphreys refused to ratify the side, Beetson was reinstated, with the Queensland selectors putting in Geiger at the expense of Peponis. Geiger played the first of his four matches in total for Australia, making him Kangaroo No. 496. His last match for the Kangaroos was the closely contested 1977 Rugby League World Cup Final against Great Britain, in which he played hooker and helped Australia to a one-point victory.

Geiger made some appearances for the Penrith Panthers in the 1979 NSWRFL season's Premiership, but after being replaced by local junior Steve Martin, he returned to Brisbane.

To celebrate its 75th anniversary, the Norths Devils club in 2008 included Geiger on its list of the greatest 75 players, coaches, administrators, volunteers and supporters.

161,1931799,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full%20Circle%20with%20Michael%20Palin,Full Circle with Michael Palin,"Full Circle with Michael Palin is a 10-part 1997 documentary television series, first broadcast on BBC One in 1997. Presented by Michael Palin, Full Circle was the third of a series of programmes in which Palin made and documented lengthy journeys. The first was Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin, a 7-part series first broadcast in 1989, and the second was Pole to Pole with Michael Palin, an 8-part series first broadcast in 1992.

The series documented a 245-day, 50,000-mile (80,000 km) trip taken by Palin and a film crew around the rim of the Pacific Ocean in 1995 and 1996, beginning on the Diomede Islands between Alaska and Russia in the Bering Strait. The intent was to make the full anti-clockwise trip around the Pacific Rim and end up back on the Diomede Islands, but due to rough weather, he was unable to actually set foot back on the Islands again at the end of his journey. He got within two miles of completing the full circle. Palin travelled through Russia, Japan, South Korea (they were not allowed to pass through North Korea), China, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, United States, and Canada.

Palin also authored a companion book based upon the series, which was published concurrently with its first broadcast. This book contained both Palin's text and many pictures by Basil Pao, the stills photographer on the team. Pao also produced a separate book of the photographs he took during the journey, Full Circle - The Photographs, a large coffee-table style book printed on glossy paper.

Episodes
The programme consists of 10 episodes, each 50 minutes long. Unlike the first two Michael Palin journeys, the episodes were not given names, and are just presented as ""Episode One"", etc.

Episode One: Alaska and Russia
Palin begins his trek around the Pacific Rim at Little Diomede Island, Alaska, in hopes of returning there in a year's time. Arriving at Nome, he visits with a goldpanner on the ""Golden Sands of Nome"". Next, he journeys to Kodiak Island, but gets stuck for a couple extra days due to fog and misses the flight he had planned with the US Coast Guard to the western island of Attu. However, he does catch a glimpse of the Kodiak brown bear. Palin and his crew find an alternative: they catch the last Alaska Airlines flight of the year from Anchorage to Petropavlovsk in Russia. Arriving on the Kamchatka Peninsula, he meets his guide Igor Nosov and his assistants. They board a helicopter and observe the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, which contains some active volcanoes, as well as some reindeer. Moving on to the city of Magadan, he visits an old Gulag camp with a survivor. In Vladivostok, he observes the once-powerful Pacific Fleet and is given an opportunity to sing Polyushko-polye with the Pacific Fleet Ensemble.

Episode Two: Japan and Korea
Palin begins his time in Japan at Sado Island, where he meets the Kodō drummers. He participates in a morning run with drummer hopefuls and then takes his shot at the largest drum. Then it is on to Tokyo, where he meets up with Mayumi Nobetsu, a Japanese Monty Python fan. They tour the Asakusa neighbourhood where they decide to bet on a horse race. Palin and Nobetsu strike gold with a horse named Super License. The two also eat at a restaurant where the speciality is loaches who have been fed sake. Afterwards, they catch a punk rock concert in Yoyogi Park. Catching the shinkansen to Fukuyama, he takes in a Zen Buddhist meditation session at Buttsuji Temple. During the meditation session in the Zendo, he is struck by a keisaku, which is used to keep meditators from lulling off to sleep. In Nagasaki, he visits Huis ten Bosch, a Dutch-themed park set to symbolise old trading ties with the Dutch.

After catching a ferry to Busan in South Korea, he meets up with Shin-Na, a journalist in the capital of Seoul. Shin-Na explains to him that there still exists animosity between Koreans and the Japanese, none more evident than in the fact that most Japanese cultural items are still banned in Korea. The two then witness a rally protesting generals' immunity from prosecution in a bloody massacre in Gwangju in the early 1980s. (About 3 months after Palin left Seoul, the generals were prosecuted and imprisoned.) At the South Seoul Marriage Hall, Palin and Shin-Na attend a wedding ceremony. Palin notices that the number of traditional Korean marriages are dwindling. Not too long after, Palin encounters his first roadblock of the journey: North Korea. He can only go with a group of foreign tourists (no Koreans are allowed) led by one of the Americans stationed at the DMZ. He then ""crosses"" the border in the Joint Security Area at Panmunjeom into the North; however, he cannot venture much further than that without risking being shot or arrested. He looks out into North Korea and states that North and South Korea are not really two separate nations, that it is one nation divided against itself. Twenty-three years later, he would have the chance to tour North Korea in Michael Palin in North Korea.

Episode Three: China
Arriving in China at the port city of Qingdao, Palin checks into the Welcome Guest House, where Mao Zedong once spent a month right before the Great Leap Forward. Palin gets a massage on the streets of Qingdao and then visits a winery in the Laoshan Mountains, where he samples Chinese chardonnay. He then climbs Taishan Mountain, one of the Five Sacred Mountains of Taoism. Catching a train to Shanghai, he notices how much more modern Chinese trains have become since Around the World in 80 Days in 1988. Arriving in Shanghai, he discovers a Harvey Nichols store. Palin also takes time out to dance with one of the locals. He also finds out that the Bund, the longtime economic heart of the city (even when he last visited), has been usurped by the Pudong area. Taking an inland route via the Yangtze River, he views the construction for the Three Gorges Dam and notes how a lot of area will be submerged after its completion in 2009. In the large town of Chongqing, he chats with a university graduate over lunch about modern Chinese society. From there, Palin heads south into Guiyang and then the land of the Miao people, a Chinese minority. Some people in a Miao village note that Palin is the first Westerner they had ever seen, as well as the fact he has a big nose. From there, he catches a bus to Pingxiang and Friendship Gate, on the Vietnamese border.

Episode Four: Vietnam and the Philippines
Palin arrives in Vietnam at a time when it is reintroducing itself to the global stage, via a process called Đổi mới (""new thinking""). He also observes a local cricket match in the capital of Hanoi, although the BBC is not allowed to film because, due to the fact it took place on land owned by the Vietnamese military, it was deemed a security risk. In a series of still photographs shown in the absence of film, it is revealed that the camera is an Eclair XTR. Palin also observes the Hanoi Hilton, a prison for Americans during the Vietnam War. Catching a train going south to Saigon, he makes a stop in Huế and the Forbidden Purple City, an old imperial palace. In Da Nang, Palin relaxes at China Beach and meets up with a 16-year-old who shows him what is known as the Gateway to Heaven. In Saigon, he tours the Củ Chi tunnels which the Vietnamese military used during all the conflicts within their borders. In nearby Tay Ninh, he visits a Caodaist cathedral. Then he takes a ferry down to the end of the Mekong River.

In the Philippines, Palin notices how congested traffic is in the capital of Manila. He then chats with some women who are going abroad to work in order to support their families. Palin then takes the opportunity to observe the Banaue Rice Terraces. However, when he gets there, a dense fog prevents him from seeing the terraces, causing frustrated and disbelieving laughter. In Baguio, he witnesses two unique procedures (assisting in one of them) known as ""psychic surgery"". In the southern part of the country, Palin gets some scuba diving lessons and has a meal underwater. In Zamboanga, he attends a cockfight and also judges the Miss La Bella Pacifica beauty pageant. Afterwards, he drives a jeepney down the streets of the city, waiting for a ferry to take him to Borneo.

Episode Five: Borneo and Java
Palin catches a ferry across the Sulu Sea to the northern tip of Borneo. There, he visits an orangutan rehabilitation centre. From there, he ventures south to Kuching in Sarawak, once ruled by what were known as the White Rajahs. Then he travels inward to a longhouse where members of the Iban people reside. He chats with former headhunters and takes part in a special feast honouring the highest-ranking Iban in the Malaysian government.

Afterwards, he ventures south to the island of Java in Indonesia. From the capital Jakarta, he journeys east with his guide to a tea plantation where he samples tea and helps harvest tea leaves. They then observe a wayang kulit puppet show. In the cultural hub of Yogyakarta, they sample some durian, a pungent fruit. They then tour the Buddhist temple at Borobudur and climb Mount Bromo. In Surabaya on the east coast of Java, they encounter their first major transportation issues since Alaska. Being unable to find a boat to take him across the sea to Darwin, Australia, they settle for one that will take them east on Java, but no further.

In the DVD interview, Palin states that while in Kuching, he learned that his wife, Helen, needed surgery to remove a brain tumor. He flew back to London from Indonesia, spent a few days with her, and then flew to Australia to continue his Pacific trek

Episode Six: Australia and New Zealand
Palin begins in Darwin, where he catches a truck down to Katherine. There, he visits a crocodile farm and helps hatch a few eggs. (Palin wanted the camera to focus on the fact he held a baby crocodile in his hands for five seconds.) Nearby, he checks out an animal rehabilitation centre. Down to King's Creek, he participates in an exciting camel hunt which results in Palin actually getting one. Down to Alice Springs, he catches the Ghan train down to Adelaide, where he participates in the Desperate and Dateless Ball. Then he takes part in a cow race, where he finishes second. In Sydney, he make a cameo appearance in the soap opera Home and Away.

On to Auckland, New Zealand, he catches a train down to the town of Kaikoura. There he participates in a Māori acceptance ceremony where he spoke and sang a song he learned at Shrewsbury. Palin then travels to Aoraki / Mount Cook and Queenstown for lessons in mountaineering and rafting. He then watches bungee jumping and chats with A.J. Hackett, who developed the sport. Palin then ventures south to the University of Otago in Dunedin, where he is caught in the middle of orientation-week activities. Palin has now reached the halfway point—at least on land—around the Pacific.

Episode Seven: Chile and Bolivia
Starting the second half of his journey at Cape Horn, Palin views the end of the continent of South America. He travels through the southern islands of Chile to the town of Punta Arenas. He renews acquaintances with his guide from Pole to Pole and the statue of Ferdinand Magellan with the Indian whose toe he kissed to ensure a safe journey. Venturing through the islands, he views the Torres del Paine National Park and the grave of an English explorer who committed suicide in the area. At Chiloe Island, he chats with an American transplant who discusses the possible existence of witches on the island. Then he attends a local barbecue that included dancing and Palin attempting to play the horse's jawbone. North to Santiago, he observes a memorial to victims of the 1973 coup d'état. Driving through the Atacama Desert, Palin reaches the highest elevation of his life thus far. At the world's largest copper mine in Chuquicamata, Palin does the honours of counting down to the detonation of a mining blast. In the northern town of Arica, he catches a one-car train to La Paz in Bolivia. Things go smoothly until, as they are within striking distance of La Paz, the train has a freakish derailment. After several attempts to get the train back on line, they are successful and eventually reach the Bolivian capital in the black of night.

Episode Eight: Bolivia and Peru
At the town of Copacabana, Palin visits with reed boat makers on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Crossing the border into Peru, he chats with a lady who hopes to get the Yavari, a century-old ship, sailing again. On to Cuzco, he arrives in the middle of the Feast of Corpus Christi. He then journeys to the Inca Empire's lost city of Machu Picchu, and visits a nearby village of Inca descendants. He then catches a train to Quillabamba, and then moves on to Kiteni, where he meets a local pub owner who agrees to go up the Urubamba River with him. After a day or two consisting of sailing and birdwatching, they reach the canyon of Pongo de Mainique. Soon thereafter, they stop and set up camp for the night. Palin later states that Pongo de Mainique was his favourite place to travel in the world.

Episode Nine: Peru and Colombia
Palin and his guide approach a Machiguenga village where the feast of St. John the Baptist is going on. Palin observes men's and women's intervillage football matches. Then he samples a drink made from the yucca plant. Back on the Urubamba, Palin eventually makes it to the northern town of Iquitos. Here, there is a barrio that contains many shops. Palin visits one where a lady is making cigarettes. He then takes his first puff of a cigarette in a long while. After a little wait, Palin realises a dream by catching a boat on to the Amazon River.

Bogotá, Colombia, is described by Palin as ""trading one jungle for another."" With a guide, he discovers why the Colombian capital is one of the most dangerous places on earth. He learns that most of the trouble stems from the drug trafficking in the country. He then travels down Bullet Street, arguably the most violent street in the city. Here, rocks are thrown at the car Palin and his guide are travelling in. He then offers to take him to lunch; however, his guide declines, stating that the restaurant he is going to is owned by the father of a drug trafficker. Palin, however, continues, and is granted an interview  with horse breeder and close friend of Pablo Escobar, Don Fabio Ochoa, who at one point was the father of 3 men on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. Continuing north, he visits an emerald mine and some of the workers there. Then, it is on to Cartagena, where he hops on a party bus, celebrating the end of his nine weeks on the South American continent.

Episode Ten: Mexico, Western USA, Canada and Alaska
In Mexico City, Palin attends a lucha libre match and listens to a lively mariachi band. The next day, he observes the darker side of the city, as a graffiti protest is being led by a lucha libre wrestler named Super Barrio. On to a small village outside of Querétaro, he helps a lady make tortillas. He then catches a bus to the town of Tijuana, where after observing a house in the shape of a woman, he walks to the United States–Mexico border, known as the ""Tortilla Curtain"". Here he observes illegal immigrants ""Pollos"" attempting to enter the United States and evade the Border Patrol. Afterward, Palin crosses the border legally into San Diego and gets a glimpse of the border from the American perspective.

Venturing north to Los Angeles, he gets a bird's-eye view of the city from a local news helicopter reporter. He then becomes involved in a breaking story of a plane approaching Van Nuys Airport landing on the freeway. Driving along the California coast, he reaches San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge. He then takes a tour of Alcatraz prison and chats with two former inmates. Then he visits The Castro, known for its homosexual population. Palin's guide introduces him to a local gay policeman and then shows him the place where The NAMES Project originated in 1987. From San Francisco, he flies to Seattle, where he tests a flight simulator at Boeing headquarters.

In Canada, Palin manages to flag down a train near Vancouver, British Columbia. In the nearby town of Squamish, he is the guest of honour at a loggers sports festival, where he takes part in one of the races. Taking a train north through to Prince George, he realises that the closer he gets to completing the circle, his transportation options dwindle. On the day 245 of the journey, he reaches Wales Beach, the westernmost point on the North American mainland. However, Little Diomede is still 25 miles away. Then the Coast Guard comes to pick him up and put him on a boat that will attempt to get him there. The weather does not co-operate, and the Coast Guard abandons the attempt. Even though Palin came up two miles short, he believes, in a way, he did close the circle.

In the DVD interview, Palin said that it was somewhat fitting the circle was not closed, referencing his inability to enter the Reform Club at the end of Around the World in 80 Days and not getting on the Agulhas ship to get to Antarctica in Pole to Pole.

Broadcast history
The first episode of Full Circle was scheduled for 31 August 1997 at 8:00pm on BBC1. However, due to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in the early hours of the morning, it was moved to BBC2 at the same time, to allow rolling news coverage to continue on BBC1. The week after, instead of showing the second episode as originally scheduled, BBC1 repeated the first episode for viewers who may have missed it, with all subsequent episodes delayed a week from their intended broadcast date.

Reception
DVD Talk gave a highly positive review. The A.V. Club recommended that viewers read the companion book to get the full picture.

It is primarily used for American football and is the home field of the University of West Georgia Wolves. The stadium holds 10,000 people.

Construction
In 2003, the University of West Georgia acquired 250 acres from the city of Carrollton for the purpose of creating a stadium and athletic complex. Such a facility would serve a dual role: give UWG sports teams a facility that they could use and aid the university in its quest to continue to attract additional students. The funding for this venture was made possible through private donations and increased student fees approved by the Student Government Association.

During the summer of 2008, construction began on this facility and, in the fall of 2009, University Stadium opened. The stadium seats roughly 9,000, providing ample space for any sporting or other entertainment event. Additionally, the new athletic complex includes a stadium and practice field for the Wolves’ soccer program, a new softball stadium, and a women’s field house with locker-room facilities for both women’s sports.

166,12484409,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh%20antwren,Marsh antwren,"The marsh antwren (Formicivora acutirostris), also known as the Paraná antwren, is an insectivorous bird in the antbird family Thamnophilidae. It is endemic to marshes and swamps in the Brazilian states of Paraná and Santa Catarina.

It was first described in 1995. Although initially placed in its own genus Stymphalornis, a subsequently molecular phylogenetic study has shown that the marsh antwren is closely related to species in the genus Formicivora.

It is threatened by habitat loss and currently considered Endangered by BirdLife International.

Two subspecies are recognised:
 F. a. acutirostris Bornschein, Reinert & Teixera, 1995 – Paraná to northeast Rio Grande do Sul
 F. a. paludicola (Buzzetti et al., 2013) – east São Paulo

The subspecies F. a. paludicola was discovered near São Paulo and described in 2013 as a new species in the genus Formicivora. This subspecies has been found in fifteen small, isolated areas in the east of the state of São Paulo, not far from the city of São Paulo, in south-eastern Brazil. The sites lie within the headwaters of the Paraíba do Sul and Tietê Rivers, at elevations of . There it inhabits marshes with relatively tall () vegetation. Much of its habitat is degraded and threatened by agricultural, industrial and residential development.

Males of the subspecies F. a. paludicola can be distinguished from those of the nominate subspecies by their black underparts and thighs, very dark grey-brown upperparts, and a smaller exposed culmen. Females are distinguished by their very dark grey-brown upperparts and flanks, and smaller exposed culmen.

The fourth edition of the Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World and the online edition of the Handbook of the Birds of the World both treat the two subspecies as separate species and place them in the genus Formicivora. In their treatment Formicivora acutirostris is given the English name ""Parana antwren"" and Formicivora paludicola the name ""marsh antwren"".

The suspended cup-shaped nest is made of dry vegetation. It is usually attached to reeds or grasses at a height of between  above the ground. The clutch is two white eggs which have irregular brown blotches. The average size is  with a weight of around .

167,34258162,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth%20Christian%20School,Rehoboth Christian School,"Rehoboth Christian School is a private, parent-controlled Christian school in Rehoboth, New Mexico. Founded in 1903 as Rehoboth Mission School, the school serves a portion of the Navajo Nation and its student body is predominantly Native American.

History
The school was started as Rehoboth Mission School in 1903 by  Christian Reformed Church (CRC)  missionaries to the Navajo and Zuni people. The missionaries of Dutch descent named the settlement ""Rehoboth"", meaning ""plenty of room"", and the school's entrance sign (pictured) quotes , ""Now the Lord has given us room, we shall flourish in the land"". It was established on the  former Smith's Ranch, near Gallup, New Mexico, purchased  by the CRC Board of Missions. It opened with six Navajo children aged 5 – 11. In its early years as an Indian boarding school, the children were forbidden to speak the Navajo language and were taught to eschew their native culture. In the 1940s, a high school was added. By 1985, enrollment had grown to 375 pupils, of whom 63% were Native Americans, mostly Navajo. In 2002, the school's then-executive director, Ron Polinder, was quoted as saying, ""We came here 100 years ago with some cultural arrogance, expecting Native American people to become like white people"". Courses in the Navajo language were added to the high school's curriculum in 2002 and since expanded to encompass all grades. The school is now ""committed to respecting Native culture and language"", its website states.

As of , there are 511 students in grades Pre K-12. In the 1970s, control transitioned to a local school board largely made up of Native American parents, and in 1973 the school’s name was changed to Rehoboth Christian School. Formerly having boarding students, in the 1990s the dormitories were closed and bus transportation was provided for children within a 60-mile radius.
 
Rehoboth Christian School is listed as one of the 50 Best Christian High Schools in America for 2020 by TheBestSchools.org. Approximately sixty-five percent of the school's students go on the college.

Campus
The entire campus is approximately  in size, with new high school facilities built in 2018. In addition to academic studies, students attend classes in the Bible. Courses in Technology are accommodated by three networked computer labs and a mobile laptop lab with wireless internet access. The school has seven smart-board classrooms, along with mounted projectors in its eight elementary classrooms as well as all high school classrooms. The school's library has 14,000 titles with digital catalogue search and magazine subscriptions. There is a Navajo Code Talkers Communication Center.

The Sports and Fitness Center includes a weight room, two full-size basketball courts, turf soccer field and rubberized track. The gymnasium is equipped with a ropes course, and indoor and outdoor climbing walls.

The school includes half of the Calvin-Rehoboth Robotic Observatory, equipped with a Meade Instruments 10’ LX200 telescope with digital camera.

Rehoboth's dormitories, apartments and RV park are available for short and long term volunteers and guests.

Students

The Rehoboth Christian School student body consists of 67% Native American students, 23% Anglo students, and 10% of other ethnic minority backgrounds. More than 13 denominations are represented at Rehoboth, including Christian Reformed, Baptists, and Catholic churches. As of the 2011–2012 school year, there were 497 children enrolled in grades PreK-12.

Recent student honors include:

Chief Manuelito Scholars: (2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014,)
Daniel’s Scholarship (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014)
Gallup Rotary (2010, 2011, 2013, 2014)
Gates Millennium Scholars (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014).

A highlight for middle school students took place in 1999, when 7th and 8th graders participated in an inter-cultural video teleconference with students in Dayton, Ohio. The students presented Navajo crafts and dress to students in the Buckeye State, as well as bragging about the beauty of their New Mexico scenery.

Faculty
The school has 37 full-time teaching staff members and five part-time staff members. Although Rehoboth is no longer a boarding school, as of early 2000s some faculty were still living on campus. The school's Art teacher since 1978, Elmer Yazzie, is noted for painting Biblical scenes using his own brushes handmade from the yucca plant. A Navajo, Yazzie has presented his artistry at workshops in Hanford, California. Another art teacher at the school, Steven E. Heil, is a published author. He wrote a 2001 article, ""Traditional Earthen Architecture in the Art Curriculum"", for the National Art Education Association's Art Education magazine. In it, he discussed the value of teaching the creative process of architectural design in a school's art curriculum, especially as it relates to local culture. In studying adobe structures in his classes, Heil said, Zuni students learned ""something that was theirs ... is valuable and worth preserving"".

Accreditation
Rehoboth Christian School is accredited by CSI (Christian Schools International).

Extracurricular activities
21st Century After-School Program: Over 200 students from Rehoboth and nearby Church Rock Elementary attend this federally funded after-school enrichment program, including tutoring and sport programs.

Activities include choir, school band and sports. In 2010, ten students made the All-State choir. The high school choir has toured California, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Germany. In 2002, the choir performed in Vancouver (British Columbia, Canada). The high school band toured the Pacific Northwest and California in 2011, and toured Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota in 2013. In 2014, for example, the high school choir of 50 singers presented I Will Rise in Bellingham, Washington, in conjunction with the choir of Lynden Christian School.

Organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at its highest level of competition, the Football Bowl Subdivision it began on September 3, 2020.

The season was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; all of the Power Five conferences initially announced plans to play a fall football season beginning on August 29, but greatly reducing non-conference games to limit the extent of interstate travel. The ACC, Big 12, and SEC, as well as several other Group of Five conferences, began their seasons in September (though with some conferences delaying their start, and all ""Week 0"" kickoff games were scratched due to the aforementioned restrictions on non-conference play), while independent Notre Dame agreed to play a full conference schedule with the ACC.

In August, the Big Ten, Pac-12, MAC, Mountain West, and several independents announced that they would delay their football seasons indefinitely due to concerns regarding the pandemic, targeting the possibility of playing in the spring of 2021 instead. By late September, however, the four conferences had reversed their decisions and announced plans to play shortened seasons.

Aside from all-star games, the postseason concluded on January 11, 2021, with the College Football Playoff (CFP) National Championship at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida; this was the seventh season of the College Football Playoff championship system. Some postseason activities, including the final CFP rankings and the Heisman Trophy nominations, were delayed in order to provide flexibility for conferences to finish delayed seasons in mid-December. A number of bowl games were canceled due to recommendations by local health officials, or because they were unable to secure teams after multiple programs opted out of bowl games due to COVID-19 concerns. Additionally due to COVID-19, the Rose Bowl was played outside of Pasadena, California for the first time since 1942, while the New Mexico Bowl was played in Texas.

Conference realignment

Membership changes

Rule changes
The following playing rule changes were approved by the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel for 2020:
 Players ejected for targeting will now be considered ""disqualified"" and be permitted to remain in the bench area instead of returning to the locker room.  Players ejected for other reasons (two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, fighting, contact with officials, etc.) will continue to return to the locker room.
 Restricting the number of players on a team wearing the same uniform number to two; such players still cannot be on the field at the same time and must play different positions.
 Including the number ""0"" as a legal uniform number.
 Extending the official's jurisdiction prior to kickoff from 60 to 90 minutes, requiring a coach from each team be on the field during warm-ups, and identifying each player by number.
 Defensive teams are allowed to briefly have twelve players on the field to anticipate the offensive formation, however having twelve (or more) players on the field at the snap is a live-ball five-yard penalty for illegal substitution. Previously this foul was a dead-ball foul, called if the defense had twelve (or more) players on the field for at least three seconds. 
 Adopting as a guideline a maximum of 2 minutes for instant replay reviews. Exceptions will be allowed in ""exceptionally complicated"" or end-of-game situations.
 On personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties committed by the defense during a play that results in a touchdown or after a touchdown but before the try, the offense has the option to enforce the penalty on the try, the ensuing kickoff, or on the succeeding spot (if in overtime).
 If the game clock expires at the end of a half, replay determines that time was remaining, and the game situation calls for the clock to start on the referee's signal, the half ends unless the replay determines that the clock should have stopped with 3 or more seconds left.

Other headlines
 February 18 – The NCAA announced that it was considering a proposal that would allow student-athletes in all sports a one-time waiver to transfer to a new school without having to sit out a season. This would place all NCAA sports under the same transfer rules; currently, first-time transfers are only required to sit out a season in baseball, men's and women's basketball, football, and men's ice hockey. The existing criteria for the waiver would be extended to these five sports—namely, a player must receive a transfer release from his or her previous school, leave that school academically eligible, maintain academic progress at the new school, and not be under any disciplinary suspension.
 February 20 – Pitt's football program has been placed on three years' probation as part of a series of violations announced by the Division I Committee on Infractions, which also included violations from their men's basketball team and former head coach Kevin Stallings. The football infractions result from a scheme where non-coaching ""quality control"" staffers performed coaching duties. If people from outside the football program were present at practice, music would be played to alert the staffers to their presence so they could leave. Pat Narduzzi was present at a football practice these three staff members performed coaching duties and was ordered to be held out of practice for two days in August. The school received other sanctions.
 February 26 – The new LA Bowl was announced on February 26, matching the Mountain West's No. 1 team against the Pac-12's No. 5. Beginning in December, the game will be held at SoFi Stadium, the new 70,240-seat home of the Los Angeles Chargers and Rams in Inglewood, California. The LA Bowl is locked in at SoFi from 2020 to 2025.
 December 3 – The Knight Commission, a non-NCAA group backing college athletics reform whose membership includes many university presidents and former athletic directors, recommended that FBS football be separated from the NCAA, with FBS programs becoming part of a new body that would take over all roles that the NCAA now assumes with respect to that sport. All other sports at FBS schools would remain under NCAA governance, and the NCAA would continue to govern all lower levels of football, including FCS.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

Season preparations 
Multiple universities and conferences had already canceled their spring football games as part of the wider, nationwide suspension of organized sports and athletics due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On March 13, the NCAA announced a suspension of all Division I on-campus and off-campus recruiting until April 15. In regards to its impact on the regular season, NCAA president Mark Emmert stated on May 8 that individual decisions on fall semester sports would likely begin to appear as early as June or around July 4. He suggested that the operation of athletics programs would depend on students being present on-campus to a degree (but not necessarily ""up and running in the full normal model""), explaining that ""you have to treat the health and well-being of the athletes at least as much as the regular students"", but that ""this is going to be a very unusual school year, and we just have to make the best of it"".

The NCAA Division I Council prohibited on-campus activities through May 31; on May 20, the Council voted to end the moratorium and allow voluntary on-campus activity in football and basketball to begin June 1, subject to new safety protocols. On June 17, the Division I Council approved a timetable for a season assumed to begin September 5, including beginning non-voluntary training activities on July 13.

On June 24, USA Today reported that at least 37 FBS schools had reported positive cases of COVID-19 among student-athletes or staff since practices resumed. Amidst a spike in cases in the Southern U.S. since late-June, several state governors, including Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Georgia's Brian Kemp, and South Carolina's Henry McMaster, have warned that football season could be threatened if cases do not subside in time.

On July 13, it was announced that the Patriot League would not be participating in a football season this year, however, the United States Military Academy as well as the Naval Academy were not included in the settlement as their school superintendent was in charge of making decisions regarding whether their athletic programs would have their seasons.

On July 16, the NCAA released a series of recommendations regarding protocols for fall sports, including that all participants in ""high contact risk sports"" be tested with results within 72 hours of play. President Emmert noted, however, that the guidelines presumed that the infection rate would be ""manageable"", and that ""If there is to be college sports in the fall, we need to get a much better handle on the pandemic."" The American Athletic Conference announced the same day that it will adhere to this protocol; commissioner Mike Aresco stated that ""with the proper quarantine and the proper canvassing of close contacts, we think at this point it would be safe to play games."" On July 18, the SEC announced that it would still honor scholarships for players who opt out of the fall season due to safety concerns.

On July 28, by request of the Football Oversight Committee, the NCAA announced that it had issued a blanket waiver to allow any team to play in ""Week 0"", in order to allow for greater scheduling flexibility amid changing conditions.

On August 12, members of the NCAA Division I council met and discussed eligibility for student-athletes. They recommended to the Division I board that athletes should be granted an extension on their 5-year eligibility due to the pandemic.

In the event that conditions would not improve by the traditional timeframe of football season, the possibility of delaying the football season entirely to spring 2021 was suggested by several coaches. However, it was largely considered by them to be a last resort. Aresco commented that such a delay would likely require practices to be held over the winter indoors—environments that have been shown to exacerbate spread of COVID-19.

Conference responses 
All of the Power Five conferences initially announced that they would go on with their season as scheduled, but with cuts to non-conference games in order to overcome logistical concerns and reduce interstate travel. The Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC were all limiting play to in-conference opponents only. The ACC and Big 12 would allow one non-conference game each, with the ACC restricting them to in-state opponents. The ACC also suspended the use of divisions, with the top two teams in conference play by winning percentage advancing to the ACC Championship Game.

The restrictions complicated matters for FBS independents; the first four games of the BYU Cougars were all against Big Ten and Pac-12 teams, while Notre Dame lost three of its marquee games of the season—including one against Wisconsin that was to be played at Lambeau Field, and traditional rivalry games against Stanford (not held for the first time since 1996) and USC (postponed for the first time since 1945 due to World War II). Notre Dame and Navy had also canceled a planned international game in Dublin, Ireland, and tentatively rescheduled it for Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. Some FCS conferences (such as the Patriot League) have canceled or postponed the football season outright, affecting games against FBS opponents.

On July 29, the ACC announced that Notre Dame (which is an ACC member in all other sports outside of football and men's ice hockey, the latter a sport not sponsored by the ACC) would participate as a member of the conference for the 2020 season, being incorporated into its scheduling model (including 10 games against ACC opponents, expanding from six already scheduled) and being eligible to compete for the conference championship. Notre Dame pooled its media rights revenue from NBC with that of the ACC's other media rights, and was eligible to receive a share of the total revenue.

Among the Group of Five conferences, Conference USA announced on August 7 that it had approved an eight-game schedule with up to four non-conference games. The next day, however, the Mid-American Conference (MAC) announced the postponement of all fall sports for the 2020 season, including football. The conference stated that it would pursue attempts to play in spring 2021. With this decision, the MAC became the first FBS conference to cancel or postpone the football season. Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher stated that ""there are simply too many unknowns to put our student-athletes into situations that are not clearly understood."" The cancellation of non-conference games by the Power Five conferences—especially the Big Ten—was also expected to have a financial impact on its schools, with the Big Ten games alone expected to bring $11 million.

In the wake of the decision, ESPN reported on August 9 that the commissioners of the Power Five conferences had held an emergency meeting to discuss possible options for fall sports, amid the worsening state of the pandemic in the United States. On August 10, the Mountain West Conference (MWC) followed the MAC as the second Group of Five conference to postpone fall sports indefinitely. Despite the postponement, Air Force will still contest the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy games against Navy and Army.

On August 11, the Big Ten became the first Power Five conference to postpone fall sports, followed shortly thereafter by the Pac-12. The Nebraska Cornhuskers of the Big Ten disclosed an intent to attempt non-conference play in the fall, although the logistical aspects of such a move (including scheduling) and possible repercussions within the conference were unknown. Commissioner Kevin Warren confirmed that Nebraska could not do so as a member of the Big Ten. A major factor in the Big Ten's decision was cardiovascular complications from the virus, while the Pac-12 cited that rapid testing capabilities would be needed to resume play.

Following the decisions, the ACC, Big 12, and SEC all issued statements affirming their intent to play as scheduled in the fall. The Big Ten's decision became politicized, with President Donald Trump having criticized closures of university campuses, and having pushed in particular for the Big Ten to play in the fall. After the decision to postpone the season, the Big Ten formed a taskforce to investigate options for a return to play.

On September 16, the Big Ten approved an eight-game conference season that would begin October 24, and conclude on December 19 with cross-division matchups between each seed (with the game between the top seeds played as the Big Ten Championship Game). The conference is instituting a daily antigen testing protocol beginning September 30; PCR tests will be used to confirm positives found via antigen testing. Players who test positive on both tests will be removed from play for at least 21 days and undergo cardiac tests during this period, and will have to be cleared by a cardiologist before they can return to play. Positivity rates among participating teams and the local population will also be a factor: teams with a positivity rate above 5% or a population positivity rate above 7% will be required to halt all activity for seven days.

In response to the Big Ten's reversal, Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott stated that the conference was awaiting authorization by health officials in California and Oregon to resume full-contact practices, and that it was also monitoring the air quality impact of ongoing wildfires in the western United States. The conference secured a provider for rapid testing earlier in the month. On September 24, the Pac-12 officially announced that it would allow football, basketball, and winter sports seasons to resume, with plans to play a seven-game conference season beginning on November 6, and concluding with the Pac-12 Championship Game on December 18.

The same day, the Mountain West announced that it too had approved an eight-game conference season beginning October 24. The next day, the MAC unanimously approved a six-game season beginning in November.

On November 19, the Pac-12 lifted a restriction on non-conference home games.

Impact on the postseason 
On July 15, the Rose Parade was canceled due to the pandemic. The same day, the NCAA announced that FBS teams would be permitted to count two wins against FCS teams, instead of the usual one, towards bowl eligibility. The NCAA later waived bowl eligibility requirements for the 2020–21 bowl season.

On August 5, the College Football Playoff (CFP) announced that it would delay the announcement of its final rankings and matchups for the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl from December 6 to December 20, in order to accommodate conferences that had delayed their championship games to mid-December. The CFP announced that it would still go on as scheduled, with only the teams playing in the fall being eligible for consideration in its rankings.

The voting deadline for the Heisman Trophy was similarly pushed back to December 21, with the presentation likewise scheduled for January 5, 2021. On November 14, the in-person presentation was canceled (its previous site, the PlayStation Theater in New York City, had also closed at the beginning of the year). The presentation was moved to ESPN's studio in Bristol, Connecticut, scheduled as a television-only event with finalists and past winners appearing via remote interviews.

Several bowl games were canceled due to the pandemic, while others, including the Fiesta Bowl and Rose Bowl, were restricted to being played behind closed doors without fans due to local health orders. On December 19, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association announced that the Rose Bowl would be re-located to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (typically the host of the Cotton Bowl Classic), citing rising cases in the state of California, and state health officials denying a request to allow at least the family members of players to attend. The Tournament of Roses Association stated that it was unclear whether they will still be allowed to refer to the game as the ""Rose Bowl"", as doing so will require permission from the city of Pasadena under their Master License Agreement.

Player responses 
Several players from the Pac-12 announced a unity group titled #WeAreUnited to negotiate with the conference and league with specific demands in regards to the 2020 football season. Including some players willing to boycott if their ultimatum was not satisfied. Players from the Big Ten, created a similar unity which calls for increase in testing and safety protocols.

Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence sparked a trend on Twitter with the hashtag, #WeWantToPlay, on August 9. Other players such as Justin Fields (Ohio State), Najee Harris (Alabama), and Chuba Hubbard (Oklahoma State), help contribute to make the hashtag No. 1 in the United States on Twitter. President Donald Trump shared Lawrence's tweet, stating ""The student-athletes have been working too hard for their season to be cancelled."" as well using the #WeWantToPlay hashtag. Later #WeAreUnited and #WeWantToPlay merged with players across the Power 5, with the goal of creating a union. Nick Saban joins other coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Ryan Day, by joining the movement, by stating players will be safer from the virus together as a team than at home.

Eight Nebraska players sued the Big Ten in late-August 2020, claiming that the conference's council did not actually vote on postponing the football season.

Teams opting out 
The newly independent UConn Huskies announced that they would opt out of the 2020 season.
The Old Dominion Monarchs of Conference USA announced that they would opt out of the 2020 season.
Independent New Mexico State Aggies announced that they would opt out of playing fall football and try to play in spring 2021.
Independent UMass Minutemen initially announced that they would opt of playing fall football and hoped to construct a season in spring 2021, but the university reversed the decision in late September and announced its intention to play beginning in mid-October.

Attendance restrictions 
Some teams announced that they tentatively planned to allow spectators at their games at a percentage of normal capacity, such as the Texas Longhorns (Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium was already to have slightly reduced capacity this season due to renovations) and the North Carolina Tar Heels. All events held in the state of New York, as well as all Big Ten and Pac-12 games, were played behind closed doors. The Big Ten and Pac-12 bans applied even if spectators were otherwise allowed under local health orders.

The Army Black Knights and Navy Midshipmen's home games were closed to the public, with attendance limited to their cadets and midshipmen respectively. On October 23, it was announced that the Army–Navy Game would be re-located from Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field to Michie Stadium—the Black Knights' home stadium at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point—citing Pennsylvania state restrictions on gatherings that would prevent the cadets and midshipmen from attending. As with their home games, attendance was limited to the academies' student bodies. It marked the first Army–Navy Game not played at a neutral site since 1943.

Postponed or canceled games

Stadiums

Upcoming
 The 2020 season was the first for South Alabama at Hancock Whitney Stadium replacing Ladd–Peebles Stadium. The team was scheduled to play its first game there on September 12 against Grambling State. The Senior Bowl postseason all-star game (which had been played at Ladd–Peebles) also moved to the new stadium for this season's edition in January 2021.
 The 2020 season was the last season for UAB at Legion Field before moving to Protective Stadium on the grounds of the Birmingham–Jefferson Convention Complex in 2021. The Blazers played their final game at Legion Field on October 23 against Louisiana.
 The 2020 season was the first for UNLV at Allegiant Stadium replacing Sam Boyd Stadium. The team was scheduled to play its first game there on August 29 against California.

Renamed
 Georgia State renamed their stadium to Center Parc Stadium in a naming rights agreement with the Atlanta Postal Credit Union.
UCF renamed their stadium to Bounce House. Their previous naming rights deal with Charter Spectrum expired after the 2019 season. A potential naming rights deal with RoofClaim.com was vetoed by the Florida Legislature.

Kickoff games
All kickoff games were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Week Zero""
The regular season was scheduled to begin on August 29 with various ""Week 0"" games, but all were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were two especially notable Week Zero games:

Originally, Marshall was set to play at East Carolina, to honor the 50th anniversary of the plane crash that killed 75 people, including 37 from the Marshall University football team. The crash occurred as the Thundering Herd were returning from a game at East Carolina.

Additionally, the Emerald Isle Classic at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland was scheduled to occur during Week 0, featuring Navy versus Notre Dame. However, on June 2, 2020, the game was moved from Dublin to Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. Eventually, the game was canceled altogether. The game would have been be the first in the history of the Navy–Notre Dame football rivalry to be played at Navy's home stadium. The series will resume in 2021.

Week 1
The majority of FBS teams were scheduled to open the season on Labor Day weekend. However, most conferences delayed the start of their seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the ACC and Big 12 conferences were scheduled to begin play the weekend of September 12, while the SEC conference began conference-only play the weekend of September 26.

Four neutral-site ""kickoff"" games were scheduled to be held but were also canceled.
Texas Kickoff (NRG Stadium, Houston): Baylor vs. Ole Miss

185,348996,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashiro%20Province,Yamashiro Province,"was a province of Japan, located in Kinai. It overlaps the southern part of modern Kyoto Prefecture on Honshū. Aliases include , the rare , and . It is classified as an upper province in the Engishiki.

Yamashiro Province included Kyoto itself, as in 794 AD Yamashiro became the seat of the imperial court, and, during the Muromachi period, was the seat of the Ashikaga shogunate as well. The capital remained in Yamashiro until its de facto move to Tokyo in the 1870s.

History
""Yamashiro"" was formerly written with the characters meaning ""mountain"" () and ""era"" (); in the 7th century, there were things built listing the name of the province with the characters for ""mountain"" and ""ridge""/""back"" (). On 4 December 794 (8 Shimotsuki, 13th year of Enryaku), at the time of the establishment of Heian-kyō, because Emperor Kanmu made his new capital utilize the surroundings as natural fortification, the character for shiro was finally changed to ""castle"" (). Later shiro from the province name replaced the older ki as the Japanese reading for the character 城.

Just from Nara period writings, it is apparent that the ""area"" () and ""ridge"" () listings coexisted.

The provincial capital, according to the Wamyō Ruijushō, was .

In the Shūgaishō, Otokuni District is mentioned as the seat, as well as in the Setsuyōshū.

As for the shugos mansion, at first, Yamashiro Province shugo and Kyoto shugo were concurrent posts, so the Kyoto shugo's kogenins mansion had to be allotted. Afterwards, the Rokuhara Tandai came to be an additional post, and that became the shugo as well. In the Muromachi period, Yamashiro Province was divided with the Uji River as the border into two districts, and each came to be assigned a shugo, so one shugo resided in Uji Makishima, whereas the other resided in various places around Yodo and such.

Temples
The provincial temples included those where the resident chief priest was a man, and those where it was a woman in Sōraku District. Kuni no Miya's Daigokuden was made a temple in 746. It was destroyed by fire in 882, and the rebuilding afterwards would decline. In the Kamakura period, it came to be a branch temple of Byōdō-in. The location is in modern Kizugawa city, coinciding with Kamo. In 1925, a large number of old tiles were excavated near the provincial temple, and it is thought that these once belonged to the convent.

The Kamo Shrines—the Kamigamo Shrine in the Kita ward of Kyoto and the Shimogamo Shrine in Sakyō ward—were designated as the two chief Shinto shrines (ichinomiya) of Yamashiro province.

Yamashiro's ichinomiya designation differed from other provinces', likely due to the Jingi-kan; from nearly the end of the 11th century, when the primary shrines were being established in each of the various provinces, it is thought that in Kinai, it was decided on after the turn on the 12th century. There were no ninomiya (secondary shrines). It is unknown whether there were any sōja.

This was the nation's sixteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.

Comité Olímpico Colombiano sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games since 1972. A total of 53 athletes, 32 men and 21 women, took part in 18 sports. Ten Colombian athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including tennis player Fabiola Zuluaga in the women's singles, road cyclist Víctor Hugo Peña, and weightlifter Carmenza Delgado, who became the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Colombia left Athens with a total of two Olympic bronze medals, which were both awarded to weightlifter Mabel Mosquera, and track cyclist María Luisa Calle in the women's points race. Originally, Calle finished in the bronze medal position, but was later disqualified under a strict liability rule after she had been tested positive for the banned stimulant heptaminol, handing the medal over to U.S. cyclist Erin Mirabella. As a result of the International Olympic Committee's decision on November 23, 2005, the bronze medal was officially reinstated to Calle after this had been proven to be a false positive due to isometheptene presence in an analgesic prescribed during the competition.

193,38313199,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feriye%20Palace,Feriye Palace,"The Feriye Palace () is a complex of Ottoman imperial palace buildings along the European shoreline of the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul, Turkey. Currently, the buildings host educational institutions such as a high school and a university.

The palace complex was commissioned by Sultan Abdülaziz (reigned 1861–76) in 1871, and designed by architect Sarkis Balyan. The buildings were built to meet the need of the extended family members of the imperial court for residence. The palace, which was constructed in addition to Dolmabahçe Palace and Çırağan Palace, took the name ""Feriye"" meaning ""secondary"" or ""auxiliary"" in Ottoman Turkish language. It consists of three main buildings on the waterfront, a ward for concubines, a small two-story building and outbuildings on the backside.

On May 30, 1876, Sultan Abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers. He moved to Feriye Palace at his own request after a four-day stay in Topkapı Palace. Shortly after, he was found wrists cut at Feriye Palace. This was documented as a suicide at the time.

Various members of the Ottoman imperial court resided in Feriye Palace until March 3, 1924, the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate by the parliament of the newly founded Republic of Turkey.  The buildings remained vacant for a period of time following the external deportation of the last caliph Abdülmecid II together with the court members.

Current use
In 1927, the Maritime College () settled in 
some buildings of Feriye Palace. In the 1928-29 academic term, Kabataş High School also moved into some buildings of the palace complex. Part of the palace hosted the girls' section of Galatasaray High School when in 1967 the institution started mixed-gender education. Part of the complex in northeastern remained years long neglected.

The Maritime College was transformed into Istanbul Technical University's School of Maritime in 1981, and moved to Tuzla, Istanbul. The buildings became temporarily vacant, were then assigned to Ziya Kalkavan Maritime Vocational High School in 1982.

The buildings, which girls' section of Galatasaray High School used, were turned over to Galatasaray University in 1992. The main building is used by a number of the university's faculties, such as the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Communications and various administrative offices. The main building, which is currently used by the university was originally known as İbrahim Tevfik Efendi Sahil Sarayı

In 1995, the section of the palace complex in state of neglect was restored by Kabataş Education Foundation, and turned into an upper-class restaurant, Feriye Lokantası.

The main building, which is used by Galatasaray University, was severely damaged by fire on January 22, 2013. The Ministry of Culture has stated that the building would be restored to its previous state, and would continue to be utilized furthermore for educational purposes.

In PIH, a microporous material is placed under pressure in the presence of water in the pressure-transmitting fluid of a diamond anvil cell.

Early physical characterization and initial diffraction experiments in zeolites were followed by the first unequivocal structural characterization of PIH in the small-pore zeolite natrolite (Na16Al16Si24O80 x 16H2O), which in its fully super-hydrated form, Na16Al16Si24O80 x 32H2O, doubles the amount of water it contains in its pores.

PIH has now been demonstrated in natrolites containing Li, K, Rb and Ag as monovalent cations as well as in large-pore zeolites, pyrochlores, clays and graphite oxide.

Using the noble gases Ar, Kr, and Xe as well as CO2 as pressure-transmitting fluids, researchers have prepared and structurally characterized the products of reversible, pressure-induced insertion of Ar Kr, and CO2 as well as the irreversible insertion of Xe and water.

Career
Born in Slamannan (then in Stirlingshire) but raised in a mining community near Cambuslang in South Lanarkshire, Raisback began his football career as a teenager with Larkhall Thistle, alongside elder brothers Bill (later of Clyde, Sunderland and Falkirk) and Alex (later captain of Liverpool, Partick Thistle and Scotland).

In 1900 he followed the route into the professional level taken by Alex and joined Hibernian, making 11 Scottish Football League appearances for the side which finished 3rd in the table. The following year he joined Dundee but did not make a league appearance, spending the end of the campaign with Queens Park Rangers in England. Ultimately, however, he next signed for  Liverpool where his brother Alex was already an established player. He spent two years with the Anfield club but never appeared for the first team.

In 1904, he transferred to the newly formed Hull City. They did not play in official competitions in their first year, but their many friendlies included a home meeting with Liverpool which the visitors won 6–2. Over the next two campaigns in the Football League Second Division, Raisbeck made 47 league appearances and scored 5 goals, including one in a 4–0 victory over West Bromwich Albion.

Personal life
In 1907, Raisbeck decided to leave Hull City and emigrate to a new life in Canada, accompanied by many of his family members including his footballing brother Bill. He died in 1958 in British Columbia.

In addition to the three brothers, their cousin Luke Raisbeck was also a footballer who played for several clubs including West Ham United and Blackpool.

Antonia was born in the former parish of Sao Miguel de Aveiro and baptized on 5 January 1572 in a poor home of anglers, right outside of the city walls of Aveiro. She was the daughter of Simao Rodrigues and Lianor Dias. At the age of 12, her parents obligated her to move to Lisbon to live with her older sister and brother-in-law, both of whom she did not get along with. She disliked her housework and fought with them and often ran away from their home. Eager to escape, she dressed herself as a man, cut her hair, and disguised herself and adopted the name of António Rodrigues and joined the crew as a cabin boy of the ship named Nossa Senhora do Socorro, loaded with wheat that was heading to the Portuguese territory of Mazagan, in Morocco.

After her arrival at Mazagan she enlisted in the local infantry and acquired skills in weapons handling and achieved command of troops against an invasion of Moors. She made herself noted for her campaigns against the Moors and had a successful military career and was known as ""o Terror dos Mouros"". After disguising her body and avoiding any advancements from female suitors, Beatriz de Meneses, daughter of Diogo de Mendonca, one of the main nobles who lived in Mazagan, fell in love with ""the handsome Antonio Rodrigues"", so strongly that Beatriz fell ill and her father, the Chief knight, asked the major captain to force the marriage. Antonia feared being discovered, since it was not customary to refuse good marriages, she confessed that for about 5 years she had been hiding her body in order to have a life that is forbidden to women. The confession reached the governor and Antonia was forced to return as a woman. In 1603, She went on to marry a colleague and was decorated for service by Philip II of Portugal in 1619 in the courts of Madrid. After Philip's death in 1621, she retired from service and lived an anonymous civil life in Portugal and was no longer heard of and died around the year 1641.

203,9903038,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuxton,Cuxton,"Cuxton is a village in the unitary authority of Medway in South East England. It lies on the left bank of the River Medway in the North Downs. It is served by the A228, and Cuxton railway station on the Medway Valley Line between Strood and Maidstone. A low valley leads up from the river to the hamlet of Lower Bush.

History

Archaeological evidence suggest the first human occupation was around 200,000 years ago. A hoard of 196 handaxes from the Acheulian era was excavated in 1962. This is now displayed in the British Museum. The name is believed to have developed from ""Cucula's stone"".

The remains of a Roman villa were found under the church yard. The Saxons occupied the town and it became known as Cuckelstane. The church and parish was given by Æthelwulf, King of the West Saxons to the Cathedral church of St. Andrew, Rochester. The church contains much Norman architecture, and is unusual as it lies on a southeast–northwest axis. This gave rise to the rhyme, He that would see a church miswent / Let him go to Cucklestane in Kent.

In Tudor times the principal house in the town was Whorne's Place, erected on the river by Sir William Whorne, Lord Mayor of London in 1487. This was later owned by the Leveson family and most notably Sir John Leveson who was Lord Deputy Lieutenant of Kent. This was taken over by the Mashams, strong royalists who moved on to the Mote in Maidstone. The mansion was demolished in 1782 and only an outlying granary, now a house still bearing the name Whorne's Place, survives in 2011.

The only other manor in Tudor Cuxton was that of Beresse or Beresh, now known as Bush. It doesn't survive.

In 1610, William Laud was rector of Cuxton; he later became Archbishop of Canterbury under Charles I and was executed by the puritans in 1645 because of his strong royalist loyalties.

In Upper Bush there are four houses dating from 14th century and a Tudor Kentish Yeoman's house. A tin chapel from Cuxton was dismantled and re-erected at the Museum of Kent Life, Sandling.

On 10 August 2015, a gang smuggling guns into the UK were filmed by officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) as they unloaded their illicit cargo near Cuxton Marina. The gang were intercepted as they made their way to a second site, where they planned to bury the weapons; two of the gang were subsequently found guilty of gun smuggling.

204,43904333,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian%20Dalmatia,Venetian Dalmatia,"Venetian Dalmatia () refers to parts of Dalmatia under the rule of the Republic of Venice, mainly from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Dalmatia was first sold to Venice in 1409 but Venetian Dalmatia wasn't fully consolidated from 1420. It lasted until 1797, when the Republic of Venice fell to the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte and Habsburg Austria.

Geography

The Republic of Venice had possessions in the Balkans and in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including Venetian Albania in the Adriatic Sea and the Venetian Ionian Islands in western Greece. Its possessions in Dalmatia stretched from the Istria peninsula to what is today coastal Montenegro: they included all the Dalmatian islands and the mainland territories from the central Velebit mountains to the northern borders of the Republic of Ragusa. With the 1718 Treaty of Passarowitz, Venice enlarged its possessions in Dalmatia to their greatest extent: it made some small advances, taking the areas of Signa, Imotski and Vrgorac in the Dalmatian hinterland.

History

Middle Ages

Beginning with Doge Pietro II Orseolo, who ruled Venice from 991 AD, Venetian attention towards mainland Veneto was definitely overshadowed by a strong push towards the control of the Adriatic Sea. Inner strife was pacified, and trade with the Byzantine Empire boosted by the favourable treaty (Grisobolus or Golden Bull) with Emperor Basil II. The imperial edict granted Venetian traders freedom from taxation paid by other foreigners and the Byzantines themselves. In 1000 AD an expedition of Venetian ships in coastal Istria and Dalmatia secured Venetian suzerainty in the area, and the Narentine pirates were suppressed permanently. On this occasion Doge Orseolo named himself ""Duke of Dalmatia"", starting the colonial empire of Venice. He was also responsible of the establishment of the famous ""Marriage of the Sea"" ceremony. At this time Venice had a firm control over the Adriatic Sea, strengthened by the expedition of Pietro's son Ottone in 1017.

The creation of Venice's overseas empire began with the conquest of Dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal extent at the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, with the declaration of the acquisition of three octaves of the Byzantine Empire.

In 1409, during the 20-year Hungarian civil war between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou, the losing contender, Ladislaus of Naples, sold his ""rights"" on Dalmatia to the Venetian Republic for a meager sum of 100,000 ducats. Sigismund tried to recover the territory but Venice defeated his troops in the battle of Motta.

The more centralized merchant republic took control of the cities by 1420 (with the exception of the Republic of Ragusa); they were to remain under Venetian rule for a period of 377 years (1420–1797). The southernmost area of Dalmatia (now part of coastal Montenegro) was called Venetian Albania during that time.

Ottoman–Venetian Wars

In the period between the start of the Ottoman–Venetian War (1499–1503) and the end of Ottoman–Venetian War (1537–40), the Ottoman Empire made significant advances in the Dalmatian hinterland - it didn't occupy the Venetian cities, but it took the Croatian possessions between Skradin and Karin, eliminating them as a buffer zone between the Ottoman and Venetian territory. The economy of the Venetian cities in Dalmatia, severely impacted by the Turkish occupation of the hinterland in the previous war, recovered and held steady even throughout this war.

Cretan War

The Dalmatian front was a separate theater of operations, which was involved in the early phase of the war. The conditions there were almost reverse to those in Crete: for the Ottomans, it was too far away and relatively insignificant, while the Venetians operated near their own bases of supply and had undisputed control of the sea, being thus able to easily reinforce their coastal strongholds. The Ottomans launched a large-scale attack in 1646, and made some significant gains, including the capture of the islands of Krk, Pag and Cres, and most importantly, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Novigrad, which surrendered on 4 July, after only two days of bombardment. The Turks were now able to threaten the two main Venetian strongholds in Dalmatia, Zadar and Split. In the next year however, the tide turned, as the Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the fortress of Knin and took Klis, while a month-long siege of the fortress of Šibenik by the Ottomans in August and September failed. During the next few years, military operations stalled because of an outbreak of famine and plague amongst the Venetians at Zadar, while both sides focused their resources in the Aegean area. As other fronts took priority for the Ottomans, no further operations occurred in the Dalmatian theater. Peace in 1669 found the Republic of Venice with significant gains in Dalmatia, its territory tripled, and its control of the Adriatic thus secured.

Morean War

In October 1683, the population of Venetian Dalmatia, principally Uskoks of Ravni kotari, took arms and together with the rayah (lower class) of the Ottoman frontier regions rose up, taking Skradin, Karin, Vrana, Benkovac and Obrovac.

In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled.

On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa.

The ""Linea Mocenigo""  in 1718 Dalmatia was named after Sebastiano Mocenigo, one of the last famous Doges of Venice. Indeed, in Dalmatia -after the Treaty of Passarowitz- he obtained some small advances for his Dalmatia, taking the areas of Signo and Imoschi in the hinterland. That was the last enlargement of Venetian Dalmatia (that partially enjoyed the ""Age of Enlightment"" experienced by Venice during Illuminism) until the Napoleon conquest in 1797.

Last decades

In 1797 AD, during the Napoleonic wars, the Republic of Venice was dissolved. The Venetian Dalmatia was included in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy from 1805 to 1809 AD (the Republic of Ragusa was included in 1808 AD), and later in the Illyrian Provinces from 1809 AD. After the final defeat of Napoleon, the entire territory was granted to the Austrian Empire by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 AD.

Demographic history

Venetian Dalmatia was inhabited by autochthonous Romance-speaking people and by Slavic-speaking people (who arrived in Dalmatia after 640 AD).  The Romance population spoke the Dalmatian language and the Venetian language, and also Italian language and Latin language.  However, it is possible that ethnically, the Venetians were an earlier arrival of Slavic people, given that the name Veneti has etymological connection to ""Wend,"" the German word for ""Slav"", and Tacitus informs us that the ""Adriatic Veneti"" of his period (AD 1st c.) were related to the ""Vistula Veneti,"" the region of Proto-Slavic homeland in Poland by the Vistula River.

The Slavonic Croat population spoke Shtokavian dialect of Slavonic which is today called Croatian. 

The Romance population had already become a minority in the Early Middle Ages, living mostly in the coastal areas, with smaller pockets in the hinterland. Merchants and soldiers from Venice settled the Dalmatian cities over the centuries, mixing with the already present Romance population. During Ottoman rule in the hinterlands Orthodox people, mostly Serbs, started arriving in the northern parts of the hinterland, as well as Romance-speaking Vlachs, part of whom were Orthodox and part of whom were Catholic, and after the Venetian takeover of most of the hinterland during the Great Turkish War the Croat population in the hinterlands was greatly reinforced by new Croat settlers fleeing from Ottoman Bosnia. Over time the Croats assimilated the Catholic Vlachs, while the Serbs assimilated the Orthodox ones. The Romance-speakers in the coastal areas were more resilient to assimilation (in great part due to their prestige status) and after the fall of the Republic, during the national movements of the 19th century, had mostly adopted an Italian national identity.

The Dalmatian population adhered to Roman Catholicism in the maritime areas, the urban areas on the coast as well as much of the hinterland, while Eastern Orthodoxy was dominant in the northern part of the hinterland, as Serbs and Orthodox Vlachs settled the area from the 16th century onwards.

Legacy

The legacy from Venice in Dalmatia is huge and very important, mainly in the cultural and artistic area. Venice was one of the centers of Italian Renaissance, when the Republic of Venice dominated Dalmatia, and the Venetian Dalmatia enjoyed the benefits of this fact. From Giorgio Orsini to the influence on the early contemporary Croatian literature, Venice made its Dalmatia the most western-oriented civilized area of the Balkans, mostly in the cities.

Some architectural works from that period of Dalmatia are of European importance, and would contribute to further development of the Renaissance: the Cathedral of St James in Šibenik and the Chapel of Blessed John in Trogir.

Indeed, the Croatian renaissance, strongly influenced by Venetian and Italian literature, was thoroughly developed on the coastal parts of Croatia. The beginning of the Croatian 16th-century literal activity was marked by a Dalmatian humanist Marco Marulo and his epic book Judita, which has been written by incorporating peculiar motives and events from the classical Bible, and adapting them to the contemporary literature in Europe.

In 1997 the historical city-island of Trogir (called ""Tragurium"" in Latin when was one of the Dalmatian City-States and ""Traù"" in venetian) was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. ""The orthogonal street plan of this island...was embellished by successive rulers with many fine public and domestic buildings and fortifications. Its beautiful Romanesque churches are complemented by the outstanding Renaissance and Baroque buildings from the Venetian period"", says the UNESCO report. Trogir is the best-preserved Romanesque-Gothic complex not only in the Adriatic, but in all of Central Europe. Trogir's medieval core, surrounded by walls, comprises a venetian well-preserved castle and tower (Kamerlengo Castle) and a series of dwellings and palaces from the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque periods. Trogir's grandest building is the church of St. Lawrence, whose main west portal is a masterpiece by Radovan, and the most significant work of the Romanesque-Gothic style in Croatia.

The Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition states on page 774 ""Antiquities"" that:
""... from Italy (and Venice) came the Romanesque. The belfry of S. Maria, at Zara, erected in 1105, is first in a long list of Romanesque buildings. At Arbe there is a beautiful Romanesque campanile which also belongs to the 12th century; but the finest example in this style is the cathedral of Trau. The 14th century Dominican and Franciscan convents in Ragusa are also noteworthy. Romanesque lingered on in Dalmatia until it was displaced by Venetian Gothic in the early years of the 15th century. The influence of Venice was then at its height. Even in the relatively hostile Republic of Ragusa the Romanesque of the custom-house and Rectors' palace is combined with Venetian Gothic, while the graceful balconies and ogee windows of the Prijeki closely follow their Venetian models. In 1441 Giorgio Orsini of Zara, summoned from Venice to design the cathedral of Sebenico, brought with him the influence of the Italian Renaissance. The new forms which he introduced were eagerly imitated and developed by other architects, until the period of decadence - which virtually concludes the history of Dalmatian art - set in during the latter half of the 17th century. Special mention must be made of the carved woodwork, embroideries and plate preserved in many churches. The silver statuette and the reliquary of St. Biagio at Ragusa, and the silver ark of St. Simeon at Zara, are fine specimens of Italian jewelers' work, ranging in date from the 11th or 12th to the 17th century ..."".

In the 19th century, the cultural influence from Venice and the Italian peninsula originated the editing in Zara  of the first Dalmatian newspaper, in Italian and Croatian: Il Regio Dalmata – Kraglski Dalmatin, founded and published by the Italian Bartolomeo Benincasa in 1806 AD. Furthermore, this Kraglski Dalmatin was stamped in the typography of Antonio Luigi Battara and was the first fully done in Croatian.

Governors
 
The Provveditore generale (Governor-general) was the official name of Venetian state officials supervising Dalmatia. The Governors of Dalmatia were based in Zara, while they were under direct supervision of the Provveditore Generale da Mar, who was based in Corfu and was directly controlled by the Signoria of Venice.

Summary
During summer the club transferred out 13 players and bought several players such as right back Defender Jocelyn Angloma from Internazionale, centre-back Defender Miroslav Đukić from Deportivo La Coruña, left back Defender Amedeo Carboni, midfielder Marcelinho Carioca (lasting just 6 months) and Romário returned from Flamengo only to be injured in pre-season and left the team in December. The squad started poorly with three consecutive losses and Jorge Valdano was sacked being appointed Claudio Ranieri as new manager in October. Meanwhile, the bad streak of results prompted President Paco Roig to quit the job after three years in charge, and later the shareholders appointed Pedro Cortes (former President in 1986) as its new chairman. After a chaotic first half of the campaign, the squad improved its performance in the second part of the campaign thanks to Ranieri's team handling to boost the upcoming midfield youngstars Gaizka Mendieta, Miguel Angulo, Francisco Javier Farinos and Forward Adrian Ilie  who arrived to the club in late December and scored 12 goals.

The team finished in a disappointing 9th spot in League being classified to next 1998 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Also, in Copa del Rey the squad was defeated in two legs by FC Barcelona being eliminated in Eightfinals.

The highest ever attendance for a UEFA competition match was in the 1969–70 European Cup semi-final at Hampden Park, Scotland's national stadium. A record 136,505 people attended the match between Celtic and Leeds United. The attendance of 149,415 for the Scotland vs. England international match of 1937 at Hampden Park is also a European record. The attendance of 147,365 for the 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen at Hampden Park is a European record for a club match. Rangers' record attendance of 118,567 at Ibrox is a British record for a league match.

By club

Current SPFL member clubs
This is a list of all 42 Scottish Professional Football League clubs' record match attendances at their home ground. The vast majority of these records were achieved before the advent of all-seater stadia. The cost of building all-seater grounds, and a general decline in attendances, means the present capacities of the clubs stadiums are well below their record attendances. Some records were achieved at a club's previous ground, rather than their current location. For example, Clyde's record was set at Shawfield Stadium, whilst they have since moved to Broadwood Stadium. Records set while ground-sharing or at a venue other than the club's home stadium are not included. For example, Celtic were the home team when 136,505 attended their 1969–70 European Cup semi-final second leg match against Leeds United, but the match was played at Hampden Park, not Celtic Park. Rangers' record attendance of 118,567 is also the British record for a league match.

The attendance of 136,274 for the 1952 Scottish Cup Final between Motherwell and Dundee is a Scottish record for a match not involving Celtic, Rangers or the Scotland national team.

While less than 50% of the all-time record crowds at Hampden, the attendance of 72,069 at the 1989 Scottish Cup Final has become a landmark figure as no match in Scotland has come close to matching it since, owing to subsequent stadium modernisation which left no venue with a greater capacity.

214,3909940,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghar%20el-Melh,Ghar el-Melh,"Ghar el-Melh (, Ghar al-Milh, ""Salt Grotto""), the classical Rusucmona and CastraDelia and colonial  is a town and former port on the southern side of Cape Farina in Bizerte Governorate, Tunisia.

History

Phoenician colony
The Phoenician settlement at Ghar el-Melha little inland from the present sitebegan around the same time as Utica and its dating presents the same problems. Several classical authors place northern Tunisia's colonization BC but modern archaeology has only found evidence suggestive of a date closer to BC. In either case, the settlement at Ghar el-Melh came to serve as Utica's chief port as the Medjerda changed course and began silting up Utica's harbor. Its Punic name Rus Eshmun meant ""Cape Eshmun"", after the Punic name for Cape Farina.

Scipio Africanus landed nearby, took the town, and pillaged the surrounding countryside in 204BC ahead of his siege of Utica during the Second Punic War. A naval battle ending in Roman victory was fought off the town's coast the next year, ahead of Zama and the end of the war.

Roman city
The port fell under Roman rule along with the rest of the Carthaginian Empire during the course of the Punic Wars. It sometimes preserved its former nameLatinized as Rusucmonabut also came to be known as  or Delia, presumably after Scipio's friend and lieutenant G. Laelius. Its peninsula preserved an ancient and important temple to ""Apollo"", probably representing a continuation of the Carthaginian worship of the healing god Eshmun harmonized with the Greco-Roman pantheon.  held native city () status as part of the province of Byzacena. It flourished from around 30BC to around AD330. During this time the city was also the seat of a Christian bishopric.

Pirate base
Much later, it became an important base for the Barbary corsairs. Following the conquest of Tunisia by CharlesV in 1534 and 1535, Spaniards tried to remove the pirates unsuccessfully. John of Austria also visited the bay during his reconquest of Tunis in October 1573, following his victory at Lepanto.

The Italian convert, Ottoman corsair, and Tunisian dey Usta Murad expanded the citythen known as PortoFarinagreatly enough to consider it a second founding. He established fortifications to prevent the harbor's use by Christian powers and attracted refugee Moriscos by the provision of certain liberties at Porto Farina, Rafraf, and Ras el-Djebel. During this era, it rivaled the size and importance of Bizerte.

In early 1655, an English fleet under Robert Blake blockaded nine warships in Porto Farina's harbor in order to pressure the dey Mustafa Laz to free Englishmen held as slaves and to provide compensation for English ships recently seized by local pirates. The dey offered to provide a new treaty going forward but refused emancipation or compensation for people and ships already taken. Any such action, he felt, should begin with the English, one of whose captains had recently sold a company of Tunisian troops as galley slaves to the Knights of Malta instead of transporting them to Smyrna (present-day Izmir) as arranged. When Blake maintained his blockade, the dey had his warships' rigging removed, the town's fortifications strengthened, and its garrison increased. On April 14, 1655, Blake finally attacked. Dividing his fleet to attack the warships and the 20-gun fort simultaneously, he had his men storm and burn the warships in turn before declaring victory and leaving the harbor. Because his sustained assault was able to silence the town's defenses entirely, the engagement is celebrated as the first successful naval attack on shore-based fortifications.

The port and its defenses were then quickly rebuilt. The Ottoman Empire erected Borj el-Loutani as a fort in 1659; Fort Nadur and the ""Genovese fort"" were also raised around the same time. Borj el-Loutani was later used as an artillery base and as a prison; the others gradually fell into disrepair. The town began to be used by British and Maltese privateers, as well as Turkish and local corsairs.

Muhammad Talak and Ali Bey were arrested and strangled in Porto Farina in 1682 as part of the chaotic struggles of the later Muradid dynasty. Shortly afterward, three ships arriving from Turkey proper infected the town with the plague.

When Husain I took advantage of Ibrahim Sharif's Algerian imprisonment to usurp control of Tunisia in 1705, the Algerians released Sharif to return home. Husain, intent upon consolidating his power, had Sharif killed en route at Porto Farina. The former dey's tomb lies beside one of the town's forts. Husain established an arsenal at Porto Farina two years later.

Locals were calling the town Ghar el-Melh (recorded by a visiting Frenchman as ""Gramela"") by 1724. French annoyance at piracy in the area prompted  to order an attack in 1770 by Admiral de Broves, commanding a squadron consisting of 2 warships (bearing 74 and 50 guns respectively), 2 frigates (24 guns each), a bark (18 guns), 2 schooners, a flute, and some other ships provided by Hospitaller Malta. The ships fired on Porto Farina for two days. De Brove's fleet also attacked Bizerte and Monastir before the Treaty of Bardo ended hostilities on August 25.

Similarly, when Venice took exception to Tunisian-based piracy in the early 1780s, its leaders ordered a series of bombardments that included an attack by Admiral Emo's fleet on Porto Farina on September 6, 1784. This seems, however, to have been the last time a foreign fleet bothered the port; by 1806, it was only a winter port for the bey's warships and it was necessary to take special measures each voyage to get them over the harbor's rising sandbar.

The beylik's arsenal was finally removed in 1818, but fear that a similar fate might befall its navy as had Algeria's caused the bey to hire dredgers and workers to improve conditions.; he was again able to bring his fleet into the harbor by December. When a severe storm destroyed the beylik's fleet at anchor off La Goulette on February 7 & 8, 1821, however, such efforts were discontinued and the sandbar off Porto Farina was allowed to continue to grow.

Modern town
In 1834 a large private arsenal belonging to a Maltese pirate exploded and destroyed part of the town. Ahmed Bey, the last Bey of Constantine, decided to clamp down on piracy and attempted to turn the port over to legitimate trade. In 1837, he began efforts to restore the town's arsenal. Although that never proved feasible, the bey established a palace in the city and an attendant garrison. Command was given to a favorite of the bey's, the general Salah Cheboul. The forts were renovated, and the port cleaned and maintained. From 1840, a community of Maltese, Italians, and French settled in the locality. By 1853, however, the beylik's new frigates could no longer access the harbor and the garrison was reduced.

In the early years of Tunisia's French occupation, the Bizerte Port Company () made an attempt to again dredge access to Porto Farina's harbor but a storm from the northeast closed the channel almost immediately after its opening and further attempts were abandoned. The formerly prosperous town's public buildings had already fallen into disrepair and were thoroughly scavenged by locals for other purposes. The prison, which was listed as a Tunisian Historic Monument in 1922, closed in 1964. Today Ghar el-Melh is a small farming town.

Religion
The ancient bishopric survives today as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church and the current bishop is Geoffrey James Robinson of Australia.

215,46367845,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca%20macronychia,Melaleuca macronychia,"Melaleuca macronychia is a shrub in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. Its large, red flower spikes and long flowering period contribute to its popularity as a garden plant. There are two subspecies, distinguished mainly by the shape of the leaves.

Description
Melaleuca macronychia is an open, erect, many-stemmed shrub usually growing to a height of . Its leaves are arranged alternately, are  long and  wide oval to narrow elliptic in shape and taper to a point.

The flowers are crimson and arranged in spikes on side branches, the spikes up to  long and about  in diameter. Each spike contains between 10 and 80 individual flowers. The petals are  long and fall off as the flowers open. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 15 to 25 stamens. Flowers appear mostly from February to December varying somewhat with subspecies. The fruit are woody, roughly spherical capsules about  in diameter, forming clusters along the branches.

Taxonomy and naming
Melaleuca macronychia was first described in 1852 by Nikolai Turczaninow in ""Bulletin de la classe physico-mathematique de l'Academie Imperiale des sciences de Saint-Petersburg"". There is disagreement about the etymology of the specific epithet (macronychia). In a Melaleuca monograph, Craven give it as from the Ancient Greek makros meaning “long” and onyx meaning ""fingernail"", ""claw"" or ""talon"", referring to the dried leaves which look like long, narrow human fingernails. Sharr considers onychius to be an adaptation of the Greek onyx, onychos meaning ""a nail or claw"", referring to the stamen claw of this species.

There are two subspecies varying in their distributions, flowering time and leaf size and shape:
 Melaleuca macronychia subsp. macronychia has narrow oval to elliptic leaves that are up to ten times longer than they are wide and it occurs in and between the Kalannie and Hyden districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions.
 Melaleuca macronychia subsp. trygonoides has broad oval leaves which are less than twice as long as they are wide and it occurs in the Coolgardie, Lake Johnston and Widgiemooltha districts in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions.

Distribution and habitat
Melaleuca macronychia occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions growing in scrub and heath on a wide range of sandy and gravelly soil types.

Conservation
This species is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife although the subspecies trygonoides is classified as ""Priority Three"" meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

Use in horticulture
Melaleuca macronychia subsp. macronychia is frequently cultivated because of its profuse red flower spikes which appear over long periods. It is also a hardy plant, including in the temperate areas of the more humid east coast when grown in well-drained soil with a sunny aspect.

Descended from a noble family who were lords of Brinon, barons of Didonne-sur-Marche, Saint-Germain-sur-Vienne and Brillac as well as holding other lordships in the Auvergne, and Counts of Saint-Victour in the Peerage of France, his father was François de Saint-Nectaire (died 1710), comte de Brinon (cr. 1608) (styled comte de Saint-Nectaire), and his mother was Marie daughter of Charles de Béchillon, baron d'Irlaud.

Life
He joined the French Army as a lieutenant, was promoted to captain and then colonel (1705) of the Senneterre Dragoons, before serving in Italy in 1703 and 1704, and then in Flanders and on the Rhine from 1705 to 1713. Appointed brigadier in 1719 and colonel of the Marche Infantry in 1731, he fought in the Italian campaigns of 1734 and 1735 under Marshal François de Franquetot de Coigny, being promoted Maréchal de camp in 1734.
 
In 1735, King Louis XV was sent as special envoy to the King of Sardinia.

As lieutenant-general, in 1744 he commanded a division of the French Army during the attack on Villefranche during the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1745 he led military operations in the siege of Casal and the following year took part in Marshal de Maillebois's retreat when faced by superior Austrian and Sardinian forces. De Saint-Nectaire was summoned to join the French Forces in Flanders in 1747 and 1748, and on 24 February 1757 he was promoted Marshal of France. 

He refurbished the Château de Didonne as a country residence, circa 1730, which is now the Musée du Matériel agricole. He also considerably extended the family estates by buying the marquisate of Pisany in 1738, the baronies of Arvert and Saujon in 1758, the castellany of Le Chay in 1764, the lordship of Chênaumoine and a moiety of the lordship of La Touche. 

His son, Henri-Charles (1714–1785), was accorded the courtesy title of comte before succeeding, in 1756, as marquis de Saint-Nectaire. He made many improvements to the family's estates, which later devolved upon the marshal's granddaughter, Marie-Charlotte, marquise d'Armentières.

Marriage and issue
On 7 October 1711 he married Marie-Marthe, daughter of Henri, marquis de Saint-Pierre et de Saint-Julien, by his wife Marie-Madeleine Boisseret d'Herblay. Their only child, Henri-Charles, a Colonel in the Infantry, who succeeded as marquis de Saint-Nectaire, married in 1738 Marie-Louise, daughter of Philippe-Emmanuel de Crussol d'Uzès, marquis de Saint-Sulpice, by whom he had two children:
Marie-Charlotte (14 November 1750 – 26 July 1794, Paris), dame du fief de Songeons (1777–1778), married in 1770 Louis de Brienne de Conflan, marquis d'Armentières;
Charles-Emmanuel (1752 - 1783), Lieutenant-Colonel of the Régiment de Hainault.

224,428608,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris%20Leslie,Chris Leslie,"Christopher Michael Leslie (born 28 June 1972) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Shipley from 1997 to 2005 and Nottingham East from 2010 to 2019. A former member of the Labour Party, he defected to form Change UK and later became an independent politician.

Born in Keighley, Leslie was educated at Bingley Grammar School and graduated from the University of Leeds with a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Parliamentary Studies and a Master of Arts in Industrial and Labour Studies. After working as an office administrator and political researcher, he was elected to Parliament for Shipley aged 24 at the 1997 general election.

Leslie was a minister in the Department for Constitutional Affairs from 2001 to 2005 but lost his seat at the 2005 general election. He was director of the New Local Government Network think-tank from 2005 until being elected for Nottingham East at the 2010 general election.

Between May and September 2015, Leslie served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in the shadow cabinet of acting Labour leader Harriet Harman. In 2018, he lost a motion of no confidence by his constituency party. In February 2019, Leslie left Labour alongside six other MPs in protest at the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn to form The Independent Group, later Change UK.

Early life (1972–1997)
Leslie was born in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, and attended Bingley Grammar School before becoming a student at the University of Leeds, graduating in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Parliamentary Studies. From 1994 to 1996, he was an office administrator and gained a Master of Arts in Industrial and Labour Studies in 1996, afterwards becoming a political research assistant in Bradford. He was elected to Parliament a month before his 25th birthday.

Parliamentary career

In Parliament (1997–2005)
Leslie gained the seat of Shipley as a Labour Co-operative candidate in the 1997 general election defeating Marcus Fox, the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee and Shipley's Conservative MP since 1970. In the process, Leslie overturned a 12,382 majority, to return a 2,966 majority of his own. It was the neighbouring seat to his hometown of Keighley, another seat taken by Labour from the Conservatives in 1997.

Leslie was the Baby of the House when he first entered the Commons, remaining so until June 2000 when David Lammy, three weeks Leslie’s junior, was elected. He was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Falconer for three-and-a-half years. Leslie held his seat in 2001, but his majority was reduced by a half to 1,428.

Shortly before his 30th birthday, he became a junior minister in the Cabinet Office in 2001, following the recent election. In 2002, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. He then moved to spend almost two years as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, working again under Falconer from 2003 to 2005. He never rebelled against a Government position during his first time in Parliament including voting in favour of the invasion of Iraq in March 2003.

In the 2005 general election, Leslie lost his seat to Conservative candidate Philip Davies, by fewer than 500 votes.

Out of Parliament (2005–10)
Leslie led Gordon Brown's successful (and uncontested) campaign for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2007. Having lost his seat in Shipley, in 2005, he became the director of the New Local Government Network, which was described in the Local Government Chronicle in 2001 as a ""Blairite think-tank"".

On 14 April 2010, he was selected as the Labour parliamentary candidate for Nottingham East in the general election campaign, after the National Executive Committee imposed a shortlist and selection panel, following the late resignation of the MP John Heppell.

Return to Parliament (2010–2019)
Leslie returned to Parliament at the 2010 general election, representing Nottingham East.

He supported Ed Balls for the leadership of the Labour Party during the 2010 leadership election following the resignation of Gordon Brown, voting for David Miliband as his second preference.

In September 2011, he stood in the shadow cabinet elections but missed out on becoming a shadow cabinet minister, however he was promoted to Her Majesty's Opposition becoming Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury. On 7 October 2013, he was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet, becoming Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In May 2015, he was promoted to Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, replacing Ed Balls, who had lost his parliamentary seat in the 2015 general election. In this role he opposed Labour's proposals for rent controls, while receiving income as a residential landlord himself.

Leslie supported Yvette Cooper in the 2015 Labour leadership election, and was critical of the economic policies of Jeremy Corbyn, calling them ""starry-eyed, hard left"". On 12 September 2015, Leslie resigned from the Labour front bench following the election of Corbyn as party leader. Leslie is a supporter of Labour Friends of Israel and Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East.

In June 2018 Leslie published a pamphlet through the Social Market Foundation, where he is a member of the Policy Advisory Board, entitled Centre Ground: Six Values of Mainstream Britain. In August the same year The Guardian reported that ""many saw the document as laying the intellectual groundwork for a future new [political] party,"" however Leslie denied this.

Vote of No confidence
In September 2018, Leslie lost a vote of no confidence brought by his Constituency Labour Party and became the fourth Labour MP to have such a motion passed against him. The motion, brought by members of the Mapperley branch of Nottingham East, criticised Leslie for his ""disloyalty and deceit"", which it dubbed ""a severe impediment to Labour Party electability"", and as ""incompatible"" with Leslie continuing as the Labour candidate. Leslie did not attend the vote and had earlier remarked that the party had been infiltrated by the ""intolerant hard left"". Centrist Labour MPs rallied around Leslie online.

The Independent Group 
On 18 February 2019, Leslie and six other MPs (Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey) quit Labour in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to form The Independent Group, later Change UK. He continued to serve as a Change UK MP after six of its 11 MPs left the party in June 2019. He lost the Nottingham East constituency to the Labour candidate Nadia Whittome in the 2019 general election, losing his deposit with 3.6% of the vote.

Life after parliament
In July 2020, Leslie was appointed chief executive of the Credit Services Association, the trade association of the UK debt collection and purchase industry.

Personal life
In February 2005, he married Nicola Murphy, a special adviser to Gordon Brown, in Westminster; the couple became engaged the previous year. In April 2016, Nicola Murphy founded Labour Tomorrow, an organisation which funded Labour-connected activists and groups who oppose Jeremy Corbyn as party leader.

226,6114122,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarafa%20%28giraffe%29,Zarafa (giraffe),"Zarafa (1825 – 12 January 1845) was a female Nubian giraffe who lived in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris for 18 years. A gift from Muhammad Ali of Egypt to King Charles X of France, she was one of three giraffes Muhammad Ali sent to European rulers in 1827. These were the first giraffes to be seen in Europe for over three centuries, since the Medici giraffe was sent to Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence in 1486.  She didn't receive the name ""Zarafa"" until 1985.

Background
The giraffe known today as Zarafa was one among a series of diplomatic gifts exchanged between Charles X of France and the Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt, Mehmet Ali Pasha, to enhance their relationship.

Biography
The young Nubian giraffe was captured by Arab hunters near Sennar in Sudan and first taken by camel, then sailed by felucca on the Blue Nile to Khartoum. From there she was transported down the Nile on a specially constructed barge to Alexandria.  She was accompanied by three cows that provided her with 25 litres of milk each day.

From Alexandria, she embarked on a ship to Marseilles, with an Arab groom, Hassan, and Drovetti's Sudanese servant, Atir.  Because of her height, a hole was cut through the deck above the cargo hold through which she could poke her neck.  After a voyage of 32 days, she arrived in Marseilles on 31 October 1826.  Fearing the dangers of transporting her by boat to Paris around the Iberian peninsula and up the Atlantic coast of France to the Seine, it was decided that she should walk the 900 km to Paris.

She over-wintered in Marseilles, where she was joined by the naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for the walk.  He ordered a two-part yellow coat to keep her warm, and shoes for her feet.  She set out on 20 May 1827, already 15 cm taller than when she arrived in Marseilles.  She was accompanied by her cows and Saint-Hilaire, then aged 55, who walked with her.  The trip to Paris took 41 days.  She was a spectacle in each town she passed through, Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, Orange, Montelimar and Vienne.  She arrived in Lyon on 6 June, where she was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of 30,000.

She was presented to the King at the chateau of Saint-Cloud in Paris on 9 July 1827, and took up residence in the Jardin des Plantes.  Now standing nearly 4 m high, Zarafa's arrival in Paris caused a sensation.  Over 100,000 people came to see her, approximately an eighth of the population of Paris at the time.  Honoré de Balzac wrote a story about her; Gustave Flaubert (then a young child) travelled from Rouen to see her.   La mode à la girafe swept the nation; hair was arranged in towering styles, spotted fabrics were all the rage. The Journal des Dames reported that the color known as ""belly of giraffe"" became extremely popular.  Porcelain and other ceramics were painted with giraffe images.  She was painted by Nicolas Huet, Jacques Raymond Brascassat and many others.

Zarafa remained in Paris for a further 18 years until her death, attended to the end by Atir.  Her corpse was stuffed and displayed in the foyer of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris for many years, before being moved to the Museum of Natural History of La Rochelle, where it remains.

Names

According to Saint-Hilaire, she was called le bel animal du roi (""The Beautiful Animal of the King"") during her trip from Marseille to Paris and she was dubbed la Belle Africaine (""the Beautiful African"") by contemporary press. La Gazette referred to her as ""her Highness"" (pun intended).

The name ""Zarafa"" was given to her by American author Michael Allin in his 1998 book Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story, from Deep in Africa to the Heart of Paris. Zarafa, meaning ""charming"" or ""lovely one"" in Arabic, is a phonetic variant of the Arabic word for giraffe: zerafa. Olivier Lebleu, author of the new preface to the second edition (2007) of the French journalist Gabriel Dardaud's book Une giraffe pour le roi (the first modern full-length work about France's first giraffe) has taken up the name ""Zarafa,"" as have several other recent authors, including Lebleu himself in his 2006 book Les Avatars de Zarafa. In addition, the eponymous 2012 French animation film, Zarafa uses the name; and even the museum in La Rochelle, where her mounted remains still greet visitors, now refers to her by the name Zarafa.

Other giraffe gifts by Muhammad Ali

Muhammad Ali Pasha also sent two other giraffes as gifts in 1827, one to George IV of the United Kingdom in London and the other to Francis I of Austria in Vienna.  Like the giraffe sent to France, both inspired giraffe crazes in their respective cities.  The Austrian giraffe joined the Emperor's menagerie at Schönbrunn Palace but survived for less than one year.  Nevertheless, it lived on in the form of Giraffeln pastries, served until the beginning of the First World War, and Giraffentorten (giraffe cakes) which still can be found.  The English giraffe (or ""cameleopard"", echoing the terminology used by Pliny) joined the embryonic London Zoo in Regent's Park.  It was painted as The Nubian Giraffe in 1827 by Jacques-Laurent Agasse, in an image that includes Edward Cross and, in the background, the giraffe's milk cows from Egypt.  The English giraffe survived for less than two years, and was stuffed by John Gould.

Biography 
Ruthven was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in November 1924. After serving in the U.S. military in World War II, Ruthven attended the Art Academy of Cincinnati and received his certificate in 1947. He opened a commercial art studio in Cincinnati.  His work for clients included the Play-Doh Boy, used in that product's original 1950s advertising.  Ruthven's focus, however, was on wildlife painting in the style of John James Audubon.  In 1960, his painting ""Redhead Ducks"" won the Federal Duck Stamp competition.

Ruthven's wildlife paintings are on display at many museums including the Smithsonian Institution, and his work was featured in a 1994 retrospective at the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History.  He designed two pigs for Cincinnati's Big Pig Gig in 2000. Other artwork includes a Passenger pigeon mural on the wall of a six-story building in Cincinnati which can be seen in the 2014 documentary From Billions To None by David Mrazek and Joel Greenberg.  The mural is located at 15 8th Street.

Ruthven was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2004. He later lived on a farm near Georgetown, Ohio and died in October 2020 at the age of 95.

228,23146561,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIAI%20RK-I,NIAI RK-I,"The RK-I (Razdvizhnoye Krylo - Istrebitel – extending wing - fighter) (a.k.a. RK-2) was a two-seat cabin aircraft designed and built in the USSR from October 1938.

Development 
In 1930 the LIIPS (Leningrad institute for sail and communications engineers) formed a UK GVF (training centre for civil air fleet), in turn the UK GVF formed the NIAI (Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Aero-Institoot - scientific test aero-institute) which became the focus of several good design engineers who were given command of individual OKB (Osboye Konstrooktorskoye Byuro – personal design/construction bureau).

Along with contemporary aircraft designers, in Russia and abroad, Grigorii Ivanovich Bakshayev was interested in the concept of variable geometry aircraft, where the size and/or shape of wings are altered according to the stage of flight, or desired characteristics. There are many methods of achieving this but one of the simplest is the telescopic wing, where wing sections of bigger area and, possibly, aerofoil section, are telescoped out over the original wing. Bakshayev designed the RK-I to use a telescopic wing with fifteen sections, of gradually increasing size, extending outwards from the fuselage to the demands of the pilot.

The RK-I fuselage was of light-alloy semi-monocoque construction with a conventional tail unit. The retractable tail-wheel undercarriage was attached to the fuselage, giving the aircraft a very narrow track, retracting into the fuselage and covered by doors. To reduce drag the engine sat in the nose, under a closely fitting cowling, and cooling radiators sat in ducts either side of the rear fuselage fed by long pipework.

The wings of the RK-I were very unusual in having tandem main-planes, used as guide tracks and supports for the hydraulically extending wing sections, which more than doubled the wing area when fully extended. The wings were of light-alloy and steel structure with 30KhGSA steel skins, only the rear wing having flaps and ailerons.
Unfortunately for the RK-I Joseph Stalin was very interested in the project and insisted that the most powerful engine then available was used in the aircraft. This was the death-knell for the RK-I as the most powerful engine then available was the M-106 which was, unfortunately, a complete failure, not progressing further than bench testing. Construction of the RK-I was complete by 1940, but the aircraft remained un-flown in the workshop due to the unreliable engine.

230,4239807,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviv%20Kochavi,Aviv Kochavi,"Rav-Aluf (Lieutenant General) Aviv Kochavi (; born 1964) is the Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, having taken the oath of office on January 15, 2019. He was the commander of the Gaza Division, commander of the Northern Command, commander of the Paratroopers Brigade and Military Intelligence Director.

Early life and education 
Kochavi was one of three children born to Shaul and Riva Kochavi. His father was a shop owner and his mother was a physical education teacher. His maternal grandfather and some of his brothers immigrated to Israel from Russia before World War II. His paternal grandfather's family lived in Krakow, Poland. His grandfather, Romek-Abraham, immigrated to Israel in the 1920s, and was one of the pioneers of Highway 75 and one of the founders of Kiryat Haim.

He grew up in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa District, and was a member of the HaMahanot HaOlim Labour Zionist youth movement. He studied at the Habonim school and ORT Kiryat Bialik school.

Kochavi has a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University and a master's degree in international relations from Johns Hopkins University.

Military career
Kochavi was drafted into the IDF in 1982. He volunteered as a paratrooper in the Paratroopers Brigade and was placed in the 890th Battalion. He served as a soldier and a squad leader. In 1985 he became an infantry officer after completing Officer Candidate School and returned to the Paratroopers Brigade as a platoon leader. During his career Kochavi led the Brigade's Anti-tank company. 

Between 1993 and 1994, he led the 101st ""Peten"" (Elapidae) paratroop battalion in counter-guerrilla operations in South Lebanon. Afterwards he commanded a Regional Brigade in South Lebanon and a reserve Paratrooper Brigade. Later he commanded the training base of the brigade, was deputy commander of the brigade and commander of the reservist paratrooper 551 brigade.

Commander of the Paratroopers Brigade 

In 2001, he was appointed commander of the Paratroopers Brigade, a position he held until 2003. Together with a group of other commanders from the field units, including Moshe Tamir, Yair Golan, Gal Hirsch and Noam Tibon, he was one of the pushers to act against the sources of Palestinian militancy during the Second Intifada in the kasbahs and refugee camps, despite being crowded and complicated urban areas, and despite the hesitations of the IDF senior command. He successfully led the brigade in a takeover of the Balata refugee camp in Nablus in February 2002.

He then led the brigade in Operation Defensive Shield, and in other operations throughout the West Bank against Palestinian militant infrastructure, among them, the conquest of Bethlehem and the imposition of a siege on the Church of the Nativity, in which fifty armed wanted men fortified themselves, held about 200 hostages and waged gun battles against the IDF.

In 2002 during the Second Intifada while on the battlefield, Kochavi developed the use of a 5 kg hammer to break down walls and cross through homes in refugee camps to prevent his soldiers from being shot by snipers. This tactic has been copied by other armies, including the United States military.

Brigadier general roles 
In 2003, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and appointed commander of the 98th Paratroopers Division, and served until November 2004. On November 30, 2004, he was appointed commander of the Gaza Division, and led the division in operations against Qassam rocket launches and Palestinian militants infrastructure in the Gaza Strip, including Operation Summer Rains. During his service as division commander, two significant events occurred: the disengagement plan in September 2005 and the abduction of Gilad Shalit in June 2006.

In 2007, he was appointed head of the Operations Division of the IDF's Operations Directorate, a position he held until January 2010, during which time he participated in the planning of Operation Cast Lead. After that, he served as a project manager in the Planning Directorate.

Major general roles 

He received the role of the chief of the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate in November 22, 2010. During his tenure, he took part in the planning of Operation Pillar of Defense, Operation Full Disclosure, Operation Brother's Keeper and Operation Protective Edge.

In November 2014 he was appointed as the commander of the Northern Command. During his tenure, the barrier against Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon was built, at the same time the command forces conducted activities to thwart militant infrastructure from Syrian territory, along with promoting a good neighborhood project called Operation Good Neighbor on the Syrian border.

On May 11, 2017 he was appointed as Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces. He served in this position until December 13, 2018.

Chief of the General Staff 
On October 26, 2018, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman recommended his appointment as the 22nd IDF Chief of Staff, with the consent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On November 25, the government approved his appointment. On January 15, 2019, he was promoted to the rank of Major General and began his service as Chief of Staff.

In November 2019 Kochavi commanded the IDF in Operation Black Belt, when it fought against the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), following the targeted killing of senior PIJ commander Baha Abu al-Ata in Gaza. He also led Israel's military during Operation Guardian of the Walls in May 2021. 

Later in May, Defense Minister Benny Gantz announced that he will request from the government to approve extending his tenure as IDF Chief of Staff by an additional year. In July, the government approved the extension of term.

Personal life
Kochavi is vegetarian, is married and is the father of three daughters. He lives in Adi.

Awards and decorations
Aviv Kochavi was awarded three campaign ribbons for his service during three conflicts.

235,52768918,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20of%20Bengal,Star of Bengal,"The Star of Bengal was an iron three-masted  merchant sailing vessel built in Belfast in 1874 by Harland and Wolff Industries (the shipyard that later constructed the Titanic). Though built towards the end of the Age of Sail, she was successfully operated for 24 years by the British trading company J.P. Corry & Co. The ship mainly travelled on the London-Calcutta trading route, but made a few voyages to Australian and American ports.

Following a formative change in the shipping industry, J.P. Corry switched to steam vessels and sold its sailing fleet around 1898. At the same time, merchant shipping along the United States Pacific Coast was experiencing a boom triggered by Klondike and Nome gold rushes intensifying the colonization of the Pacific Northwest and increasing the demand for both passenger and cargo shipping in the area. As a result, the Star of Bengal was purchased by San Francisco trading company J.J. Smith & Co. and, along with many other old European vessels, taken around Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean. J.J. Smith conducted an overhaul of the ship and re-rigged her from a full-rigged ship to a barque to decrease operating costs.

J.J. Smith operated the Star of Bengal for 7 more years, mainly hauling grain and coal. As steamships pushed sailing vessels out of business, the trading company could no longer operate her for profit, and in 1905, the Star of Bengal was sold to the Alaska Packers' Association. This company used its sailing ships for a single voyage a year: a spring sail carrying seasonal workers and supplies from San Francisco to one of its Alaskan canneries, followed by a return trip in early fall with the workers and a load of canned salmon.

On September 20, 1908, at the beginning of her return trip from Fort Wrangell to San Francisco, the Star of Bengal was in tow in open sea when she encountered a storm. The ship struck the rocks near the shore of Coronation Island and sunk, killing approximately 110 of 138 people aboard. Captain Nicholas Wagner survived the wreck and publicly blamed the tugboat captains for the event. After months of federal investigation, no one was held responsible. As of 2015, the wreck of the Star of Bengal remains among the top five worst maritime disasters in Alaskan history.

Later, Captain Wagner's daughter, Joan Lowell, pursued literary career, that led to the Star of Bengals portrayal in fiction. Her book The Cradle of the Deep, was the third-bestselling book of 1929 and contained an embellished account of the wreck. A melodramatic play, Star of Bengal, written by Thompson Buchanan and produced by Christopher Morley, is also set on the ship.

Specifications 
The Star of Bengal was built by shipbuilder Harland and Wolff Industries in Belfast, Ireland, in 1873 and 1874. Those were the years when the construction of three-masted iron ships reached its zenith, and the shipbuilding industry produced a series of the fastest ships in this category, the Star of Bengal being one of them.

Initially constructed as a two-deck three-masted full-rigged ship, in 1898 the Star of Bengal was re-rigged as a barque. Her gross tonnage was 1877, net tonnage 1694, and tonnage under deck, 1684. She was  long,  wide and  deep, and designed to be operated by a crew of seventeen. The ship could load  of deadweight cargo on a draught of .

The Star of Bengal had a  bar keel. Her poop deck was  long and forecastle,  long. The ship's moulded depth was  with freeboard of . She was originally constructed with three cement bulkheads, but after her overhaul in 1898, only one bulkhead remained in service. Overall, the ship's hull required  of stiffening.

History of operations

J.P. Corry & Co. 

The Star of Bengal was ordered by shipping company J.P. Corry & Co., which was founded in Belfast and  headquartered in London. At the time of her launch on January 3, 1874, the Star of Bengal was the largest vessel in gross tonnage in service of J.P. Corry & Co. (in December 1874, she was surpassed by the  Star of Russia). These two Stars remained the company's largest sailing vessels. The Star of Bengal's maiden voyage officially began on April 25, 1874, when she sailed out of London towards Melbourne. She continued to San Francisco and returned to Liverpool.

The company's sailing vessels operated three main trading routes, linking London with Canada, India, and Australia. The Star of Bengal largely remained on the London-Calcutta route, with occasional visits to Melbourne, Bombay, and Valparaíso. The ship's average time for the London-Calcutta-London round-trip was 7 months and 24 days. The shortest trip was 7 months and 2 days, and the longest 8 months and 14 days.

John Smyth was the Star of Bengal's first captain. He remained at this position for eleven years, until he took command of another company ship, the Star of Erin in 1885. He eventually graduated to commanding large company steamers, earning the unofficial title of ""the commodore of the Star fleet.""

William Legg became the next Star of Bengal's captain in 1885. During the ship's 1886 voyage to Calcutta, the Scottish maritime novelist George Cupples sailed as the Star of Bengal's honorary first mate. The ship arrived in Calcutta on August 19, 1886; shortly after her arrival, the captain broke his leg. Under the circumstances, the 63-year-old novelist successfully assumed command. The Star of Bengal was about to leave India and sail out of Garden Reach, when on September 25, the steamship Gulf of Mexico collided with the moored Star of Bengal, resulting in a month of repairs. Cupples finally sailed out on October 26, bringing the Star of Bengal back to London on February 1, 1887.

Upon arrival, Cupples yielded the captain's position to DeGruchy, who remained the ship's captain for one voyage. In 1888, William Legg returned to the Star of Bengal's command. In 1892, after four more years of service, he was replaced by John M. Hart, formerly John Smyth's first mate. Hart remained in command of the ship until 1898, when J.P. Corry & Co.'s decision to put its money into steamers led to the sale of its last remaining sailing vessels, including the Star of Bengal.

J.J. Smith & Co. 

San Francisco-based trading company J.J. Smith & Co. acquired the Star of Bengal in June 1898. At that time, maritime shipping out of United States Pacific ports was undergoing a major change. After the impact of the Long Depression on regional shipping peaked in 1896–1897, the demand for Pacific Coast maritime transportation unexpectedly soared. It was driven by the Nome Gold Rush, which intensified the colonization of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and created numerous opportunities for new passenger and trade routes. As a result, many old vessels were purchased to service these routes.

J.J. Smith & Co. re-registered the Star of Bengal in the United States, and in 1898, the 25-year-old ship underwent a major overhaul. To make the ship's operations more cost-effective, her mizzen-mast was re-rigged from square to fore-and-aft, and the Star of Bengal turned from a full-rigged ship to a barque. She got new decks, but the number of bulkheads in service decreased from three to one. In 1904, a donkey boiler was installed on the ship to assist the crew with raising sails.

While the Star of Bengal sailed under J.J. Smith & Co., her captain was H. Henderson. The company operated the ship on a variety of trading missions, mainly trading grain and coal. In an incident in March 1899, the ship almost caught fire when, from Newcastle to San Francisco, her load of coal overheated and became spontaneously combustible. In 1905, the J.J. Smith & Co. could no longer operate the Star of Bengal with profit and sold her to the Alaska Packers' Association.

Alaska Packers' Association 

The Alaska Packers' Association (APA) was another beneficiary of Alaskan exploration, and an active consumer of old vessels. Based in San Francisco, the company was engaged in Alaska salmon fishery; it operated salmon canneries across Alaska through a fleet of ships engaged in transporting packed salmon and fishery workers. The company purchased several iron sailing ships originally built for J.P. Corry & Co., including the Star of Bengal, and renamed all of its remaining ships by adding prefix ""Star of-"" to their names in an attempt to achieve instant name recognition. The APA became the largest company engaged in Alaskan salmon fisheries and, by 1908, the largest salmon-packing concern in the world.

Beginning in 1905, the Star of Bengal's captain was Nicholas Wagner. The company had the Star of Bengal insured by Lloyd's. In 1908, the ship was appraised between $70,000 and $75,000 ($1,900,000 and $2,000,000 in 2020 dollars). Taking advantage of ""good strong old British iron"" and ""lower insurance rates,"" APA operated the ship seasonally: in the spring, she would sail from San Francisco to Alaska, bringing seasonal workers, fuel, and other supplies to the canneries; in the fall, she would sail back loaded with canned salmon and returning workers. In the winter, the Star of Bengal was moored at Alameda, California with other ships of the ""Star fleet.""

At the time, salmon canneries required cheap, unskilled labor, and the Alaska Packers' Association primarily hired immigrants of Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino descent as seasonal workers. These workers were provided in bulk by Chinese labor contractors operating out of San Francisco. On the company ships, ""Orientals"" were segregated from white workers and crew, in part due to separate habits and diet and because they were treated as second-class citizens. The APA supplied these workers with housing, fuel, and water, while Chinese labor contractors provided them with food, whiskey, and opium.

Additional wooden structures were added to the Star of Bengal's hold to accommodate seasonal workers. In addition to the workers and supplies, the ship could carry a maximum load of 85,000  cases of salmon, an equivalent of  of cargo. In 1906, the wholesale price of one case of salmon was $5.80, so the ship's full load of salmon represented $500,000 in 1906 dollars ($13,000,000 in 2020 dollars).

Wreck

Background 

In 1908, the Star of Bengal sailed from San Francisco on April 22, arriving at Fort Wrangell on May 5. She was loaded with supplies for Wrangell cannery, including fuel for the season, and had 146 people on board, 110 of which were Asian. Because maneuvering a sailing vessel through a maze of small islands and narrow straits is too risky, the last  of the voyage, from Warren Island to Fort Wrangell, the Star of Bengal was tugged by the  250-hp Chilkat, an Alaska Packers' Association steamboat. That summer, the Wrangell cannery yielded 52,000 cases of salmon which were loaded on the ship while she was moored next to the cannery for the season.

The events of September 20, 1908

Loss of control 
The return trip began on September 19 with 137 or 138 people on board. This time, the tug Chilkat was unavailable to take the Star of Bengal into the open sea, so on company orders, she was towed by two smaller steamboats – the  90-hp Hattie Gage and the  225-hp Kayak, neither of which were designed for vessel towing or large enough to perform the operation individually. The Kayak's draft was too shallow, so when towing a vessel she risked propeller and rudder being submerged too shallowly for effective operation, especially in rough weather. The Hattie Gage's aft was not equipped with proper bitts, so  and  hawser had to be tied directly to her mast. Both tugs were owned by the Alaska Packers' Association.

The Hattie Gage was under command of Captain Erwin Ferrar, who had 35 years of experience at sea, including 13 seasons in Alaska. The Kayak was captained by Captain Patrick Hamilton, who had recently obtained his captain's license after 10 years of experience at sea as mate and boatswain. Together with Captain Wagner of the Star of Bengal, they decided to proceed with the tow, as the weather was calm. Captain Ferrar was placed in charge of the operation. The small flotilla left Fort Wrangell at 8:20 a.m., making about  and planning to reach the open sea at Warren Island in 12 to 18 hours. The vessels passed point Baker at 3:50 p.m., and reached the  strait between Coronation Island and Warren Island at 10:00 p.m. By that time, the wind has strengthened, and the visibility was poor due to rain, mist, and darkness. The lookouts on both tugs could no longer see the Star of Bengal, which was  behind them.

By midnight, the flotilla was on its final leg between Warren and Coronation islands, and the captains of both tugboats became concerned with the freshening southeast headwind. The vessels were making very little forward progress, and getting closer to Coronation Island than expected. With the poor visibility, the crews of all three ships relied on lead lines to ascertain their positions with respect to land. As the wind continued to strengthen, by 1:00 a.m. Captains Farrar and Hamilton, whose tugboats were moving  from each other, negotiated a turn to jibe the Star of Bengal, i.e., to pull her through the wind and change her tack from port to starboard.

The Star of Bengal's crew also became concerned, but could neither see nor communicate with the tugboats. At 1:45 a.m., the Hattie Gage blew a series of whistles signaling the maneuver, which were heard on the Star of Bengal. However, as the tugs started the turn, the Kayak's rudder proved ineffective in the rough weather, and she failed to turn into the wind. For some time, the tugs worked against each other, their combined effort overpowering the Star of Bengal's rudder and preventing her from making the turn to safety. Aware of the looming danger, Star of Bengal first mate begged Captain Wagner to sever the Kayak's hawser, which was dragging the ship in the wrong direction, but the captain refused, as maritime law prohibited such action on the part of the vessel in tow.

At one point, the tugs succeeded turning the Star of Bengal to a starboard tack, but she immediately reverted to port tack. Whether due to a sudden change in direction of the wind or to an error on part of the Star of Bengal's crew, her sails were filled aback. This resulted in a more dangerous situation, pushing all three vessels towards the rocky shore of Coronation island. The two tugs continued to struggle to pull the Star of Bengal out of danger, but the ships continued to drift leeward. Both tugs started to experience mechanical problems with their boilers due to overloading, and the Hattie Gage developed structural problems with her mast mounting. At 3:50 a.m. the Star of Bengal dropped her anchors in  of water. Pulled into less than  of water and occasionally as close as  to the land, the tugs finally severed their hawsers at 4:00 a.m., steamed out of danger, and found shelter from the still-strengthening winds  away, behind Warren Island.

The sinking 

With the dawn, the Star of Bengal's crew realized how dangerous the ship's position was: just  from the rocky beach of Coronation Island, barely held by her anchors amidst the storm. By 7:00 a.m., the wind turned into a gale, reaching . With no tugs in sight, the crew started preparing for the worst. All men aboard received life-preservers; however, most of the Chinese passengers did not put them on. Captain Wagner called for volunteers who would attempt to reach the shore in a lifeboat to secure a line on shore in order to evacuate passengers with a breeches buoy. The crew dumped oil into the sea to calm the waves, but the first attempt to lower a lifeboat failed, as it immediately smashed into pieces.

The second attempt to lower the boat was successful, and manned by four volunteers, the boat reached the shore and broke into pieces on the impact with the rocky beach. All four men survived the crash, and by 9:00 a.m. they managed to secure a rope from the Star of Bengal to a tree. The donkey boiler was used to keep the rope strained. However, as another volunteer was climbing along the rope with the breeches buoy, the ship's anchors finally gave in to the storm. The rope became unstable and unsuitable for evacuation, and the volunteer was catapulted  into the air and killed as he landed on the ship's deck. At 9:32 a.m., the ship struck the rocks. During the next 54 minutes, the ship's hull broke in three pieces, and she sank at  with just her mizzen topmast visible above water.

Passengers and crew found themselves in  water surrounded by wooden cases of canned salmon and empty steel fuel drums from the ship's hold. Frenzied by the storm, the debris was almost impossible to swim through. Depending on the exact number of passengers aboard the Star of Bengal, 110 or 111 people died in the wreck, and 27 people survived. The beach was soon covered by dead bodies, many mutilated by the ship's cargo, and many drowned in the powerful undertow. The 27 survivors included the four volunteers and Captain Wagner, who was pulled unconscious from the water by crew members.

The survivors used the leftovers of fuel to make fire and stay warm. They made an extensive search for survivors, buried white corpses, and left Asian corpses behind, covered by ship's sails. The survivors were picked up by the Kayak the next day. The US government cable ship Burnside arrived at the scene of the wreck later, and her crew buried the remaining corpses in a mass grave. With the high number of casualties, as of 2015, the wreck is among the top five worst marine disasters in the history of Alaska.

The investigation 
As soon as the survivors reached shore, Captain Wagner publicly accused the tugboat captains of ""criminal cowardice."" He alleged that they abandoned the Star of Bengal in a dangerous situation and ignored her distress lights, thus missing the window of opportunity before the storm intensified at 8:00 a.m. when passengers could have been taken from the Star of Bengal aboard the tugboats. Captain Ferrar denied the existence of such a window, as had there been a period of calm sea, Captain Wagner could have evacuated his men ashore. The case came under federal investigation, and two inspectors started hearings in San Francisco on October 3, 1908.

The hearing was initially aimed at assessing the responsibility of the Star of Bengal's crew. Captain Wagner and his first mate, Victor Johansen, were interrogated by the inspectors; both repeated the accusation against the captains of the tugs. During the hearing, the Alaska Packers' Association provided written testimonies of nautical experts that supported the position of the tugs' captains. On October 7, Captain Wagner and the first mate filed formal charges of cowardice against the tug captains.

Captains Farrar and Hamilton provided their written testimonies, insisting that their actions were justified, as after the Star of Bengal dropped her anchors they were powerless to assist the large ship and responsible to ensure safety of their own vessels and crews. After completing repairs, the Hattie Gage steamed to Fort Wrangell to seek assistance of a larger ship, the Burnside, while the Kayak went searching for the Star of Bengal, eventually locating the survivors. The tugs' crews were summoned to San Francisco to testify on October 23; both crews supported their captains' testimonies. The hearing of witnesses ended on October 27, and the inspectors published their findings on January 27, 1909. They exonerated the tugboat captains, stating that there was not sufficient evidence of criminal cowardice. Moreover, on April 15, the inspectors revoked Captain Wagner's license, holding him responsible for the loss of life. Captain Wagner immediately appealed the decision and it was promptly reversed by the supervising inspector as ""unsubstantiated.""

The aftermath 
The wreck of the Star of Bengal was described as ""one of the worst disasters"" of the Pacific coast maritime history. Due to the high number of casualties, as of 2015, the wreck of the Star of Bengal remains in the top 5 worst marine disasters in the history of Alaska. Both, the ship and her cargo were declared a total loss. The cost of the cargo was estimated at $227,000 ($6,000,000), bringing the total value of hull and cargo to $330,000 ($8,800,000): the largest maritime loss in Alaska waters at the time. The ship and her cargo was insured by Lloyd's, which limited the losses of the Alaska Packers' Association. The APA made volunteer donations to the families of the lost of more than $16,000 ($425,000) in total, which was considered generous at the time.

After his license was restored, Captain Wagner continued to command other sailing vessels. Captains Farrar and Hamilton were tried by the court of public opinion, and as of 2001, their role in the wreck remains uncertain. In later years, divers made numerous attempts to locate the wreckage of the Star of Bengal, but as of 2005, they were unsuccessful. In 2008, a centennial commemoration of the wreck was organized in the Wrangell Museum.

In fiction

The Cradle of the Deep 

In March 1929, Captain Wagner's daughter, Joan Lowell, published a book titled The Cradle of the Deep purported to be her autobiography. In the book, Lowell spends the first 17 years of her life aboard her father's schooner, the Minnie A. Caine, barefoot and surrounded by the all-male crew. Initially, The Cradle of the Deep received multiple positive reviews from different sources, including The Washington Post, Time, Life, and the Los Angeles Times.

The book soon became a bestseller, topping the non-fiction category of The New York Times Best Seller list. Even though it was quickly exposed as a hoax, the subsequent literary scandal and the media frenzy propelled The Cradle of the Deep into its fiction category, and The Cradle of the Deep finished 1929 as the third best-selling book of the year.

In chapter 11 of The Cradle of the Deep, Lowell gives her account of the Star of Bengal's wreck, which is loosely based on the stories she heard from her father. In the book, ominous signs foreshadow the wreck, and the full responsibility of the disaster is placed on the shoulders of the tugboat captains, who mishandle their drunken and inexperienced crews, become ""panic-stricken,"" and flee the scene. Furthermore, the tug captains commit other acts ""beyond human comprehension,"" including burning the corpses of the Chinese passengers ""like rubbish"" on Coronation Island, and salvaging the food from the Star of Bengal's hold that was mixed with the dead men and selling the cooked mixture to Eskimos.

Inspired by the scandal, humorist Corey Ford published a parody on Lowell's book titled Salt Water Taffy; or, Twenty thousand leagues away from the sea; the almost incredible autobiography of Capt. Ezra Triplett's seafaring daughter, by June Triplett, which also became a bestseller. In his book, Ford exaggerates the most grotesque details of The Cradle of the Deep, thus demonstrating the fraudulent nature of the ""autobiography."" Chapter 6 of Salt Water Taffy, which mimics chapter 11 of The Cradle of the Deep, Ford ridicules Lowell's devotion to the maritime omens that allegedly preceded the Star of Bengal's last voyage and the portrayal of her father as an infallible captain.

Broadway play  
In 1929, Joan Lowell's husband, Thompson Buchanan, wrote a play titled Star of Bengal, which is set on the ship. The play was produced by Christopher Morley and opened in late September, starring Charles Starrett, Joan Lowell, and William P. Carleton. This ""consciously superannuated"" melodrama features a love affair between the captain's daughter (Lowell) and a sailor (Starrett) that leads to their elopement. The runaways are caught, and the captain (Carleton) is about to hang the sailor; however, upon learning that his daughter is pregnant, the captain turns magnanimous. The play lasted only until November and was generally regarded as unsuccessful. Its failure was rumored to be a contributing factor in Buchanan's and Lowell's subsequent divorce.

Located at the intersection of 135th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem and Hamilton Heights in Manhattan, it is served by the B on weekdays, the C train at all times except nights, and the A train during late nights only.

History
The station opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND)'s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street.

Station layout

There is no trim line at this station, but there are mosaic name tablets reading ""135TH ST."" in white sans-serif lettering on a Prussian green background and black border. Small tile captions reading ""135"" run along the wall at regular intervals between the name tablets, and under the name tablets are directional captions, all in white lettering on a black background. Hunter green I-beam columns run along the platforms at regular intervals, alternating ones having the standard black station name plate with white lettering.

This station is the only local station with six tracks between two side platforms and is one of only three stations in the entire subway system that features six tracks on the same level, within the same tunnel (the others are DeKalb Avenue and Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets, both in Downtown Brooklyn). The two outermost tracks are used by local trains stopping at this station, while the two innermost tracks are used by express trains. The middle tracks in each direction are lay-up tracks and not used in revenue service. All fare controls are at platform level and there are no mezzanines, crossovers, or crossunders.

This station is located close to the nearby City College of New York.

Exits
The full-time booths are at the 135th Street end, at 137th Street there is a part-time exit. The booth at the 137th Street exit has been removed. There were restrooms at the 137th Street end of the southbound platform. Both street staircases at this end were built with their entry points facing St. Nicholas Park and have an old-fashioned appearance.

239,63847622,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert%20N.%20Houck,Herbert N. Houck,"Herbert Norman Houck (April 2, 1915 – February 24, 2002) was a highly decorated United States Navy pilot with the rank of captain. During World War II, he became a flying ace with six aerial victories and was awarded three Navy Crosses.

Early life and service 
Herbert N. Houck was born on April 2, 1915, in Corona, Minnesota. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Minnesota for three years. Houck went into the Navy in 1936 and was designated as a Naval Aviator.

World War II 
When the United States became involved in World War II, Houck was assigned to Fighting Squadron 9 (VF-9). On June 30, 1943, Lieutenant Houck was flying an F6F Hellcat over Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, when he was involved in a mid-air collision with another Hellcat pilot. Houck successfully bailed out while the other pilot was killed.

In September 1943, VF-9 embarked on the USS Essex and left Pearl Harbor to partake in combat operations in the Pacific Theater. On November 11, 1943, Lieutenant Commander Houck, who was now the executive officer of the squadron, led other pilots in a preliminary attack at Rabaul Harbor, New Britain, strafing Japanese shore batteries and ships while under heavy anti-aircraft fire. Later that day, he shot down three Japanese aircraft and assisted in shooting down two others which were attacking friendly ships. For his actions that day, Houck was awarded his first Navy Cross.

Operation Hailstone 
Lieutenant Commander Houck would be awarded his second Navy Cross for his actions on February 16, 1944. In the early morning hours of that date, he led his squadron in the first attack against Japanese-held Truk Atoll, Carolina Islands. VF-9 made repeated strafing attacks on parked enemy planes on the Param airfield and at the Moen seaplane base.

Houck personally accounted for six of the 27 planes destroyed despite heavy anti-aircraft fire. Additionally, his squadron shot down 21 fighter planes which were attempting to intercept them, with Houck claiming two of these planes, attaining ace status. Later on that same day, Houck led a fighter group which escorted dive bombers and torpedo bombers to Truk Atoll. Houck's fighters attracted the majority of the anti-aircraft fire by strafing enemy ships and the airfield at Eten Island prior to the bombing attack.

Battle of Okinawa 
On April 1, 1945, American troops invaded Okinawa. VF-9, now attached to the USS Yorktown, helped provide Naval air support during the operation. On April 6, the largest battleship ever built, the Yamato, left its home port at Kure, Japan, sailing towards Okinawa. The Yamato was travelling with nine other ships, however they had no air support and lacked sufficient fuel to return to mainland Japan once they reached Okinawa. The ships were essentially on a suicide mission. On April 7, the ships were spotted and attacked by several waves of American aircraft in the East China Sea off Kyushu.

Lieutenant Commander Houck led over 40 torpedo bombers towards the enemy convoy through inclement weather, during which his plane experienced a partial engine failure and he was almost forced to turn back. Upon reaching the enemy ships, Houck's squadron attacked numerous ships under heavy anti-aircraft fire. He led several planes in an attack on the Yamato, striking the battleship with several torpedoes. The Yamato capsized shortly afterwards and exploded, killing more than 2,500 crew members. Houck took several photographs with his wing camera and his squadron also sunk the cruiser Yahagi, essentially marking the end of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Houck was awarded his third and final Navy Cross for his actions.

Later career and life 
Houck stayed in the Navy after the war and served in the Korean War before he was promoted to captain in 1956. He served as the commanding officer of the USS Shangri-La from 1960 to 1961. Also serving during the Vietnam War, Captain Houck ultimately retired in 1968.

Herbert N. Houck died on February 24, 2002, in Cape Coral, Florida. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

241,53778620,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial%20Hospital%20of%20Salem%20County,Memorial Hospital of Salem County,"The Memorial Hospital of Salem County (MHSC) is a hospital in Salem County, New Jersey, United States. The hospital was founded in 1919, after which it operated as a non-profit. It was founded in downtown Salem and moved to Mannington Township in 1951. It has 126 beds, and in 2017, New Jersey approved a plan to sell it to Prime Healthcare Foundation.  The name of the hospital was change to Salem Medical Center in 2019 when it was acquired by Community Healthcare Associates.

History
In 2002, Community Health Systems acquired Memorial Hospital for $34 million. When the purchase occurred, the Salem Health and Wellness Foundation was formed, with the goal over overseeing donations and proceeds acquired by MHSC. This was because the state required the proceeds from the sale to Community Health Systems to be ""overseen by a foundation that would pay to enhance medical services in the area."" However, 12 years later, Senate President Steve Sweeney argued that the foundation was sitting on $56 million, and had ""disbursed very little to expand health care services.""

In 2010, a plan by MHSC to close its maternity ward was withdrawn after public outcry. In November 2013, the hospital's board again applied to close its maternity ward, so it could allocate resources to other areas such as surgical infrastructure. The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services approved the decision on April 1, 2014. The health department noted that the hospital had only one obstetrician at the staff, and births at the hospital had dropped from 385 in 2004 to 155 in 2012. As a condition of the closure, the hospital was still required to transport patients to other inpatient maternity services, or provide emergency stabilization to women arrive pregnant, and delivery in cases where birth is imminent. A local healthcare union spoke out against the decision, and Health Professionals and Allied Employees argued the closure would negatively affect local income-women. In the end of May 2014, the hospital closed its maternity ward.

In 2014, lawmakers in New Jersey drafted legislation to make it easier to sell Memorial Hospital to a potential non-profit purchaser.

In 2015, Community Health Systems Inc. agreed to sell the assets of Memorial Hospital of Salem County to Prime Healthcare Foundation. It also sold all related outpatient services. The hospital CEO Ryan Jensen resigned in December 2016, after joining as CEO in May 2014. The hospital had shrunk somewhat in size by then, and apart from closing its maternity ward it had decreased its beds from 140 to 126 in terms of registration. In that month, the hospital also re-elected new board members. The sale of the hospital was approved by the New Jersey State Health Planning Board in early February 2017, for $15 million. The facility had 126 beds. The board voted 7 to 0 in approval of the sale to Prime Healthcare Foundation. On the same day the state approved the sale Prime Healthcare backed out of the deal. The hospital is currently still looking for a buyer.

In 2018, Community Healthcare Associates announced plans to acquire Memorial Hospital of Salem County.  The plan was approved and CHA acquired the hospital on February 1, 2019, renaming the hospital “Salem Medical Center.”

243,26714561,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP%20delayed%20acknowledgment,TCP delayed acknowledgment,"TCP delayed acknowledgment is a technique used by some implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol in an effort to improve network performance. In essence, several ACK responses may be combined into a single response, reducing protocol overhead. However, in some circumstances, the technique can reduce application performance.

Method and advantages
As described in RFC 1122, a host may delay sending an ACK response by up to 500 ms. Additionally, with a stream of full-sized incoming segments, ACK responses should be sent for every second segment.

Delayed ACKs can give the application the opportunity to update the TCP receive window and also possibly to send an immediate response along with the ACK. For certain protocols such as Telnet, delayed ACKs can reduce the number of responses sent by the server by a factor of 3, by combining the ACK, window update and the response data into one segment.

Problems
The additional wait time introduced by the delayed ACK can cause further delays when interacting with certain applications and configurations. If Nagle's algorithm is being used by the sending party, data will be queued by the sender until an ACK is received. If the sender does not send enough data to fill the maximum segment size (for example, if it performs two small writes followed by a blocking read) then the transfer will pause up to the ACK delay timeout. Linux 2.4.4+ supports a TCP_QUICKACK socket option that disables delayed ACK.

For example, consider a situation where Bob is sending data to Carol. Bob's socket layer has less than a complete packet's worth of data remaining to send. Per Nagle's algorithm, it will not be sent until he receives an ACK for the data that has already been sent. At the same time, Carol's application layer will not send a response until it gets all of the data. If Carol is using delayed ACKs, her socket layer will not send an ACK until the timeout is reached.

If the application is transmitting data in smaller chunks and expecting periodic acknowledgment replies, this negative interaction can occur. To prevent this delay, the application layer needs to continuously send data without waiting for acknowledgment replies. Alternatively, Nagle's algorithm may be disabled by the application on the sending side.

He belonged to the noble Cypriot house of Ibelin, closely linked by intermarriage with the kings of Cyprus. His father Balian of Ibelin (d. 28 October 1333), Lord of Arsuf, was a direct descendant of the first Balian of Ibelin, an important crusader. His mother, Margaret of Ibelin, continued to hold the title Lady of Arsuf after her husband's death. In the second half of the fourteenth century the fortunes of the house of Ibelin were in decline, as the once-powerful family became extinct. Guy's brother Philip became the last Ibelin to hold the title Lord of Arsuf. He was executed in Genoa in late 1373 for taking part in the assassination of King Peter I of Cyprus in 1369; King James I of Cyprus subsequently bestowed the title on John of Neviles, viscount of Nicosia, in 1389.

Instead of receiving a prebend, the normal path for a younger son of a high aristocratic family to join the church and enjoy the comfortable life of an ecclesiastical nobleman, Guy chose to join the austere dominican order, perhaps in the same monastery in Nicosia where he was later laid to rest. Two years after his elevation to bishop in 1357, he was the presiding bishop at the coronation of Peter I in the cathedral of St Sophia, Nicosia. It appears that he took part in the campaign to capture Alexandria in 1365, before succumbing to illness in his mansion in Nicosia in 1367.

Guy bequeathed 20,000 bezants towards the construction of the cathedral of St Nicholas in Limassol. A detailed inventory of his belongings survives him; although his main residence, in addition to his three rural estates, was not furnished in an opulent manner, – Turkish carpets and cushions typical of the Latin orient replacing courtly tapestries – he still indulged in hunting, the favourite pastime of the nobility, having three falconers in his service, a modest number for the time.

249,3974732,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9bec%20solidaire,Québec solidaire,"Québec solidaire (QS; ) is a democratic socialist, social-democratic and sovereigntist political party in Quebec, Canada. The party and media outlets in Canada usually use the name ""Québec solidaire"" in both French and English, but the party's name is sometimes translated as ""Solidarity Quebec"" or ""Quebec Solidarity"" in foreign English-language media.

History

Foundation 
Québec solidaire was founded on 4 February 2006 in Montreal by the merger of the left-wing party Union des forces progressistes (UFP) and the alter-globalization political movement Option Citoyenne, led by Françoise David. It was formed by a number of activists and politicians who had written , a left-wing response to Pour un Québec lucide. Pour un Québec lucide presented a distinctly neoliberal analysis of and set of solutions to Quebec's problems, particularly criticizing the sovereignty movement as distracting from Quebec's real issues and the Quebec social model as inefficient and out-of-date. Pour un Québec solidaire presented an alternate analysis, and later its writers formed the party Quebec solidaire, taking its name from the manifesto.

Françoise David and Amir Khadir were named as the two spokespersons at the party's founding.

Electoral activity 

Québec solidaire's first political venture was to field a candidate, Manon Massé, in an 10 April 2006 by-election in Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques. She received 22% of the vote. Six years later, she became QS' third MNA.

Québec solidaire contested the 2007 Quebec election.  It won 3.65% of the popular vote and received 144,418 votes, 0.21% behind the Green Party of Quebec. They were also endorsed by the Montreal Central Council of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux which represents 125,000 members in Quebec. According to an analysis on Canadian Dimension, this was the first time a trade union in Quebec has endorsed a party more left-wing than the Parti Québécois.

On 8 December 2008, the first Quebec solidaire candidate was elected in the provincial election. Amir Khadir was elected in the Montreal riding of Mercier. He won his seat for the second term in the 2012 election along with another QS candidate Françoise David in the Montreal riding of Gouin. Subsequently, Khadir stepped down as co-spokesperson in accordance with QS party rules that stipulate one spokesperson must be from outside the legislature. André Frappier served as interim co-spokesperson until Andrés Fontecilla was chosen on 5 May 2013 to permanently fill the role. David and Frontecilla lead the party into the 2014 election where Manon Massé was elected in Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques, becoming the party's third MNA, joining David and Khadir who were both re-elected.

On 19 January 2017, Françoise David announced her immediate retirement as both party spokesperson and as a Member of the National Assembly due to her health. Massé was named the interim spokesperson, and later announced she would be a candidate for the position on a permanent basis. In March, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, one of the leaders of the 2012 Quebec student protests, joined the party as its candidate for the Gouin by-election and a candidate for party co-spokesperson. On 21 May 2017, at the party's annual convention, Massé and Nadeau-Dubois were elected as the party's spokespeople.

At the 2017 party convention, the party voted against co-operation with the Parti Québécois, and agreed to begin talks with the centre-left sovereignist Option nationale party. On 2 December 2017, QS party members approved the merger. On 10 December, ON members approved the merger, which gave them ""collective"" status within Québec solidaire.

In the 2018 election the party gained 7 more seats, bringing them to a total of 10, tying the Parti Québécois in seats.

On 22 November 2018, Québec solidaire, along with Parti Québécois, were granted official party status in the legislature. On 20 March 2019, the QS was officially recognized as the second opposition party, behind the Liberals and ahead of the Parti Québécois, after a PQ MNA left the party.

Ideology 
The aim of QS's foundation was to unify the sovereigntist political left of the political spectrum in Quebec by merging the Union des forces progressistes (UFP) party with the Option citoyenne social movement. In addition to advocating the independence of Quebec from Canada, the party's platform identifies with the concepts of environmentalism, feminism, social justice, proportional representation and participatory democracy, pacifism, aboriginal rights, and alter-globalism. The party also favours immigration, human dignity, and opposes discrimination including racism, sexism, and homophobia.  QS describes itself as a sovereigntist, green, alter-globalizationist, and feminist party. It is the left-most of the five parties presently represented in the National Assembly.

At the party's founding, the congress unanimously adopted a document called the Déclaration de principes (declaration of principles) which laid out the principles and values that led the two organizations to merge. The declaration of principles does not specifically endorse social democracy, socialism, or communism, although it includes certain activists and tendencies that do. The document declared:
 ""Nous sommes écologistes"" (""We are environmentalists"")
 ""Nous sommes de gauche"" (""We are on the Left"")
 ""Nous sommes démocrates"" (""We are democrats"")
 ""Nous sommes féministes"" (""We are feminists"")
 ""Nous sommes altermondialistes"" (""We are alter-globalists"")
 ""Nous sommes d'un Québec pluriel"" (""We are from a plural Quebec"")
 ""Nous sommes d'un Québec souverain et solidaire"" (""We are from a sovereign and united Quebec"")
 ""Un autre parti, pour un autre Québec!"" (""Another party, for another Quebec!"")

Structure 

As with its predecessors, Québec solidaire has no ""party leader"". Instead, the party practices collective leadership. The party's statutes call for it to be represented by a male and female co-spokesperson, one of whom serves in the dual role of party president.  If one of the spokespeople is a member of the National Assembly, the other spokesperson remains outside of the legislature and holds the party presidency. They are sometimes referred to in the media as the de facto co-leaders of the party.

The duties generally entrusted to the leader in most other Canadian federal and provincial parties are instead divided among the president, secretary general and male and female spokespeople. The party leadership is assumed by the National Coordinating Committee, composed of 16 persons elected by the founding congress. A person from the team of volunteers will always have a seat. However, as Quebec's election laws requires the appointment of a leader, the party's secretary general, currently Gaétan Châteauneuf, is the de jure party leader recognized by the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec.

Françoise David and Amir Khadir were the two spokespersons at the party's founding. After the 2012 election where Françoise David won a seat for the first time and Amir Khadir was re-elected, Khadir stepped down as co-spokesperson so a new one could be chosen from outside the legislature. André Frappier served as interim co-spokesperson until Andrés Fontecilla was chosen on 5 May 2013 to permanently fill the role. Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois and Manon Massé became the current co-spokespersons of the party on 21 May 2017. Alexa Conradi was president from the foundation of the party until June 2009 after which Françoise David was named president-spokeswoman.

The national spokespersons of Québec solidaire have greater visibility than the secretary general and are best known. David has been named Personality of the Year by Le Point and Khadir is known for becoming the first elected member of the party, winning the provincial riding of Mercier in 2008.

The basic unit of the party is the local association. There is a local association for each of the 125 ridings in Quebec. These local associations are grouped into 19 regional associations, whose primary mandate to support the establishment of local associations. In March 2007, Québec solidaire has 61 local associations organized. Students and staff at institutions of higher education are grouped in campus associations that also participate in the democratic life of the party. Two national commissions are also part of the structure of Québec solidaire: the Political Committee and the National Commission for Women. The first is composed of 14 thematic committees and is responsible for proposing a program to members. It was responsible for drafting the electoral platform of the party in general elections of 2007. The National Commission for Women is composed of delegates from each region and is responsible for ensuring that feminism is a value which transverses the party.

Québec solidaire also includes a number of collectives, made up of members in good standing who may, in compliance with requirements, promote their respective political views within Québec solidaire. Unlike such groups did in the UFP, these groups do not have formal representation in Québec solidaire's Congress, National Council, or other party bodies. Current collectives include:

 Alternative socialiste, the Quebec section of International Socialist Alternative.
 Décroissance conviviale, a collective which promotes degrowth.
 Gauche Socialiste, the Quebec section of the reunified Fourth International.
 Laïcité, a collective which promotes the separation of church and state.
 Mass critique, an anti-capitalist collective.
 Socialisme Internationale, the Quebec membership of the International Socialists.
 Tendance Marxiste Internationale, the Quebec section of the International Marxist Tendency.
 Option nationale,  formerly active as a separate electoral party from 2011 to 2017.

The Parti Communiste du Québec – Parti Communiste du Canada (PCQ-PCC) left QS following Québec solidaire's merger with Option nationale in 2017.

254,28676812,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahco,Bahco,"Bahco is a Swedish brand within the hand tool industry, which is now part of SNA Europe, part of Snap-on. Its roots go back to the industrial revolution in Sweden in the late eighteen hundreds, starting with innovations such as the pipe wrench and the modern adjustable wrench. Since then, the product range has expanded with a total assortment of products that today includes over 7000 hand tools.

History

The early years (1880s – 1950s) 
The story of Bahco began in 1886 when the Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson (1853–1943) established his company Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad in Enköping, Sweden. Johan Petter, also known as JP, was an inventor and industrialist. He invented the modern plumber wrench (1888) and adjustable wrench (patents in 1891 and 1892).

In 1890 the company's sales and marketing rights for its products were acquired by the businessman Berndt August Hjorth (1862–1937), founder of BA Hjorth & Co.

In 1916 Johan Petter Johansson sold all his stocks in Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad to Berndt August Hjorth and the company was converted to an affiliate under the new corporation AB BA Hjorth & Co.  However, it was not until 1954 that the company changed its name to AB Bahco (an acronym of the original name BA Hjorth & Co).

Over the following years, Bahco underwent many changes and acquisitions, established its presence abroad and was introduced on the Swedish stock market.

Era of changes (1960s – 1980s) 
During the 1960s and 1970s AB Bahco consisted of four major companies: Bahco Ventilation, Mecamen, Bahco Tools and Bahco Sudamericana. Bahco Ventilation was responsible for products and facilities for air purification, energy and recycling, Mecamen had all the pneumatics, hydraulics and control systems and Bahco Tools controlled the production of hand tools, air tools and hydraulic tools.   Bahco Sudamericana was the largest of Bahco's foreign subsidiaries producing hand tools in a factory located in Santa Fe, Argentina.

1991 Bahco Tools was acquired by the industrial corporation Sandvik AB and was renamed Sandvik Bahco. The original factory Bahco Tools in Enköping, Sweden, then became a separate production center within Sandvik's business area Saws & Tools.   During this time, major investments were made to increase productivity and to reduce lead times in the production. In addition, a new distribution concept was introduced to improve delivery and availability.

Up to the present (1990s – 2010s) 
In the mid-1990s Snap-on Incorporated, a global manufacturer and distributor of tools, entered the European market by acquiring the Spanish hand tool company Herramientas Eurotools S.A. In 1999, Snap-on acquired the business area Saws & Tools from Sandvik. The acquired business was named Bahco Group AB, a company with 2500 employees.

In 2005 Bahco AB and Herramientas Eurotools S.A. merged, founding SNA Europe with Bahco as the company's premium brand. Its headquarters was established in metropolitan Paris, France.

Products 
The total assortment of products Bahco offer includes more than 7000 items of professional hand tools like metal cutting saws, files and rotary burrs, wrenches and spanners, sockets and accessories, torque tools, impact tools and bits, screwdrivers, pliers, automotive special tools, electronics and fine mechanical pliers, extractors, refrigeration tools, tool storage, woodworking tools, pruning tools, and forestry hand tools.

Innovations and patents 
 1888: JP invented and took patent for the pipe wrench
 1891: JP's first patent registered on the adjustable wrench
 1969: Introduced the Bi-metal hacksaw blade Sandflex
 1982: Introduced the world's first ergonomic screwdriver
 1996: Introduced and took the patent for Superior handsaws

Bahco - the brand

The “fish & hook” logo 

In 1862 Swedish Göran Fredrik Göransson founded Högbo Stål & Jernwerks AB, producing high-quality steel using the Bessemer process. In 1866 company went into bankruptcy and was refounded as Sandviken Jernverks AB in 1868. With the new technology a number of new applications for steel wires were discovered, for instance, it was perfect for producing fishing hooks. A fishing hook must be hard and strong but absolutely not brittle. In 1879 The Swedish national board of trade approved the use of the Fish and Hook trademark. Starting in 1886, Göran began the production of saw blades that were of that same high-quality steel. The little fish surrounded by a hook that was registered as the official emblem of rolled steel for fishhooks was also used for the handsaws, to communicate these special properties and quality of the blades. Today all Bahco tools are branded with this logo.

ERGO 

In 1983 Bahco started to develop and manufacture ergonomic hand tools. The first products that were developed according to ergonomic principles were the screwdrivers (1983), the adjustable wrenches (1984), wood chisels (1985) and slip-joint pliers (1986). 
In 1996, the Bahco Ergo concept was presented and scientifically approved as a way of preventing repetitive strain injuries and to increase productivity. All Bahco tools that carry the Ergo trademark have undergone a scientific 11-point development program with regard to ergonomics and function.

She was a daughter and fiftieth child of Siamese King Mongkut (Rama IV) and Princess Consort Piam. She was the half-sister and first wife of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) of Siam (now Thailand). The kings's other two wives were her younger sisters, Queen Savang Vadhana and Queen Saovabha Bhongsi.

The queen and her daughter Kannabhorn Bejaratana drowned when the steam boat Marawan collided with their royal boat towed by the steam yacht Pan Marut on the way to the Bang Pa-In Royal Palace (Summer Palace).

There is an often repeated myth that the many witnesses to the accident did not dare to touch the queen, a capital offense—not even to save her life. However, this was not the case; the King's diary records that boatmen dived into the water, pulled the queen and her daughter from the entangling curtains, and carried them to another boat, where attendants worked in vain to resuscitate them. No one else died in the accident.

Funeral 
The grief-stricken Chulalongkorn demanded a resplendent funeral for them. Preparations for the funeral took 10 months and the funeral ceremony did not begin until March 10, 1881. The bodies of the queen and princess were dried with injections of quicksilver and stored in golden urns while precious woods were collected for the construction of a funeral pyre; royal facilities where the king and entourage resided during the cremation ceremonies were also constructed in a location referred to as Pra Mane. The funeral pyre was reported to be  tall and was built over an altar where the urns were placed for cremation.

The proceedings and celebrations were opulent, attended by many, and documented in great detail. Chulalongkorn lit the funeral pyre around 6PM on March 15 to the sound of horns, and the pyre burned throughout the night. Celebrations ended on March 20 with a procession to the Grand Palace.

260,33759756,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campell%20Castle,Campell Castle,"Campell or Campi Castle is a castle in the municipality of Sils im Domleschg of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland.  It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.

History

The castle was probably begun in the early 13th century for the knightly von Campell family.  The first mention of the family is from 1289 when Egeno de Campelle appears in a record.  The original castle was a four story bergfried.(Bauphase 1 on drawing)  In the 13th or early 14th century it was expanded with a ring wall, gatehouse, ditches and a drawbridge on the west side and a residential wing on the east.(Bauphase 2)  However, the Campell family died out in the 14th century.  In 1389 the Bishopric of Chur recorded that Bishop Hartmann granted lands that used to be the Campell fief to Hans and Gottfried von Ehrenfels.  Though the grant probably did not include the castle, because it wasn't until 1418 that the Bishop granted the castle to Hermann von Schauenstein-Ehrenfels.

During the 15th century, the west wall was raised and had a roof added.  The original tower had two more stories added and was topped with crenelations.  A large cistern was excavated to the north.(Bauphase 3)  Around the middle of the 15th century the castle was given to the Ringg family, but in 1500 it was returned to the Schauenstein family, so it is unclear who renovated the castle.

In the 16th century it was once again rebuilt.  The west wall and zwinger were roofed over and became a three story palas.  The old gate in the west was walled up and a new one was added in the south wall.  The west wall was extended northward to protect the castle's flank.(Bauphase 4)

In 1562 the Schauenberg-Ehrenfels sold the castle to Hans Faschau.  A few years later, in 1567, he sold it to Hercules von Salis, whose family held the castle for almost a century.  During the Bündner Wirren of the Thirty Years' War the castle was damaged by fire.  The west palas was rebuilt in 1635, while the east residential wing was abandoned and became a stable.(Bauphase 5)  In 1647 the Salis family sold it to the Freiherr von Schauenstein-Fürstenau.  By 1700 it was abandoned, but remained in good condition.  By 1900, it had fallen into ruin when the Abula line of the Rhaetian Railway was built over the outer moat.  In 1932 the Campell family bought the castle.  It remained with this family until 1987 when they donated it to the Campell/Campi Ruin Foundation (Stiftung Ruine Campell/Campi).  Between 1993 and 1998 the ruins were stabilized, repaired and excavated and they opened to visitors in 2001.

Castle site

Much of the castle is still standing.  The original tower stands in the center of the complex.  At the foot of the tower is an arched doorway that leads to the eastern wing of the castle.  Both the tower and the east wing have retained their medieval character.  The west palas was built after the castle had ceased being a fortification and had become a nobleman's house and so has large windows which would have lit comfortable rooms.

Barton was born in Chorlton, Lancashire in April 1917. He joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and was elected chairman of the Stretford Trades Council.  By 1944, he was the chairman of the Manchester Federation of the ILP, and was the party's second choice to contest the Manchester Rusholme by-election after Fenner Brockway, but neither accepted the opportunity, and Robert Edwards stood instead.

At the 1950 general election, Barton stood for the party in Newcastle upon Tyne.  He then stood for the party at the 1951 Ormskirk by-election.

Barton was elected as chairman of the ILP in March 1951.  While chairman, he campaigned against apartheid in South Africa and the Korean War.

In April 1954, Barton was succeeded as chairman by Annie Maxton.  Later in the year, he resigned from the ILP and joined the Labour Party.  At the 1955 general election, he was the unsuccessful Labour candidate in Stretford, taking 39.1% of the vote, and in 1959, he took 40.4% in Middleton and Prestwich.  He became the Liverpool district organiser of the Tobacco Workers' Union.  In the run-up to the 1964 general election, he was the Labour Party Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Liverpool Kirkdale, but he died suddenly in December 1963 from thrombosis.

265,54737911,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moggridgea%20rainbowi,Moggridgea rainbowi,"Moggridgea rainbowi, also called the Australian trapdoor spider, is a small spider endemic to Kangaroo Island in South Australia. The spider was first recorded in 1919.

Distribution
The spider's habitat is in burrows just above the high tide mark. The spider has been identified and studied from two sites on Kangaroo Island; the genomes from the two sites 80 km apart indicate that the groups diverged 1 to 6 million years ago, reflective of juveniles not migrating far from their maternal sites.  The most closely related species is considered to be the African M. intermedia.

A study has indicated that M. rainbowi is likely to have reached Australia from Africa between 2 and 16 million years ago. Given that this time is intermediate between the separation of Australia from Gwondwana (circa 95 million years ago) and the arrival of humans into Australia, it has been proposed that the spiders may have arrived by oceanic dispersal, such as by rafting vegetation.

Behaviour
The spiders live in short burrows, approximately 6cm deep. Young spiders live with their mothers before building their own burrows nearby.

2019-2020 bushfires
All known Western River populations were destroyed during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, one of which burned a third of Kangaroo Island. Only 5 survivors have since been reported.

History
The building was designed by W H Mitchell as the headquarters of the 1st Hampshire Artillery Volunteers and completed in 1889. It was an initiative of Colonel Edward Bance, former Mayor of Southampton, and was opened by Edward Stanhope, Secretary of State for War, in 1890. With the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the 1st Hampshire AV became the Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery, but the drill hall also became the home of the Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery in 1908. Both units were mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914, with the Hampshire RGA manning coast forts and the Hampshire RHA being deployed to the Middle East.

After World War I, the Hampshire RGA resumed its coast defence role while the Hampshire RHA amalgamated with the Hampshire Yeomanry and evolved to become 378 (Hampshire RHA) Battery with its base in Southampton. It was renamed 218 (Hampshire RHA) Battery in 1937 and served as part of 72nd (Hampshire) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, during World War II. The heavy regiment formed three coast artillery regiments during the war that manned the Portsmouth and Southampton defences. 

Postwar, the drill hall was decommissioned and converted for leisure use in 1974.

272,37324674,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Houstonian%20Hotel,The Houstonian Hotel,"The Houstonian Hotel, Club & Spa is a luxury hotel located in Houston, Texas. The 18-acre campus includes a hotel and conference center, several restaurants, spa and health and fitness center.

History
The developer of the Houstonian Hotel was Tom Fatjo, a Houstonian who had also founded Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI). The hotel opened in 1980. George Alexander of the Houston Press said that the hotel was ""built as a health club for business executives trying to shed pounds and rediscover their inner velociraptor"".

George H. W. Bush residence
George H. W. Bush used the hotel as his official voting residence in the 1980s. After, signing an affidavit in April 1985, promising to build his retirement house in Houston, Vice President of the United States George H. W. Bush was permitted to use Texas as his official voting residence. Bush's official voting address was Suite 271, a three bedroom suite in The Houstonian. Bush's wife, Barbara, also used The Houstonian as her official voting address. The Bushes had moved out of Houston in 1981. Alexander said that, therefore The Houstonian became better known for being the designated residence of Bush than for its original purpose.

Bush spent most of his time away from Washington, DC in Kennebunkport, Maine. By making Texas the family official residence, Bush did not have to pay Maine income taxes. The Maine People's Alliance, a group advocating for fairness in taxation, said that by declaring Texas as his residence, he did not pay about $244,000 ( dollars) in income taxes. Money had reported that Bush was paying less than 1% of his gross income in taxes while most Americans paid around 10%.

Chapter 11 bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy
In February 1992 Houstonian Properties Ltd., the owner of the hotel, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Two Houston-based hotel companies, Redstone Management and Wedge Hotels Corp., placed bids to buy The Houstonian. In December 1992 Redstone Hotel Inc. had completed its purchase of The Houstonian. Redstone paid $33.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

In 2003 the company Wayport Inc. of Austin, Texas installed new wired internet and high speed wireless internet services at the Houstonian. The firm scheduled completion for the end of February of that year.

As of 2001 George H. W. Bush frequently patronized the hotel astroturf jogging trail and bar. As of 2004 George H. W. Bush was a member of the hotel's health club. He received his haircuts at the hotel spa.

In 2008 the hotel completed a refurbishing of the guest rooms which added energy efficient features. The hotel spent $7.1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in the refurbishing campaign, which was overseen by Kirksey architecture. The planning for the makeover took 18 months, and the makeover itself took four months to complete. Katherine Feser of the Houston Chronicle said that it resulted in ""Warm hues, rich fabrics and wood furniture set a residential tone"".

In 2010 TripAdvisor.com ranked the hotel #9 on its list of top 25 hotels in the United States. The Houstonian was one of two Texas hotels on the list.

Campus

Location
The facility is located on a  plot of land located on North Post Oak Boulevard, in proximity to Woodway and along the 610 Loop West Loop.

Tim McDonald of Travel Golf, a website of the Golf Channel, said that the location, being in proximity to Uptown and Downtown meant that the hotel became a popular place for small and large meetings. McDonald added that many celebrities and ""most of Houston's elite"" have visited the hotel because it is ""hidden away in one of the more exclusive areas of the city."" Mark Lupton, the director of sales, said ""It's like a Who's Who of Houston""

Hotel facilities
Tim McDonald of Travel Golf, of the Golf Channel, said ""The Houstonian Hotel looks like something a big-spending, Texas oil baron might have built in the old days"". The property includes a 294-room hotel, a spa named Trellis, a restaurant, a  private health and fitness center club, and a conference center. The hotel property features a lobby that has a hand-carved stone fireplace that is  tall. The hotel had  of meeting space. In 2004 the hotel had 288 guest rooms; McDonald said that most hotels of a similar size had about half of the meeting space.

McDonald said ""You might think the lack of a golf course on the premises would detract from its allure for meeting planners, but its nationally known health club makes up the difference.""

As of 2001 the restaurant, which featured fine dining, had the name Olivette. As of 2004 the restaurant had the name Manor House.

The Houstonian also featured a bar, named ""The Bar.""

Aquatics center
In 2005 the hotel opened an aquatics center, built for $3 million. Watts Pool Company provided construction services and Camden served as the general contractor. The center includes a competition sports pool, a resort pool, a garden pool, an outdoor shower, and four new toilet facilities. The competition sports pool is  by  and is  deep. It includes digital clocks, removable starting blocks, and a deck-level waterline that prevents the formation of waves. The resort pool has a sunning shelf, a ""little lagoon"" baby pool, various interactive waterfalls, and a  slide built into a rock-scape. The garden pool includes a lap swim lane, has warmer water, and has Texas-style landscaping.

Meeting services
The hotel is designed to accommodate meetings, which as of 2004 generate half of the hotel's business. Mark Lupton, the director of sales, said in 2004 that ""The Houstonian is a little different than normal places. We're kind of like halfway between a luxury hotel and a full-fledged conference center.""

As of 2004 the hotel's day meeting packages are $89 (about $ in today's money) per day per person. This rate includes meals, meeting spaces, and other amenities. The hotel includes genuine windows in meeting rooms, padded conference chairs, and other small luxury details. Hotel officials stated that the small details differentiate the hotel as a meeting space from other hotels. Lupton said ""I can tell you that makes all the difference in the world. You can look outside and see all the greenery, versus staring at the wallpaper or the freeway. We call it an urban resort in its own little oasis. You pull out of here and a quarter mile, you're back among all the tall buildings.""

275,8414685,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Overstreet,David Overstreet,"David Arthur Overstreet (September 20, 1958 – June 24, 1984) was a running back in the Canadian Football League and National Football League. He played for coach Barry Switzer and the Oklahoma Sooners as a halfback out of the wishbone offense.

Biography
A native of Big Sandy, Texas, David Overstreet prepped at Big Sandy High School and played his college football at the University of Oklahoma.

One of Overstreet's great moments as a Sooner happened on October 4, 1980 when the senior halfback ran for 258 yards on 18 carries against the Colorado Buffaloes as Oklahoma won big, 82-42.  He had long runs of 84 and 53 yards in the contest.

For Overstreet's senior season, the 5-11, 180-pound running back led the University of Oklahoma to a 10-2 record, a No. 3 ranking nationally, and the Big Eight Conference Championship while rushing for a team-leading 678 yards on 96 carries with six touchdowns.

He was drafted in the 1981 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins in the first round, 13th pick overall. A contract dispute with the Dolphins led him to sign with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League, who, under the ownership of Nelson Skalbania, tried to buy a big money winning team.

His first season (1981) was successful, as he rushed for 952 yards and was the Alouettes rookie of the year. His second season, with the newly renamed and dreadful Montreal Concordes, was plagued by injury, and he only gained 190 yards rushing.

He returned to the Dolphins in 1983, and showed much promise, rushing for 392 yards in 14 games with a 4.6 yards per carry average.

Overstreet was killed in a car accident in June 1984. He was driving northbound in his 1980 Mercedes on Texas State Highway 155, when his car swerved off the road about 10 miles northeast of Tyler into gasoline pumps at a service station and exploded. The Dolphins wore a helmet decal with the number 20 in his memory during their 1984 season in which they reached Super Bowl XIX.

He was survived by his wife, Johnnie, and son, David Overstreet II, who played safety at the University of Missouri from 2003 to 2006, and grand-nephew Jalen Overstreet.

Bibliography

Ahlam al-Shabab “Dreams of Youths”
This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form. This book is about the desires and aspirations of young people and portrays the memories of a Muslim girl.

Part of the novel: My Name is Maram, I'm in my 20s, a medical student... I've been in college for two years, a lot of things has changed in my life, have you grown up? Maybe! But I'm sure that intellectual maturity doesn't have much to do with age... Maybe there have been some changes in my life that make me feel the difference. Yes, the environment has changed, friends and acquaintances have changed, I have lost some of my friends and made new friends... Life does not stop and goes on... But that's not all because I'm writing my own memories! Every part of life is important and has a particular value to me, because I see that every individual is inherently distinct, because Almighty God created him or her different from other people, so every individual is exceptional and can only exist once, and this experience is unique... It seems we got into philosophical talk and got away from topic. Let's go back to the subject... Hmmm, what made me write my memoir? Yes...

This book was published in Arabic in 320 pages in 2006.

Fi Qalbi Ontha Ebrya “In My Heart A Jewish Girl”

Jacob accepts Rima's care and Rima, a teenage girl, grows up and starts wearing Islamic veil. Jacob's wife, Tanya, who cannot tolerates with Rima's veil and finds that her Jewish children are also interested in Islamic veil because of Rima, sees Rima as a threat to her children and asks Jacob to choose between Rima and her family. As a result, Jacob sends Rima to his sister Rachel's home in Lebanon. There, Rachel's husband mistreated Rima then she forced to move. Afterwards, she becomes acquainted with Nada and becomes one of the agents of his conversion to Islam. A love story about coexistence between religions.

This book was published in Arabic in 388 pages in 2012.

Ghorbat Al Yasmeen “The Expatriation of Jasmine”
This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form. The novel discusses about how could be difficult for Arab and Muslim refugees to adapt themselves with French society. The main character in this novel is a Muslim girl who wears a head scarf and faces problems because of it in society.

This book was published in Arabic in 407 pages in 2015.

Excerpt from the book: When she was asked first time about the journey ahead, her mother, Fatima, responded indirectly to her by these statements. She told her about Yasmeen's flower, which her name comes from it. She said Yasmeen's flower is always convinced to the least. This plant does not need much care. A single drop of fertilizer per each spring is enough for it. Suffice it to be slightly moist, then no irrigation is needed. All types of jasmine flowers prefer to grow in a sunny place but also tolerate the presence of shade. The Tunisian sun is suitable for blossoming and completing personality of this flower, but it has the ability to withstand the shade and cold climate of Europe. Like the Mediterranean white jasmine, which is very delicate in appearance but strong in character. Yasmeen's unique fragrance conveys a sense of sincerity that other roses lack.
She did not ask about the importance of the emotions that this flower brings. She knew that giving a woman a jasmine flower sometimes meant, ""Why didn't you ever love me?"" Just as her father had given her, Yasmeen, to her mother. It was her father's last gift to her mother because he had been evading custody of Yasmeen after divorce. After that, her mother never accepted anyone's love because she had dedicated herself to love for Yasmeen.She increasingly felt the absence of his mother more day after day. Over time, she became more confident that she would be lost without him. She knew that being a foreigner was not an easy experience. However, he had agreed to take the trip. Her mother had taught him how to be a real jasmine, but she may have overlooked the bitter truth: When it leaves its soil, Jasmine quickly fades away and wraps itself beautifully in the dry.

An Tabqa “To Stay”
This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form. The novel discusses about the hardships of immigration of Muslims and whether it is worth it.

This book was published in Arabic in 383 pages in 2016.

Part of the text of the book: Everything was cool and exciting until I decided to make a change in my desperate path and do something extraordinary to get me out of this absurdity hell. After that, in one of the autumn night, when I stepped on the boat that had stopped on the shore, the moonlight has faded from my life, and my life became a improvisations series of exceptional cases. From then on, I went through different adventures and endangered my life many times. I became close to the borders of death by drowning and deprived myself of justice, I even almost fell into the realm of the dead. Over and over, I found myself hoping to return to a monotonous life with no excitement. I was scared to be forgotten in a corner and die alone. I was afraid that I had ruined my normal life for nothing!

Ayn Al Mafar “Where to Escape!”
This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form. The novel mainly scrutinizes the Tunisian revolution and the effects that these failed revolutions have on the people.

This is part of the text: If she could paint a simple picture of her life, of course if she had been so aware, she recognized that it was all just suffering. Each suffering depicts a different path, expressing certain meanings that she was unaware of it... Every suffering had to search for the next suffering to find its way... In the meantime she was looking for a way to get rid of it and always asked: Which event, like a tornado, shook the pillars of her monotonous life?... Just when there was an incentive to keep going, everything seemed void to her... Like a fisherman who fished a fish then thrown it into the sea and wait for a bigger fish...

This book has been published in Arabic in 431 pages in 2018.

281,4620379,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic%20Chiu,Frederic Chiu,"Frederic Chiu (born 20 October 1964) is an American classical concert pianist.

Education
Chiu was born in Ithaca, New York.  He studied music seriously with William Eltzroth at Butler University in Indianapolis, IN, with Karen Shaw (and also studied computer science) at Indiana University, then pursued his musical studies in New York at the Juilliard School, where he studied with Abbey Simon. He also studied with Aube Tzerko, Marvin Wolfthal and Marian Rybicki. During his formative years, he won numerous piano competitions, including the Kosciuszko Foundation Chopin Piano Competition and the Music Teachers National Association Competition, both in 1984. He was awarded the American Pianists Association Fellowship (formerly known as the Beethoven Foundation) in 1985. He was given the Petschek Award by the Juilliard School in 1994, which led to a recital in Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center. He was also awarded the Avery Fisher Career Grant in 1996.

Career
After his studies, Chiu moved to France, where he lived for 12 years. His career developed without entering the circuit of international piano competitions. His recording career began in 1991 with Harmonia Mundi USA, with the well-received release of a program of piano transcriptions. He followed that with a large project of recording the complete solo piano works of Sergei Prokofiev. His recorded repertoire includes Mendelssohn, Rossini, Chopin, Liszt, Grieg, Brahms, Ravel, Decaux, Schoenberg, Schubert, Prokofiev and Saint-Saëns. 
He recorded the Liszt transcription for solo piano of the Beethoven Symphony #5. In 2015, he released the first Classical piano recording on the Yamaha Entertainment Group label, Distant Voices: piano music of Claude Debussy & Gao Ping. In 2016 he released an album called ""Hymns and Dervishes"" which comprises a selection of Middle-eastern inspired works and Western inspired works by Gurdjieff/de Hartmann. It was released by Centaur Records. In 2019, Centaur also released a chamber music recording, with the violinist William Harvey, including the Schubert Fantasie in C for Piano and Violin. Later in 2019, Centaur will release a recording of two Beethoven Symphonies (V and VII) transcribed by Franz Liszt, produced by 3-time Grammy Producer of the Year Judith Sherman.

In 1993, he entered the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, where his exclusion from the final round created enormous media coverage. He was invited increasingly to play in the United States, where he eventually returned to live.

Highlights of his performances include concerts with the BBC Concert Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Indianapolis Symphony, the Kansas City Symphony, the Dayton Philharmonic, the Hartford Symphony, the Orchestre de Bretagne of France, the China National Symphony, and the Taipei National Symphony. He has played recitals in many major cities in Europe, Asia, Northern Africa, South America and North America. In chamber music, he frequently performs with long-time friend Joshua Bell. Other artists he has collaborated with include the St. Lawrence Quartet, the Shanghai Quartet, the Daedalus Quartet, cellist Gary Hoffman, violinist Pierre Amoyal and clarinetist David Krakauer.

Chiu has given master classes at major universities and music schools around the world, including the Juilliard School, New England Conservatory, Banff and the Jacob School of Music at Indiana University. He teaches ""surgical pedaling""—precise and interactive use of the una corda, sostenuto and sustain pedals that enhance the piano's coloristic possibilities beyond what traditional pedal usage provides. Surgical pedaling can focus or diffuse overtones, highlight melodic lines independent of dynamic level, and create an unusual range of tiered coloristic effects.

Frederic Chiu also created a series of workshops entitled ""Deeper Performance Studies"" (originally named Deeper Piano Studies) that approaches piano playing through non-traditional methods uniting different philosophies of music, performance and learning.

In 2000, Chiu was on the jury for the Outstanding Amateur Competition in Fort Worth, TX. He has also served on the jury for the Utrecht Liszt Competition, the E-Competition, the American Pianist Association and the World Piano Competition in Cincinnati.

Chiu is also co-director of Beechwood Arts, a non-profit corporation that seeks to change the way the arts are created and experienced, through a program of intimate, innovative and immersive events. These include Arts Immersion Salons that include Music, Art, Performance, Film and Culinary Arts in one event around a common theme, and Culinary+Art which combines high-end restaurant experiences with gallery-quality exhibits.

Chiu is a Yamaha Artist. In 2014, he marked his 25th anniversary as a Yamaha Artist with special commemorative events, including concerts at the Newport Music Festival and in New York City at Miller Theatre.
He has been a notable supporter of Yamaha's new products, including the CFX line of grand pianos, the Disklavier Mark IV, DisklavierTV, the PSR-OR700 Keyboard, the GranTouch, the AvantGrand and Yamaha Entertainment Group's recording label. He was the first Classical artist to record for YEG, in 2015, with the release of Distant Voices, available on three platforms: Audio CD, Video DVD and DisklavierTV.

282,17369002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingeborg%20Magnusdotter%20of%20Sweden,Ingeborg Magnusdotter of Sweden,"Ingeborg Magnusdotter of Sweden (born 1277, Sweden – d. 5 April or 15 August 1319) was Queen of Denmark by marriage to King Eric VI. She was the daughter of King Magnus III of Sweden and Helwig of Holstein.

Life

Ingeborg was born a daughter of King Magnus III of Sweden and Helwig of Holstein.

In 1288, she was engaged to marry to King Eric Menved of Denmark, a marriage which took place in Helsingborg in 1296.   The marriage was as a part of dynastic policies: in 1298, her brother king Birger of Sweden married her husband's sister, Princess Martha of Denmark. The dispensation necessary for the marriage was not obtained until 1297 because of the conflict between her spouse and the archbishop Jens Grand.

Queen

Queen Ingeborg was described as beautiful and tender; songs describe how she asked for a prison amnesty at her wedding, and contemporary songs both in Denmark and Sweden praise her for her compassion and sense of justice.  She was a popular queen in Denmark, where she was referred to as ""gode Frue"" or 'the Good Lady'.

There is no information that she ever played any political role. Her husband was the ally of her eldest brother, King Birger, and her husband's sister queen Martha of Sweden during the Swedish throne conflicts: they received their son in 1306 after the Håtuna games, and later Birger and Martha themselves as refugees after the Nyköping Banquet in 1318.

She had eight sons who died as children, as well as six miscarriages, although the sources differ between eight and fourteen children: whatever the case, her many pregnancies led to miscarriages, or the birth of children who died soon after.

In 1318, Queen Ingeborg gave birth to a son who lived, which was a cause of great celebrations after so many miscarriages.  However, when the queen showed off the infant to the public from her carriage, the carriage suddenly broke and fell over, during which the infant fell from her grip, broke his neck and died.

Later life

After the death of her son, she entered the St. Catherine's Priory, Roskilde.  The reason for this is contradictory.   One version claims that she did this voluntarily; either because of sorrow for the death of her son, or alternatively, because of her grief caused by the deaths of her brothers, Erik Magnusson and Valdemar Magnusson.

According to another legend, she was forcibly confined to the convent by her husband, who blamed her for the death of their son.  According to another version, he had her imprisoned for being too involved in the political causes of her brothers.

Regardless of whether she was a guest or a prisoner of the monastery, it is known that she had been the benefactor of this particular convent prior to entering it.

In 1319, she allegedly foretold the death of herself, her spouse and the archbishop. She died soon after, followed by her husband.

She was buried in Ringsted Kirke with the inscription: 
""I, Ingeborg of Sweden, once queen of Denmark, ask for forgiveness from anyone to whom I may have caused sorrow, to be please to forgive me and to remember my soul. I died in the year of Our Lord 1319.""

Other training organisations include Aeropower (Helicopters), Queensland Helicopter School (Helicopters), Aircraft Australia (Aeroplane), Fly Now (Aeroplane) and Bob Tait's Theory School.

Emergency and medical transfer aircraft now meet ambulances at the airfield since the closure of the Redcliffe Hospital Helipad in 2014.

Each year in August for World Helicopter Day a large open day event is held and is one of the biggest helicopter events in the southern hemisphere.

Fuel services at the airfield include bowsers for Jet A1 and AVGAS.

Airlines and destinations

Urban Encroachment
Like many small town airports, Redcliffe Airport has slowly seen residential development approved that places houses in what has previously been buffer zones or wetlands. Users of the airfield have set up a noise monitoring program to help identify noise hotspots and to educate local residents on the noise-abatement procedures already adhered to by pilots.

The version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in the Worcester Chronicle says that in 735 he succeeded Pehthelm, after the latter's death, as Bishop of Whithorn. The only other source for Frithwald is the entry in versions D and E of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which, sub anno 762, relate that:Frithwald, bishop at Whithorn, died on the Nones of May [May 7]. He was consecrated at Chester on the eighteenth before the Kalends of September [August 15], in the sixth winter of Ceolwulf's kingship [734/5]; and he was bishop twenty-nine wintersFriþuweald biscop æt Hwiterne forðferde on Nonas Maius, se wæs gehalgod on Ceastre on .xviii. Kalendas September þam .vi. wintra Ceolwulfes rices, 7 he wæs biscop .xxix. wintra. If the Worcester source is correct, that would put his death in 764; the entry is also sometimes thought to cover the year 763.

289,10178118,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%20Forces%20of%20Zimbabwe,Special Forces of Zimbabwe,"Special Forces of Zimbabwe are the units of the Zimbabwe National Army that operate as special forces. These forces have been deployed in several African conflicts, including the Mozambique Civil War and the Second Congo War.

Antecedents
In 1980 Prime Minister Robert Mugabe declared integration of Rhodesian Army, which at independence was the existing army, with the two guerilla armies: Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). This meant Rhodesian Special forces were quickly disbanded and refounded. The Selous Scouts were disbanded and became the 1 Parachute Regiment. 1 Commando Brigade was created based on the Rhodesian Light Infantry and Rhodesian African Rifles. British advisors refounded the Special Air Service. Special Forces selection and training were taken from the ones used by Rhodesian army Special forces.

The first operation of the new Special Forces lasted from December 5 to 9 in 1984. Operation Lemon comprised elements of 3 Brigade, the Parachute Group and Special Air Service. Special Forces were deployed to Mozambique to protect the Beira Corridor railway link between Zimbabwe and the port of Beira.

Composition
According to Jane's Special Forces Recognition Guide, Special Forces in the Zimbabwe National Army include:

 One Commando Regiment (formerly One Commando Battalion, previously the Rhodesian Light Infantry), based at Cranborne Barracks, Harare. The commando regiment is led by Lieutenant Colonel Hwami Vengesai. Selection phase include four-day navigating day and night in the Zambezi Valley while carrying a 30 kg weight on an empty stomach. Selection course runs for 21 days starting at the regiment and completed by a final 120 km 48 hour navigation to wafa wafa training grounds in Kariba. Further training curriculum includes river crossing, mountain climbing, reconnaissance, anti-hijacking, sniping, unarmed combat, tracking and bush craft. Also included is jungle survival on wild fruits and natural remedies for medical treatment. The training curriculum and professional standards are reported extremely demanding that those who complete it are highly respected in the ZNA.  Upon completion of selection and training, the soldiers graduate and are allowed to wear the distinguishing features of the commando regiment, and identify themselves as Commandos. Their operators wear the Tartan Green beret and stable belt, the Commando dagger patch on the side of the chest, and the shoulder tabs engraved commando and special forces. The men in character are said to be different from other regular soldiers. Their character profile is found with it courage, discipline, fearlessness, above average motivation, supreme aggression, a willingness to engage in lawfully extreme military violence to solve violent problems, that they are the deadliest and the best, physically very fit, that nobody is better than them,that they never will run away from the enemy or surrender in battle, that where regular troops have failed is where their job starts, that they are the cream of the ZNA. Their motto is ""No mission is impossible until one drops dead"". Together with the SAS they are said with the GI Joe's of the ZNA.
 One Parachute Regiment (sometimes referred to as Parachute Group) at Andre' Rabie Barracks just north of Harare. The Regiment was originally reconstituted from the Selous Scouts Regiment. The Regiment is led by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mazaiwana. Paras wear Maroon beret.
 Combat Diving Unit. Special Boat Squadron based in Nyami Nyami Kariba
 Special Air Service - based at Kabrit Barracks, adjacent to Harare Airport and at Inkomo baracks under the command of Colonel Panga Kufa. The SAS never allowed women to be recruited into the unit. Members wear the sandy/beige tan beret with the flaming sword imprinted their motto: who dares wins. The Zimbabwe SAS beret, blue stable belt and other distinguishing features are exactly the same as those of UK 22 SAS regiment showing the parentage and deep close links that once existed on the founding of the Zim SAS. Therefore, Zim SAS is directly modelled after the British SAS. They also do not wear their distinguishing features publicly even during other army programs but wear those of other units outside their premises. It is revered as the finest unit of the Zimbabwe special forces. Selection and training are the most extensive and toughest of any course ZNA has to offer in pursuit of the very top of the cream of fighting men. It is the only tier 1 special missions unit of the ZDF in modern warfare. In principle it is the equivalent of US army's Delta Force,UK 22 SAS regiment and Sayeret Matkal of the Israeli army. Upon completion of selection and training, the Zim SAS operators are to solve and conduct the most complex and demanding special missions far beyond the proficiency or capability of any other unit of the ZDF, shaming even the standards of the elite commando and Parachute regiments. The Zim SAS being a special task force are trained to conduct surgical raids, precision strikes, counter terrorism, direction of air strikes, counter insurgency, long range reconnaissance, special reconnaissance, hostage rescue, VIP protection, sabotage, infiltration, kidnapping, direct action, surreptitious entry, psychological warfare, intimidation, assassinations, foreign internal defense, chemical and biological warfare, siege breaking, linguistics, proficiency in small arms, navigation, camouflage, unarmed combat, close quarter battle amongst others. They possess the capability of also training, organising, and advising a host nations para-military and military forces for the sustenance of internal security as recently being deployed in the Mozambique insurgency against terrorist organisations troubling the host country. When called for, they also possess the capabilities of aiding other Zimbabwe government agencies in the pursuit of strategic national operations. The Zim SAS is the most secretive of all Zimbabwe army units and the government never comments about them nor is its information readily available.  Close links exist between the Zim SAS and the Zim Parachute Regiment as does the UK SAS with its Parachute regiment. It must be noted that the Zim SAS from its formations to around 1998 had very close links with its parent unit like UK 22 SAS and other commonwealth similar units like NZ and Aus SAS. They once cross trained together to exchange critical skills and raise quality in the pursuit of excellence. However, since Zimbabwe conducted land reforms and severed good relations with the UK and its allies, the Zim SAS suffered by being excluded from participating in such crucial exchange programs. This raises  questions about its present quality when compared to its other traditional equivalents. It is now partnered to similar Chinese and Russian special forces on exchange programs. However, in Africa it arguably is amongst the very finest units given its achievements in the second Congo war and its history. It remains the only unit in Africa and the only black country officially authorised to wear the distinguishing features of an ""SAS operator"" and also use the title, ""Special Air Service Regiment"".

During the DRC second war, the SAS and commando regiment are forever honored from their professional  performance as the greatest ever special forces to ever operate on African soil and for that type of warfare. Others argue even equal and better than US or UK special forces given their failures in the 1990s Mogadishu campaign in Somalia.

 Zimbabwe Mounted Infantry or Grey's Scouts, a horse-mounted reconnaissance unit. The main unit used to be based at Guinea Fowl. The battalion conducts border patrols and anti-poaching operations. The regiment is commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bothwell Brian Chigaba.
 Boat Squadron with five sub-units:
A Troop, with a strength of 40 men,  equipped with a few interceptor craft.
B Troop with assault boats to ferry troops ashore
C Troop, with a large transporter, the Ubique—a 72 tonne landing craft capable of carrying 30 tonnes of men and equipment including armoured cars. Ubique was also armed with 12.7 and 7.62 mm machine guns for self-protection and covering fire purposes.
D Troop, a support group trained for protecting beachheads and making assault landings for non-specialised units, employing mortar and support weapons.
E Troop was deployed for the purposes of guarding the harbours on Lake Kariba and around the rest of the squadron, as required.
There is also a diving school, equipped with a decompression chamber, operated in
conjunction with the commandos.

Operations

Angola
Some sources claim Zimbabwean commandos led the final assault on UNITA leading to the eventual killing of Jonas Savimbi. Zimbabwe sent 2,000 troops to help the Angola government end the war.

Mozambique
Special Forces launched several search and destroy operations against RENAMO guerrillas.

 5–9 December 1984 the Parachute Group and Special Air Service (SAS) spearheaded Operation Lemon.
 20 August 1985 in Operation Grapefruit the Parachute Group and One Command Battalion supported 3 Brigade in taking over the MNR Muxamba base.
 28 August 1985 SAS and Commando Regiment units lead raid on Casa Banana.
 24 January 1986 in Operation Octopus, Paras and Commandos were dropped near Marromeu to secure the town and the sugar refinery. 27 January 1986 several Para drops were made in support of the operation.

Congo
Zimbabwean commandos led by Captain Chrispen Nyachiwowo defended Kinshasa at the last minute when it was on the brink of falling to rebels and invading Ugandan and Rwandan army units. On this last-minute defense of Kinshasa, nothing but professionalism and history was made, registering Zimbabwean commandos to arguably be amongst the world's best as only 24 men from diamond squadron were used for the 24-hour special mission with 20 returning alive reporting mission complete. The mission was very tough as the enemy was just left with but a few hours to declare DRC a colony, Kinshasa being surrounded and overrun by armed rebels until the Zim commandos arrived in enviable style around 12 noon and the following day around 12 noon after heavy fighting and successfully repelling the enemy sabed DRC. Nothing but tactical superiority and better trained special men rendered the mission a success. The names of these deadly commandos are engraved on a roll of honor at the commando barracks in exemplary remembrance to the High standards and excellence demanded of those qualified to wear the tartan green beret and dagger. Due to the river networks in the DRC, the Boat Squadron saw extensive use during the course of Zimbabwe's involvement.

In August 1998, the ZDF had one SAS squadron supporting a battalion of paratroopers defending N’Djili from a Rwandan offensive. The Parachute Regiment suffered a heavy blow when 15 soldiers and their CASA 212 were captured after landing on an airstrip already controlled by the invading forces. It is believed the DRC government army unit they were supposed to join had defected to the rebels.

Zimbabwean SAS ambushed a column of rebel Type-59 tanks close to Kinshasa, knocking out the lead tank and creating panic in the rest of crews that abandoned their tanks and ran away. When the rebels attacked the airport, Zimbabwean SAS and paratroopers remained in possession of the military side of the airport plus the control tower and eventually defeated the offensive.

The battle of Kinshasa was won by the Air force of Zimbabwe, which operated from the section of the airport controlled by ZDF troops. It played a crucial role in the securing of Kinshasa as the ZNA could not move since the rebels were all over the place. It was the jets of 5 squadron, which played a crucial role together with helicopter squadrons of the AFZ who managed to neutralise the rebels by destroying their tanks and heavy artillery.

The AFZ gained a lot of respect as they demonstrated expertise and professionalism throughout the entire war. It was the Zimbabwean airmen who secured the Matadi corridor, Bukavu and the Inga dam with the support of the Zim commandos, SAS, Paras and Amphibious sqn.

291,19039923,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD%2016955,HD 16955,"HD 16955, also known as HR 803, is a double or multiple star. With an apparent visual magnitude of 6.376, is lies at or below the nominal limit for visibility with a typical naked eye. The measured annual parallax shift is 9.59 milliarcseconds, which yields an estimated distance of around 340 light years. The star is moving closer to the Sun with a heliocentric radial velocity of around -10 km/s.

This is an A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A3 V. Hauck et al. (1995) identified this as a Lambda Boötis star with a circumstellar shell, but this now appears to be unlikely. It has 2.25 times the mass of the Sun and is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 175 km/s. The star is radiating about 27 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of roughly 8,450 K.

HD 16955 has a magnitude 10.36 companion, component B, which is located, as of 2015, at an angular separation of 3.0 arcseconds along a position angle of 19°. This is the likely source for the detected X-ray emission with a luminosity of  coming from these coordinates, since A-type stars are not expected to emit X-rays. Component C is a more distant magnitude 12.94 companion located at a separation of 51.10 arcseconds along a position angle of 92°, as of 2015.

293,11014841,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anything%20Goes%20%28Cole%20Porter%20song%29,Anything Goes (Cole Porter song),"""Anything Goes"" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical of the same name. (1934). Many of the lyrics include humorous references to figures of scandal and gossip from Depression-era high society. One couplet refers to Samuel Goldwyn's box-office failure Nana starring Anna Sten, whose English was said to be incomprehensible to all except Goldwyn. (Goldwyn was from Poland and Sten from Ukraine.)

A recording by Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra (vocal by Ramona Davies) was very popular in 1934.

Later recordings

1950s–80s
Frank Sinatra recorded the song for Capitol from October 17, 1955, to January 16, 1956. His version was included on Songs for Swingin' Lovers! in March 1956. Almost simultaneously, Chris Connor recorded the song on either January 23 or February 8 on her first album for Atlantic. Months later, Ella Fitzgerald released the first of two versions. Recorded between February 7 and March 27 of the same year for Verve, her first version was released on Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook. In 1972, Atlantic released Ella Loves Cole. This second version was arranged by Nelson Riddle. Also on Verve, Stan Getz and Gerry Mulligan released an instrumental rendition of the song in 1957 on their album Getz Meets Mulligan in Hi-Fi on which they switched instruments. Tony Bennett first recorded the song on January 3 or 5, 1959, with the Count Basie Orchestra for Roulette. The recording was released on Basie Swings, Bennett Sings, also known as Strike Up the Band. The Dave Brubeck Quartet recorded the song for the 1966 album Anything Goes! The Dave Brubeck Quartet Plays Cole Porter; Brubeck and his quartet recorded their version of the song between December 8, 1965, and February 17, 1966, for Columbia. The song was recorded by Harpers Bizarre and released as a single in 1967. The group's version peaked at number forty-three on the Billboard pop singles chart and at number six on the Adult Contemporary.

Almost two decades later, the song was partially translated into Mandarin for the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, presumably with some assistance from John Williams, who arranged the film score. The song is performed by Kate Capshaw's character as the film's opening scene. The song is performed with a number of synchronized dancers in a large cabaret number set in a Shanghai night club circa 1935. The song is included on the original film soundtrack.

The 1982 Royal Variety Performance featured Peter Skellern performing the song.

1990s–present
There have been other cast recordings. John Barrowman performed the song in the 2003 West End revival; his performance was released on Anything Goes (2003 National Theatre's London Cast Recording). Sutton Foster, with Company, also performed the song in the 2011 Broadway revival; the performance is included Anything Goes Sondheim Theatre Broadway Cast Recording. This cast recording, from the 2011 revival, debuted at number 1 on Billboard's Cast Album Chart. As a recurring cast member of the Fox television series Glee, Lindsay Pearce performed the song in a mashup with the show tune ""Anything You Can Do"" written by Irving Berlin for the Broadway musical Annie Get Your Gun. She performed the mashup during the season three episode ""The Purple Piano Project"" that was broadcast on September 20, 2011. The single peaked at No. 185 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Ashleigh Murray performed the song in an episode of the third season of the television series Riverdale.

Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga first collaborated when they sang ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" for Bennett's Grammy Award-winning album, Duets II, then on the album Cheek to Cheek (2014). The recording took place over a year in New York City. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones, and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. With Marion Evans, jazz trumpeter Brian Newman, a long-time friend and colleague of Gaga, played on the album. Tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and flautist Paul Horn performed. The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga; they selected tracks from the Great American Songbook, including ""Anything Goes"".

Bennett sang ""Anything Goes"" on his album Strike Up the Band (1959), which Gaga heard when she was 13 years old. She thought ""Anything Goes"" was a funny track with a ""real sexy, powerful vibe to it, and it's just because we're having fun singing it."" Gaga and Bennett switched lyrics. The recording was described by Bobby Olivier of The Star-Ledger as ""smooth as silk...Gaga's voice, when stripped of its bells and whistles, showcases a timelessness that lends itself well to the genre."" Instrumentation comes from horns, cymbals, and saxophones. Photographer Steven Klein shot the album covers developed the cover art showing Gaga and Bennett in a newspaper cut.

Release and reception
Howard Reich of Chicago Tribune gave a positive review, saying found Gaga to be in ""good voice"" and Bennett in ""classic form"". Bree Jackson at V magazine called the song a ""fresh take"" on the original. MTV News critic Gil Kaufman said, ""Gaga is clearly having a blast, doing her best Broadway belting with tons of energy and enthusiasm"". Alexa Camp at Slant Magazine called Gaga's performance ""blatantly affected, marred by shouting and clichéd phrasing."" Edwin McFee at Hot Press called the song ""tawdry"" and ""stale"". ""Gaga attempting to out-sing Bennett was a terribly misguided decision"". The song received a nomination for Record Production/Single or Track at the 30th Annual TEC Awards under the category of Outstanding Creative Achievement Awards.

In the United Kingdom, ""Anything Goes"" debuted at number 174 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending August 9, 2014. It also charted at number 132 on the sales chart of the Official Charts Company. In Spain it debuted within the top-fifty of the PROMUSICAE singles chart at number 40. ""Anything Goes"" debuted outside the top 100 of the French Singles Chart, at number 178. On the Billboard Jazz Digital Songs chart, the track debuted at the top, becoming Gaga's second entry on that chart, following ""The Lady is a Tramp"". The song was Bennett's 15th entry on the Jazz Digital Songs chart, and his third number-one single. According to Nielsen SoundScan, ""Anything Goes"" sold 16,000 digital downloads in the US up to the week ending August 3, 2014. The song dropped to number three on Jazz Digital Songs chart the next week but moved back to number two the week after.

294,858642,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidal%20Sassoon,Vidal Sassoon,"Vidal Sassoon  (17 January 1928 – 9 May 2012) was a British hairstylist, businessman, and philanthropist. He was noted for repopularising a simple, close-cut geometric hairstyle called the bob cut, worn by famous fashion designers including Mary Quant and film stars such as Mia Farrow, Goldie Hawn, Cameron Diaz, Nastassja Kinski and Helen Mirren.

His early life was one of extreme poverty, with seven years of his childhood spent in an orphanage. He quit school at age 14, soon holding various jobs in London during World War II. Although he hoped to become a professional football player, he became an apprentice hairdresser at the suggestion of his mother.

After developing a reputation for his innovative cuts, he moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, where he opened the first chain of worldwide hairstyling salons, complemented by a line of hair-treatment products.

He sold his business interests in the early 1980s and began funding Israeli think tanks with his profits. Vidal Sassoon: The Movie, a documentary film about his life, was released in 2010. In 2009, Sassoon was appointed CBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. In 2012, he was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of the last six decades.

Early life
Sassoon was born to Jewish parents in Hammersmith, West London, and lived nearby in Shepherd's Bush. His mother, Betty (Bellin) (1900–1997), an Ashkenazi Jew, was born in Aldgate, in the East End of London, in 1900. Although she was surrounded by grinding poverty, Sassoon writes that she nonetheless resolved to make the best of her life. Her family had emigrated to England from Ukraine in the 1880s to escape the antisemitism and pogroms then prevalent. His father, Jack Sassoon, a Sephardi Jew, was born in Thessaloniki, in the northern part of Greece. They met in 1925 and married in 1927. They then moved to Shepherd's Bush, which contained a community of Greek Jews. Sassoon had a younger brother, Ivor, who died from a heart attack at the age of 46.

His father abandoned the family for another woman when Vidal was three years old. With his mother now unable to support the family, they fell into poverty and were evicted, becoming suddenly homeless. They were forced to move in with his mother's older sister. There, they shared a two-room tenement with his aunt and her three children. The tiny flat where the seven of them lived had no bathroom or inside toilet, forcing them to share the one outside landing toilet with three other families. He remembered often standing in line to use it in freezing weather. Their roof was also falling apart, which let rain pour through. ""All we could see from our windows was the greyness of the tenement across the street,"" writes Sassoon. ""There was ugliness all around.""

Due to poverty as a single parent, his mother eventually placed Sassoon and his younger brother in a Jewish orphanage, where they stayed for seven years, until he was 11, when his mother remarried. His mother was only allowed to visit them once a month and was never allowed to take them out.

Education
He attended Essendine Road Primary School, a Christian school of about a thousand children. He was frequently taunted by classmates as a ""Yid"" or with chants of ""All Jews have long noses."" One of his proudest days at the school was winning the 100-yard dash in an all-school contest. ""The urge to win has never left me,"" he writes.

However, he says that he was ""a very bad student"" with abysmal grades in most classes, except for mental arithmetic. After one session of mental arithmetic, his master said teasingly, ""Sassoon, it is a pleasure to see that you have gaps of intelligence between bouts of ignorance."" He took a volunteer job as a choir boy for the local synagogue, which gave him one of the few chances to see his mother, who would come on Saturdays.

Sassoon and the other children at the school were evacuated after WWII began on 3 September 1939. He was eleven. ""It's a date I'll never forget,"" he said. ""Suddenly my brother and I and all our fellow orphans were on trains with hundreds of thousands of other kids, moving out of London."" He and his brother were taken to Holt, Wiltshire, a small village of a thousand people.""

First jobs 

After his return to London he left school at the age of 14 and worked as a messenger. The war was in full force with London still being bombed, which forced him to sleep in underground shelters. During work hours, he said ""I got used to seeing bodies and blood, and hearing cries of agony"" as he carried messages from central London to the docks.

Upon the insistence of his mother, they tried to get him into a hairdressing apprenticeship; his mother told him that her ambition was for him to become a professional hairdresser. However, he saw himself becoming a football player, a sport he excelled at. ""I could not imagine myself backcombing hair and winding up rollers for a living.""

When she took him to the hairdressing school of a well-known stylist, Adolph Cohen, they were disappointed immediately when they were told it was a two-year programme and would cost much more than they could afford. ""My mother looked so terribly dejected,"" he said, as they left the salon. ""I thought she might faint."" A few minutes later, Mr. Cohen called them back to the salon, then told him, ""You seem to have very good manners, young man. Start Monday and forget the cost."" His mother began to cry out of joy.

Wartime activities
At the age of 17, although he had been too young to serve in World War II, he became the youngest member of the 43 Group, a Jewish veterans' underground organisation founded by Morris Beckman which broke up fascist meetings in East London. The Daily Telegraph calls him an ""anti-fascist warrior-hairdresser"" whose aim was to prevent Sir Oswald Mosley's movement from spreading ""messages of hatred"" in the period following World War II.

In 1948, at the age of 20, he joined the Palmach (which shortly afterwards was integrated into the Israeli Defence Forces) and fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which began after Israel declared statehood. During an interview, he described the year he spent training with the Israelis as ""the best year of my life,"" and recalled how he felt:

Career
Sassoon trained under Raymond Bessone in his salon in Mayfair. Sassoon opened his first salon in 1954 in London; singer-actress Georgia Brown, his friend and neighbour, claimed to be his first customer.

Sassoon stated his intentions in designing new, more efficient, hair styles: ""If I was going to be in hairdressing, I wanted to change things. I wanted to eliminate the superfluous and get down to the basic angles of cut and shape."" Sassoon's works include the geometric perm and the ""Nancy Kwan"" hairstyles. They were all modern and low-maintenance. The hairstyles created by Sassoon relied on dark, straight, and shiny hair cut into geometric yet organic shapes.

In 1964, Sassoon created a short, angular hairstyle cut on a horizontal plane that was the recreation of the classic ""bob cut."" His geometric haircuts seemed to be severely cut, but were entirely lacquer-free, relying on the natural shine of the hair for effect. Advertising and cosmetics executive Natalie Donay is credited with discovering Sassoon in London and bringing him to the United States, where in 1965 he opened his first New York City salon on Madison Avenue.

In 1966, inspired by 1920s film star Clara Bow's close cropped hair, he created designs for Emanuel Ungaro. Director Roman Polanski brought him to Hollywood from London in 1968, at a cost of $5,000 (), to create a unique pixie cut for Mia Farrow, who was to star in Rosemary's Baby.

In the early 1970s Sassoon made Los Angeles his home. In 1971 he promoted his 30-year-old second-in-command, artistic director Roger Thompson, to director of the Sassoon salon, explaining jocularly that, ""Twenty-five years of schlepping behind a barber chair are enough!"" John Paul DeJoria, a friend of Sassoon, co-founded Paul Mitchell Systems with Paul Mitchell, one of Sassoon's former students. Mitchell said that Sassoon was ""the most famous hairstylist in the history of the world.""

Sassoon began his ""Vidal Sassoon"" line of hair-care products in 1973. The actor Michael Caine, who when young and struggling ""was roommates with Terence Stamp and Vidal Sassoon – he used to cut my hair, and he always had a lot of models around,"" claimed to have inspired this, saying,  ""I told him that he must have something that is working for him while he slept. I told him he had to make shampoos and other hair-care products."" Whatever the inspiration, Sassoon's brand was applied to shampoos and conditioners sold worldwide, with a commercial campaign featuring the slogan ""If you don't look good, we don't look good."" Former salon colleagues also bought Sassoon's salons and acquired the right to use his name, extending the brand in salons into the United Kingdom and the United States.

The El Paso, Texas-based Helen of Troy Corporation began manufacturing and marketing Sassoon hair-care products in 1980. In 1983, Richardson-Vicks purchased the Los Angeles-based Vidal Sassoon Inc. as well as Sassoon's Santa Monica, California, hairdressing school; the company had already bought his European businesses. Sassoon's 1982 sales of hair products had topped $110 million, with 80 percent of revenues derived in the US.

Two years later the company was bought by Procter & Gamble. Vidal, who remained a consultant through at least the mid-1990s, sued in 2003 for breach of contract and fraud in federal court for allegedly neglecting the marketing of his brand name in favour of the company's other hair product lines, such as Pantene.

He sold his business interests in the early 1980s to devote himself to philanthropy. By 2004, it was reported that Sassoon was no longer associated with the brand that bears his name. He also had a short-lived television series called Your New Day with Vidal Sassoon, which aired in 1980.

Sassoon was twice a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, on 27 June 1970 and 9 October 2011, when he was also Resident Thinker on the Nowhereisland art project. He was a mystery guest on What's My Line? in March 1967.

Honours 
Sassoon was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in the 2009 Birthday Honours.

Personal life

Sassoon married his first wife, Elaine Wood, his salon receptionist, in 1956; the marriage ended in 1958. In 1967, he married his second wife, actress Beverly Adams. They had three biological children and one adopted son: daughter Catya (1968–2002), an actress who died from a drug-induced heart attack; son Elan BenVidal  (b. 17 January 1970); son David (b. circa 1972); and daughter Eden Sassoon. Some sources additionally cite Oley Sassone, a music-video director who spells his last name slightly differently, as a son but this appears to be in error. Sassoon and Adams divorced after 13 years of marriage. His third wife was Jeanette Hartford-Davis, a dressage champion and former fashion model; they married in 1983 and divorced soon after. In 1992, he married designer Rhonda ""Ronnie"" Sassoon.

Sassoon disinherited his son David, with whom he was estranged. Sassoon in his 2010 autobiography described David, adopted in 1975 at age 3, as an ""African-American / Asian boy ... with twinkling eyes and an irresistible smile"" who nonetheless became troubled and was eventually sent to a reform school.

Philanthropy
Having had a lifelong commitment to eradicating anti-Semitism, Sassoon started the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism, or SICSA, in 1982. Located at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, it is devoted to gathering information about antisemitism worldwide.

After selling his company, he then worked towards philanthropic causes such as the Boys Clubs of America and the Performing Arts Council of the Music Center of Los Angeles via his Vidal Sassoon Foundation. He was also active in supporting relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. It also funded educational pursuits on a need-basis in Israel and elsewhere. At the time of his death he had academies in England, the United States and Canada, while initiating plans to open new ones in Germany and China.

Illness and death
In June 2011 it was reported that Sassoon had been diagnosed with leukemia two years earlier. He died on 9 May 2012 at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles. His death was originally reported to be a result of natural causes, and later reported to have been a result of his leukemia. He died in the presence of his family. Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Kevin Maiberger said that when the police arrived at his residence at Mulholland Drive he was already dead. A memorial service was planned for a later date.

Legacy 

""Vidal was like Christopher Columbus,"" said Angus Mitchell, who studied under Sassoon. ""He discovered that the world was round with his cutting system. It was the first language that people could follow."" Neil Cornelius, the incumbent owner of Sassoon's first solo venture, called him a ""hairdressing legend"".

Grace Coddington, Sassoon's former model and creative director of American Vogue, said that he changed the way the public looked at hair:

John Barrett of the John Barrett Salon at Bergdorf Goodman said that Sassoon ""was the creator of sensual hair. This was somebody who changed our industry entirely, not just from the point of view of cutting hair but actually turning it into a business. He was one of the first who had a product line bought out by a major corporation"".

He was the son of Mikal, a nobleman who had left Iraq and settled in Khurasan, and could trace his descent back to the Sogdian ruler Divashtich. Muhammad also had a brother named Shah ibn Mikal, who, during his early career, along with Muhammad, played an important role under the Tahirid ruler Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani. In 864, the Alid Hasan ibn Zayd conquered Tabaristan from the Tahirids, while another Alid named Muhammad ibn Ja'far ibn al-Hasan expelled the Tahirid governor of Ray, and captured the city. The Tahirid ruler Muhammad ibn Tahir shortly sent an army from Khurasan under Muhammad ibn Mikal, who managed to recapture the city and capture Muhammad ibn Ja'far. Hasan, however, quickly made a counter-attack under his Dailamite general Wajin, who managed to rout the army of Muhammad ibn Mikal, and kill the latter.

Muhammad had a son named Abd-Allah Mikali, who achieved prominence under the Saffarids, a dynasty which had conquered Khurasan from the Tahirids.

304,20216272,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA%20transporter,GABA transporter,"GABA transporters (Gamma-Aminobutyric acid transporters) belong to the family of neurotransmitters known as sodium symporters, also known as solute carrier 6 (SLC6). These are large family of neurotransmitter which are Na+ concentration dependent. They are found in various regions of the brain in different cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes.

These transporters are primarily responsible for the regulation of extracellular GABA concentration during basal and synaptic activity. They are responsible for creating a GABA gradient which is determined by the membrane potential, and the concentration of Na+ and Cl−. They are also present on the plasma membrane of neurons and glia which help define their function of regulation of GABA concentration as they act as the receptors that facilitate recycling of GABA in the extracellular space. GABA transporters are a common target for anticonvulsant drugs against seizure disorders such as epilepsy.

Types 

The GABA transporter group consists of six different transporters:

 GABA transporter type 1 (GAT1; SLC6A1)
 GABA transporter type 2 (GAT2; SLC6A13)
 GABA transporter type 3 (GAT3; SLC6A11)
 Betaine transporter (BGT1; SLC6A12)
 Creatinine transporter 1 (CT1; SLC6A8)
 Taurine transporter (TauT; SLC6A6)

GAT1 and GAT3 are the major GABA transporters in the brain and spinal cord, expressed by both neurons and some astrocytes. GAT2 and BGT1 are also expressed in the brain, but at low levels and mostly in the meninges. GAT2 also transports taurine, while BGT1 transports betaine. These two transporters are predominantly expressed in the liver, but are also found in the kidneys and, as mentioned above, in the meninges.

Function 

GABA transporters in the plasma membrane help in regulating the concentration of GABA in the extracellular matrix by reabsorbing the transmitter and clearing the synapse. They transiently bind to GABA in the extracellular matrix and translocate the transmitter in the cytoplasm. The GABA transmitters are not broken down but are cleared via GABA transporters through re-absorption from the synaptic cleft. There is only a 20% loss of the transmitters during each re-absorption while nearly 80% is recycled. The plasma membrane GABA transporters maintain an extracellular GABA concentration in the vicinity of the synapse to control the activity of the GABA receptors. The GABAergic synaptic transmission controls the generation of membrane potential rhythmic changes as the transporters are dependent on Na+ and Cl− ions moving in and out of the across the membrane which are determinants of membrane potential. These changes rely on the precise timing of GABA receptors activation which in turn are dependent upon the release and clearance of GABA in the extracellular space. This reuptake of neurotransmitters plays a significant role in the overall process of synaptic transmission. The GABA transporter is an active system, electrogenic, a voltage-dependent which relies on the inward electrochemical gradient of Na+ ions instead of ATP. It also has low micromolecular affinity to GABA with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.5 μM, and requires the presence of Cl- ions in the extracellular matrix. The GABA transporter help creates an equilibrium of GABA and will work in the reverse direction if needed to maintain the baseline concentration of GABA in the system.

Structure 
The structure of Sl6 family transporters share 20-25% sequence similarity with LeuTA providing an evolutionary relationship between the transporter and the leucine transporter protein. Because of the similarity, the LeuTa protein provides a very close template model for the studying the transporters in greater detail. The GABA transporter exists in two different conformations. The transporters have general structure of 12 alpha helices with both end - N Terminus and C-terminus in the cytoplasm with glycosylation sequence in the transmembrane helices. They also exhibit ligand gated ion channel properties as well as substrate dependent properties of leak current. The amino acid sequence ranges from 599 (GAT1) to 700 for glycine transporters.

Role in epilepsy 

GABA creates an inhibitory tone in the cerebral cortex to counterbalance the neuronal excitability. An imbalance between the excitability and inhibition often lead to seizures. To help with epilepsy disorder, anticonvulsant drugs are designed which specifically attack the GABA system. These drugs often attack the transporters blocking their activity, which affects the neuronal excitability.  Anticonvulsants such as Tiagabine attack the GABA transporters inhibiting the uptake of GABA neurotransmitter. In patients with temporal lobe seizures, there is a decrease in GABA release because of the impairment of transporters. Drugs such as Vigabatrin cause reversals in GABA transporters that increase the concentration of GABA in the synapse which helps in inhibiting the neuronal excitability.

Renovations and restorations 

An agreement was signed between Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and Devaswom Board for setting transit camp complexes (edathavaloms) for Sabarimala pilgrims in several Kerala temples, including Sukapuram, in 2018. The temple is expected to receive Rs. 10 crore from KIIFB to set up edathavaloms in one and a half year. Travancore Devaswom Board is expected to manage the KIIFB funded work. There were also calls from the temple officials to spend some amount of the funding to restore the medieval carvings in the srikovil of the temple.

The temple is expected to receive an additional 8 crores for renovation and restoration. This include funding from Archaeology Department and Government of Kerala (Tourism Circuit).

The festival in the month of January with caparisoned elephants and percussion is famous in the region.

Biography
Anderson was born near Pikeville, Tennessee in Bledsoe County on November 29, 1807. He attended the common schools, studied law, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Jasper, Tennessee.

Career
From 1833 to 1837, Anderson was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, serving as speaker. He was a member of the Tennessee Senate from 1843 to 1845, serving as its presiding officer.

Elected as a Whig to the Thirty-first United States Congress, Anderson served from March 4, 1849 to March 3, 1851. He was not a successful candidate for re-election in 1850 to the Thirty-second Congress.

Anderson was a delegate from Tennessee to the peace convention of 1861, held in Washington, D.C., in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending war. He was a colonel in the Tennessee State Militia in 1861.

Death
Anderson was killed at Looneys Creek, near the present town of Whitwell, Tennessee in Marion County on November 8, 1861 (age 53 years, 344 days), just after having made a secession speech. He is interred at the Anderson Family Cemetery, seven miles southeast of Dunlap, Tennessee in Sequatchie County.

An article in the North Carolina Standard newspaper, dated Wednesday, Nov. 27, 1861, states:

Murder of Hon. Josiah M. Anderson of Tennessee - On the day of the election, at or near Dunlap, Sequatchie County, Tennessee, Hon. Josiah M. Anderson was set upon by a band of Lincolnite assassins, and stabbed in the back, causing his instant death.  Col. Anderson formerly represented the Knoxville District in the Congress of the United States, and was a delegate from Tennessee in the ""Peace Congress.""  His only offense for which he was so basely assassinated, was his defense of the South in conversation.

310,18891728,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code%20golf,Code golf,"Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that solves a certain problem. Code golf challenges and tournaments may also be named with the programming language used (for example, Perl golf).

History 
The length of the shortest possible program that produces a given output (in any fixed programming language) is known as the Kolmogorov complexity of the output, and its mathematical study dates to the work of Andrey Kolmogorov in 1963. Code golf, however, can be more general than this, as it often specifies a general input-output transformation that must be performed rather than asking for a single output with no input.
 
Whilst the term ""code golf"" was apparently first used in 1999 with Perl, and later popularised through the use of Perl to write a program that performed RSA encryption, a similar informal competition is known to have been popular with earlier APL hackers. The challenging nature of aggressively optimizing for program size has itself long been recognized, for example a 1962 coding manual for Regnecentralen's GIER computer notes that ""it is a time-consuming sport to code with the least possible number of instructions"" and recommends against it for practical programming. Today the term has grown to cover a wide variety of languages, which has even triggered the creation of dedicated golfing languages.

Etymology 
The term ""code golf"" is derived from the similarity of its goal with that of conventional golf, where participants seek to achieve the lowest possible score, rather than the highest, as is the standard in most sports and game scoring systems. While conventional golf players are trying to minimize the number of club strokes needed to complete the course, code golfers are striving to reduce the number of key strokes necessary to write the program.

Dedicated golfing languages 
Several new languages have been created specifically with code golfing in mind. Examples include GolfScript, Flogscript and Vyxal, which are Turing-complete languages which provide constructs for concisely expressing ideas in code. Because golfing languages compete for extreme brevity, their design sacrifices readability, which is important for practical production environments, and therefore they are often esoteric. Sometimes, however, a language is designed for a practical purpose, but turns out to be suitable for code golf.

An example of GolfScript code to print 1000 digits of pi:
;''
6666,-2%{2+.2/@*\/10.3??2*+}*
`1000<~\;
This prints a string starting with ""3141592653"" followed by 990 more digits of pi.

Code golf websites include novel golfing languages created by users to win code golf challenges. Other popular languages include 05AB1E, Husk, Pyth, CJam and Jelly.

Types of code golf 
Some code golf questions, such as those posed on general programming sites, may not require implementation in a specific programming language. However, this limits the style of problems that it is possible for the problem designers to pose (for example, by limiting the use of certain language features). In addition, the creation of such ""open"" questions has resulted in the design of code golf specific programming language dialects such as REBMU (a dialect of REBOL). Both online and live competitions may also include time limits.

311,29530896,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff%20Godfrey,Jeff Godfrey,"Jeffrey Godfrey IV (born January 1, 1992) is an American football Slotback who is currently a free agent. Godfrey played for the University of Central Florida Knights. He led the Knights to the Conference USA Championship in his freshman year (2010), becoming the first true freshman quarterback to win an FBS conference championship game.

Following his sophomore year, Godfrey transitioned to the wide receiver position.

Early life
Godfrey was born to Jeffrey Godfrey, Jr., and Roshanda Spencer in Miami, Florida on November 1, 1990.  Godfrey attended high school at Miami Central High School, located in Miami, Florida. He graduated as the leading passer in Miami-Dade County history with 7,251 yards, beating the previous record set by Jacory Harris of Miami Northwestern. In high school, Godfrey was rated as one of the top quarterbacks in Florida, and amongst the nation's top 10 dual-threat quarterbacks. Due to his performance, Godfrey has been called ""Mr. Dade Football"".

During his senior year, he committed to UCF. He chose the Knights over Florida State, Miami, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, Ohio State, Oregon, USF and FIU.

College career

2010

Jeff Godfrey enrolled as a freshman in January 2010, and participated in spring practice. At the start of the season he was second on the depth chart behind starting junior quarterback Rob Calabrese.

In his first appearance, Godfrey took over during an opening-game rout of South Dakota, going 6-of-7 for 65 passing yards and a touchdown. He would then replace Calabrese the next week while UCF was losing to NC State. He stepped in with 5:17 to go in the third quarter, the Knights down 28–7, and led UCF on two touchdown drives to pull within one score. A fumble by one of his receivers on the third drive ended their comeback hopes with a 28–21 loss. Godfrey went 7-of-10 for 107 yards, and rushed for 53 yards, scoring both touchdowns himself.

Godfrey became the starting quarterback in the third game of the season against Buffalo, but with the understanding that he would still be splitting time with Rob Calabrese. Head coach George O'Leary felt it was important for Godfrey to watch a more experienced quarterback work as well before giving him full control of the offense. Godfrey ended up 15-of-24 with 130 passing yards, and rushed for 44 more yards.

Initially, Godfrey allowed the Knights' rushing offense to do the heavy lifting while he continued to develop his passing attack as a true freshman. During a game against UAB, Godfrey took a hard hit, forcing Calabrese to step in for the remainder of the drive. Godfrey would return and finish the game.

During UCF's game against Marshall on October 13,  Calabrese was brought in to run a ""Wild Knight"" play, UCF's take on the Wildcat formation. He scored a touchdown, but tore his ACL in the process, firmly establishing Godfrey as starter for the remainder of the season. When UCF hosted Rice on October 23, Godfrey threw his first touchdown pass since the opener, and finished 13-of-18 for 178 yards. From there he would take full control of the UCF offense, scoring two passing touchdowns in each of the next five games, while only throwing 2 interceptions the rest of the way. His signature game as a freshman would come against Houston on November 5, where he would go 15-of-19 for 294 yards with two passing touchdowns, and rush for 105 yards–his first 100-yard rushing game at UCF–with one touchdown.

As a starter, Godfrey went 8–2 in the regular season placing UCF in both the AP Poll and USA Today Poll for the very first time in the program's history. He also led the Knights to the Conference USA title against SMU earning them an invitation to the 52nd Annual AutoZone Liberty Bowl, A clash between the Georgia Bulldogs(SEC) and the UCF Knights (C-USA) with a final score of 10–6 UCF's first ever bowl win. He finished the season completing 159-of-238 passes for 2,159 yards with 13 TDs and 6 INTs, and rushed for 556 yards and 10 more touchdowns. All those numbers are second-most for a true-freshman starter in UCF history behind Daunte Culpepper. His 105-yard rushing game against Houston was the highest rushing total for any quarterback; he had surpassed Culpepper's record earlier in the season. Godfrey exceeded a 200 passer rating four times, and only went under 100 twice. He ended up winning the Conference USA Freshman of the Year award.

2011

Before the 2011 season, Godfrey was placed on the watch list for the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award, which is given to the nation's best quarterback.

After leading the Knights to a 5–7 record in 2011, Godfrey requested his release from the team, which was granted by Head Coach George O'Leary. Godfrey was allowed to rejoin the team in April 2012, though he switched positions to become a wide receiver.

Statistics

Professional career
In 2018, Godfrey signed with the Orlando Apollos of the AAF for the 2019 season. He was waived/injured before the start of the 2019 regular season and subsequently placed on injured reserve after clearing waivers. He was waived from injured reserve on March 26, 2019.

312,15991282,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missions%20H%C3%A9liographiques,Missions Héliographiques,"Missions Héliographiques was a 19th-century project to photograph landmarks and monuments around France so that they could be restored.

The project was established by Prosper Mérimée, France's Inspector General of Historical Monuments and author of Carmen, in 1851.  The intent was to supplement Monument historique, a program Mérimée started in 1837 to classify, protect and restore French landmarks. Mérimée hired Edouard Baldus, Hippolyte Bayard, Gustave Le Gray, Henri Le Secq and Auguste Mestral to carry out the photography, with the aim that architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc could eventually restore them.

Although the daguerrotype originated in France, Mérimée preferred the calotype, which offered more detailed textures.

Mestral and Le Gray photographed areas southwest from Paris, Le Secq the north and east. Bayard, who chose to work with glass negatives instead of paper, went west to Brittany and Normandy.  Baldus covered the south and east, including the Palace of Fontainebleau.

While several of the images are classic examples of early photography, the overall results did not meet requirements, often portraying the decaying buildings artistically and obscuring their need for restoration.

313,38607381,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute%20of%20Semitic%20Studies,Institute of Semitic Studies,"The Institute of Semitic Studies (ISS) is a nonprofit independent research institution based in Princeton, New Jersey dedicated to the academic study of Semitic (and other major Afroasiatic) languages and cultures. Its work seeks especially to highlight the contribution of Afroasiatic peoples to world civilization, in general, and Western culture, in particular. It was founded in Princeton in 1984 and then incorporated in 1985  and is currently directed by Ephraim Isaac a Harvard trained scholar and peace activist. The Institute also releases a bi-annual linguistically focused international scholarly journal entitled the Journal of Afroasiatic Languages (JAAL) published by the Red Sea Press. In addition to its academic journal, it also recently launched an academic monograph series called Afroasiatic Studies in collaboration with the Red Sea Press. The Institute of Semitic Studies is the first independent research institute that focuses on Semitic and Afroasiatic studies within the United States.

Major Achievements and Work
Among the Institute’s major achievements to date is the sponsorship of the 1989 symposium on the Dead Sea Scrolls. According to the Institute's website, ""This symposium was editorialized in the Washington Post as a commendable peace-making effort among bitterly quarreling scholars."".  In 1992, the Institute sponsored the Second International Congress of ""Yemenite Jewish Studies""  where the Congress brought together over 200 scholars and many interested individuals from Israel, Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. A congratulatory message was given by the future US President Bill Clinton and the then Prime Minister Shamir of Israel. Also, the Institute supports a Princeton Theological Seminary project to make the Dead Sea Scrolls publicly available in their original Hebrew and/or Aramaic, with new English translations. It supports the University of Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary Project. In 1988, it co-sponsored with the Univ. of Pennsylvania the 35th International Congress of Assyriology. In 1991, it co-sponsored with Princeton University the Fifth Congress of Judaeo-Arabic Studies and another on Ancient Iraq. It has organized other major scholarly projects and frequent public and educational programs. Among these are those on the Nabataeans, religions of pre-Islamic Arabia, and Ethiopic Christian manuscripts.

Collaborations
The Institute has collaborated with Princeton University, Princeton Theological Seminary, the University of Pennsylvania, the New York Bar Association, the Israeli Association for Society and Culture, as well as Pennsylvania Governor’s Cultural Affairs Department, the University of the Arts, Please Touch Me Museum, the Woodrow Wilson Institute, and many others.

Previous Donors
Support for the work of the Institute has come from various sources, but most notably the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the New Jersey Committee for the Humanities, the New York Committee for the Humanities, Bristol Myers Co, Blum Foundation, Lawrence Gelb Foundation, New York City Central Labor Council: AFL-CIO, State of Ben L. Burman, H. J. Stich Foundation, JDC, and many generous individuals all over the US.

Media Recognition
Even in its first years of establishment, the work of the Institute of Semitic Studies had caught national and international attention. In a little less than a decade, its work was reported in five front-page newspaper stories (New York Times, 3; Trenton Times, 2), and its role discussed in one major editorial (Washington Post). Stories about the work of the Institute have been featured in the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Christian Science Monitor, and several local, national, and international papers and other media including the BBC.

Mission and Peace-Activity
The Institute’s mission is to promote the unique and rich contributions of Semitic and Afroasiatic culture and language to world civilization through rigorous academic research. As an integral part of its mission, however, it also seeks to integrate its scholarship with peace-building efforts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East through the promotion of mutual understanding of common cultural and linguistic heritages. The institute is planning to build an African Peace Center in Princeton which would be to dedicated academic peace-building research and conflict mediation for conflict ridden regions in Africa.

315,28971030,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20conservation%20areas%20in%20Brighton%20and%20Hove,List of conservation areas in Brighton and Hove,"As of , there are 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove, a seaside resort on the English Channel coast in southeast England.  The definition of a conservation area is a principally urban area ""of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance"". Such areas are identified according to criteria defined by Sections 69 and 70 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.  Brighton and Hove City Council is responsible for creating conservation areas within the city, and expands upon the statutory definition by stating that each area has ""high townscape quality [and] its own distinctive character [... which] creates a sense of place"".

The city has existed in its present form only since 2000, when Queen Elizabeth II granted city status to the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove, which was in turn created in 1997 by the amalgamation of Brighton and Hove Borough Councils. Before 1997, the two councils were separately responsible for creating and administering conservation areas.  Hove Borough Council designated the first two, in 1969: Charles Busby's expansive self-contained Brunswick Town estate, with a twin-terrace centrepiece ""as grand as anything in St Petersburg"", and the rapidly developed mid-19th-century suburb of Cliftonville, characterised by Italianate villas and large Tudorbethan houses. The following year, Brighton Borough Council set up conservation areas to preserve and improve the historic centres of five ancient downland villages—Ovingdean, Patcham, Preston, Rottingdean and Stanmer—which became part of the urban area in 1928 and 1952 because of boundary changes.  Brighton's own architectural set-piece, Thomas Read Kemp's ""striking, [...] graceful and imposing"" Kemp Town estate of the mid-1820s, by Busby and Amon Wilds, was designated at the same time.

Many more parts of the urban area have been included in conservation areas in subsequent years, either through the creation of new areas or by means of extensions to existing areas.  One conservation area, Preston, was split into two (Preston Park and Preston Village) in 1988 after it had been extended several times. Carlton Hill, an inner-city area in the east of Brighton which descended into poverty-stricken slum conditions in the early 20th century, is the most recent addition to the list; about  of its historic centre was designated on 4 July 2008. In 2004, when Carlton Hill had not yet been designated, the proportion of Brighton and Hove's urban area covered by conservation areas was about 18%.

The city's conservation areas vary in character and size.  Stanmer—an isolated, rural country estate with a mansion, church and single-street village— is more than 200 times larger than the conservation area surrounding the similarly rural Benfield Barn, on the South Downs above Hangleton.  Brunswick Town and Kemp Town, by Busby and Wilds, are famous, high-class 19th-century planned estates, each with dozens of listed buildings (including many at the highest Grade I); each represents ""the pinnacle of [their] work and ... considerable achievements in domestic architecture and town design"". In contrast, areas such as Sackville Gardens and Cliftonville are small-scale, piecemeal suburban developments with varied architectural styles and few or no listed buildings. Woodland Drive and Tongdean have large 20th-century houses, while the Engineerium conservation area consists of formerly industrial buildings.

The government encourages but does not require local authorities to produce studies appraising the character of conservation areas. As of 2017, two of Brighton and Hove's areas lacked formal appraisal documents. The corresponding figure in 2004, when the city's conservation strategy was last revised, was 11.

Conservation areas

Extensions and changes

Section 69 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires local authorities not only to decide upon and designate conservation areas, but also to review their boundaries periodically. Furthermore, Brighton's Borough Plan (adopted in 1995) states that ""consideration will be given to the inclusion of additional areas within existing conservation areas"", and that ""the opportunity to review the boundaries further will be taken when detailed plans for each conservation area are produced"".

Many conservation areas have been extended since they were originally designated.  The first round of expansions came in 1977, when Brighton Borough Council changed the boundaries of East Cliff, Kemp Town, the Old Town, Queen's Park, Regency Square and Valley Gardens. East Cliff had a further three extensions: in 1989, 1991 and 2002.  The North Laine and neighbouring Valley Gardens areas were each extended in 1989 and 1995; Valley Gardens had already had a boundary change in 1988.  More was added to Regency Square's area in 2005, to Patcham in 1992, and to West Hill in 1995.  As originally created in 1970, Stanmer conservation area covered only Stanmer House, the village and its environs.  An extension in 1988 added much of the surrounding parkland, and more land was added in 2010.

Preston is the only instance of a conservation area being split.  Designated under that name in 1970, it was expanded in 1977, 1980 and 1981; in 1988, Brighton Borough Council decided to create two new areas, Preston Village and Preston Park, from this territory. The latter in turn expanded in 1995. A different approach was taken at Montpelier & Clifton Hill: until 2005 this conservation area was named ""Clifton"", but the council acknowledged that it covered territory in the Montpelier area of the city by introducing its present name in 2005.

Conservation areas are occasionally extended to include single buildings which contribute significantly to an area's character.  West Hill, whose residential development immediately followed the opening of Brighton railway station at the bottom of the hill in 1840, changed its boundaries to include it in 1988. The East Cliff conservation area's northern boundary is Eastern Road, but in 2010 consideration was given to extending it north of this at Upper Bedford Street to incorporate Thomas Lainson's Grade II-listed Pelham Institute, a High Victorian Gothic building of the 1870s, and the neighbouring Fitzherbert Centre—a disused early-20th-century school.

317,2678126,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard%20J%C3%A4ckel,Eberhard Jäckel,"Eberhard Jäckel (; 29 June 1929 – 15 August 2017) was a German historian. In the 1980s he was a principal protagonist in the Historians' Dispute (Historikerstreit) over how to incorporate Nazi Germany and the Holocaust into German historiography.

Career
Born in Wesermünde, Hanover, Jäckel studied history at Göttingen, Tübingen, Freiburg, Gainesville, and Paris after World War II. After serving as an assistant and docent at Kiel until 1966, he taught from 1967, following Golo Mann, as Professor for Modern History at the University of Stuttgart, a position he retained until retirement in 1997. 

Jäckel's PhD dissertation was turned into his first book c, 1966's Frankreich in Hitlers Europa (France In Hitler's Europe), a study of German policy towards France from 1933 to 1945. Jäckel first rose to fame through his 1969 book Hitlers Weltanschauung (Hitler's Worldview), which was an examination of Hitler's world view and beliefs. Jäckel argued that far from being an opportunist with no beliefs as had been argued by Alan Bullock, Hitler held to a rigid set of fixed beliefs, and he had consistently acted from his ""race and space"" philosophy throughout his career. In Jäckel's opinion, the core of Hitler's world view was his belief in what Hitler saw as the merciless struggle for survival between the ""Aryan race"" and the ""Jewish race"" and in his belief that stronger ""races"" possessed large amounts of Lebensraum (living space). In Jäckel's view, everything that Hitler did throughout his life stemmed from the beliefs he had adopted in the 1920s. Jäckel has argued that Hitler felt there were three factors that determined a people's ""racial value"" — namely its awareness of itself, the type of leadership it had, and its ability to make war. According to Jäckel, for Germany these meant ultranationalism, the Führerprinzip (Führer principle), and militarism, and all three were the constants of Hitler's beliefs throughout his life. In Jäckel's opinion, Mein Kampf is a long rant against the three principles that Hitler saw as the antithesis of his three sacred principles — namely, internationalism, democracy and pacifism. Jäckel asserts that for Hitler ""the originators and bearers of all three counterpositions are the Jews"". In Jäckel's view, in the Zweites Buch of 1928, Hitler:

established for the first time a logical link between his foreign policy conception and his antisemitism. They were synthesized in his view of history. With this, Hitler's Weltanschauung had finally achieved the kind of consistency for which he had groped for a long time.

In this way, Jäckel argues that Mein Kampf was not only a ""blueprint"" for power, but also for genocide. In Jäckel's view:

He [Hitler] had to annihilate the Jews, thus restoring the meaning of history, and with the thus restored, nature-intended struggle for existence, he at the same time had to conquer new living space for the German people. Each of these tasks was inextricably linked to the other. Unless the Jews were annihilated there would very soon no longer be any struggle for living space, nor therefore any culture and consequently nations would die out; not just the German nation, but ultimately all nations. But if, on the other hand, the German people failed to conquer new living space, it would die out because of that and the Jews would triumph.

Jäckel takes the view that Hitler's ideology developed in stages in the 1920s, and wrote ""It is an important fact that the final completion [of Hitler's ideology], contrary to Hitler's own statements, in 1919 had only begun"". In addition, Jäckel's book was noteworthy as the first account of Hitler's beliefs written in Germany by someone from the left. (Jäckel joined the SPD in 1967.) In regard to the foreign policy debates, Jäckel is a leading ""continentalist"", arguing that Nazi foreign policy aimed only at the conquest of Eastern Europe against the ""globalists,"" who argue that Hitler wanted world conquest

The Genesis of the Final Solution
Jäckel is one of the leading intentionalists in regard to the functionalism versus intentionalism debate, arguing from the 1960's on that there was a long-range plan on the part of Hitler to exterminate the Jewish people from about 1924 on, views that led to intense debates with functionalist historians such as Hans Mommsen and Martin Broszat. Jäckel dismissed the argument made by Broszat in his 1977 essay ""Hitler and the Genesis of the Final Solution"" that local officials began the Holocaust on their own initiative under the grounds that a:

great deal of evidence that some [local officials] were shocked or even appalled when the Final Solution came into effect. To be sure, they did not disagree with it. But they agreed only reluctantly, referring again to an order given by Hitler. This is a strong indication that the idea did not originate with them.

In the late 1970's, Jäckel was a leading critic of the British author David Irving and his book Hitler’s War, which argued that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. Jäckel in his turn wrote a series of newspaper articles which were later turned into the book David Irving's Hitler : A Faulty History Dissected attacking Irving and maintained that Hitler was very much aware of and approved of the Holocaust. Jäckel attacked Irving for claiming that an entry in Heinrich Himmler's notebook saying ""Jewish transport from Berlin, not to be liquidated"" on 30 November 1941 proved that Hitler did not want to see the Holocaust happen. Jäckel maintained that the order referred only to that train, and argued that if Hitler had ordered the people on that train to be spared, it must stand to reason that he was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel went on to argue that because the ""Final Solution"" was secret, it is not surprising that Hitler's servants were ignorant of the Holocaust, and that anyhow, five of Hitler's servants interviewed by Irving later claimed that they believed that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel argued that on the basis of Hitler's statements in Mein Kampf the Führer was always committed to genocide of the Jews, and that because Hitler later attempted to execute the foreign policy he outlined in Mein Kampf, it is a reasonable assumption that Hitler was always committed to genocide. As a sign of Hitler's intentions, Jäckel used Hitler's tendency to involve himself in minutiae to argue that it is inconceivable that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. Jäckel used Hitler's ""Prophecy Speech"" of January 30, 1939, where Hitler declared:

I shall once again be your prophet: if international Jewry with its financial power in and outside of Europe should manage once more to draw the peoples of the world into world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the world, and thus the victory of Jewry, but rather the total destruction of the Jewish race in Europe

Likewise, Jäckel used Himmler's Posen speeches of 1943 and certain other statements on his part in 1944 referring to an ""order"" from an unnamed higher authority as proof that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust. In the same way, Jäckel noted Hitler's order of 13 March 1941 that the Einsatzgruppen be reëstablished for Operation Barbarossa as proof of the Führer's involvement in the Holocaust. Jäckel also argued that the entry in Joseph Goebbels's diary on 27 March 1942 mentioning the Führer's ""Prophecy"" was coming true was a sign that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust, and accused Irving of dishonesty in claiming that there was no sign in the Goebbels diary that Hitler knew of the Holocaust. Finally, Jäckel noted the frequent references to the ""Prophecy Speech"" in Hitler's wartime speeches as a sign that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust.

In response to Jäckel's first article, Irving announced that he had seen a document from 1942 proving that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust not to occur, but that the document was now lost. Jäckel wrote that he had ""easily"" discovered the ""lost"" document, which the head of the Reich Chancellery, Hans Lammers wrote to the Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger that Hitler ordered him to put the ""Jewish Question"" on the ""back burner"" until after the war. Jäckel noted the document concerned was the result of a meeting between Lammers and Schlegelberger on 10 April 1942 concerning amendments to the divorce law concerning German Jews and Mischlinge. Jäckel noted that in 1942, there was a division of labour between the representatives of the Rechtsstaat (Law State) and the Polizeistaat (Police State) in Nazi Germany. Jäckel argued that for the representatives of the Rechtsstaat like the Ministry of Justice, the ""Final Solution"" was a bureaucratic process to deprive Jews of their civil rights and to isolate them, whereas for representatives of Polizeistaat like the SS, the ""Final Solution"" was genocide. Jäckel argued that Hitler's order to Lammers to tell Schlegelberger that to wait until after the war before concerning him about the ""impracticable"" details of the divorce laws between German Jews and ""Aryans"" was simply Hitler's way of putting Schlegelberger off. Jäckel ended his essay that the ""lost"" document in no way proved that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, and accused Irving of deceitfulness in claiming otherwise.

In 1980, Jäckel, together with Axel Kuhn, published Hitler: Sämtliche Aufzeichnungen 1905-1924, a collection of primary documents that record all of Hitler speeches and writings in the period from 1905-1924. Included in the book were every surviving letter, postcard, note and poem written by Hitler. In their opinion, the editors concluded, there was a real change in Hitler's personality in 1919, with his writings before that year having been relatively apolitical, and his writings starting in 1919 showing an increasing obsession with antisemitism. In April 1981, it was revealed that 16 of the six hundred documents published in Hitler: Sämtliche Aufzeichnungen 1905-1924 were forgeries.

The Historikerstreit
In the Historikerstreit (Historians' Dispute) of 1986-88, Jäckel was a prominent critic of Ernst Nolte, whose theory of Nazi crimes as a reaction to Soviet crimes was denounced as ahistorical by Jäckel under the grounds that Hitler held the Soviet Union in contempt and therefore could not have possibly felt threatened by the Soviets as Nolte suggested. Jäckel attacked Nolte's statement that Hitler had an especially vivid fear of the Soviet ""rat cage"" torture by arguing that Hitler's statement of 1 February 1943 to his generals about captured German officers going off to the ""rat cage"" clearly meant the Lubyanka prison, and this is not as Nolte was arguing to be interpreted literally. Jäckel went on to argue that Nolte had done nothing to establish what the remarks about the ""rat cage"" had to do with the Holocaust. Jäckel went on to accuse Nolte of engaging in a post hoc, ergo propter hoc argument to establish the ""causal nexus"" between Hitler's supposed fear of the ""rat cage"" torture, and the Holocaust. Jäckel wrote in a 1986 essay entitled ""The Impoverished Practice of Insinuation: The Singular Aspect of National-Socialist Crimes Cannot Be Denied"" first published in the Die Zeit newspaper on September 12, 1986 that

Hitler often said why he wished to remove and kill the Jews. His explanation is a complicated and structurally logical construct that can be reproduced in great detail. A rat cage, the murders committed by the Bolsheviks, or a special fear of these are not mentioned. On the contrary, Hitler was always convinced that Soviet Russia, precisely because it was ruled by Jews, was a defenseless colossus standing on clay feet. Aryans had no fear of Slavic or Jewish subhumans. The Jew, Hitler wrote in 1926 in Mein Kampf, ""is not an element of an organization, but a ferment of decomposition. The gigantic empire in the East is ripe for collapse."" Hitler still believed this in 1941 when he had his soldiers invade Russia without winter equipment.

Recently, Jäckel has modified his position. He now believes that most of the initiatives for the Holocaust came from Hitler, though it was more the result of a series of ad hoc decisions rather than a masterplan on the part of Hitler. In 1998, Jäckel argued that Hitler was able to begin the Holocaust in mid-1941 by playing Himmler against Heydrich. Jäckel argued that though Himmler was antisemitic, he was less enthusiastic about genocide than Heydrich, whereas the latter saw genocide as a way of obtaining Hitler's support for building a power base outside of Himmler's control. In Jäckel's view, antisemitism was a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the Holocaust under the grounds that people had been intensely antisemitic in Europe for centuries without genocide occurring. In contrast to the functionalists who have argued for the ""weak dictator"" thesis about Hitler's power, Jäckel has supported the ""master of the Third Reich"" thesis and has described Hitler's power as Alleinherrschaft (sole rule).

Uniqueness of the Holocaust
Against Nolte's claim that the Holocaust was not unique, but rather one of out many genocides, Jäckel rejected Nolte's view and those of his supporters like Joachim Fest by writing:

I, however claim (and not for the first time) that the National Socialist murder of the Jews was unique because never before had a nation with the authority of its leader decided and announced that it would kill off as completely as possible a particular group of humans, including old people, women, children and infants, and actually put this decision into practice, using all the means of governmental power at its disposal. This idea is so apparent and so well known that it is quite astonishing that it could have escaped Fest's attention (the massacres of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War were, according to all we know, more like murderous deportations than planned genocide).

Jäckel accused Nolte, Fest and Klaus Hildebrand of engaging in a ""game of confusion"". Jäckel wrote that the ""game of confusion"" comprised posing hypotheses disguised as questions without proof, and when one demands proof, there is an angry response that ""one is after all still allowed to ask!"". In response to Jäckel's attack, Nolte in an essay published in the Die Zeit newspaper on 31 October 1986 wrote that Jäckel's attack was something that one might expect in an East German newspaper and that:"" And I am amazed at the coldheartedness with which Eberhard Jäckel says that not every single bourgeois was killed."". During a debate in London in 1987 to consider the Historikerstreit, Fest and Jäckel again clashed over the question of the ""singularity"" of the Holocaust with Fest accusing Jäckel of presenting a ""caricature"" of his and Nolte's views.

The uniqueness and singularity of the Holocaust is a major theme of Jäckel's. In his view it is like no other genocide. In an essay published in Der Spiegel on 23 December 1991, Jäckel argued against those who claimed that the East German dictatorship was just as inhumane as the Nazi dictatorship. During the ""Goldhagen Controversy"" of 1996, Jäckel was a leading critic of Daniel Goldhagen, and wrote a very hostile book review in the Die Zeit newspaper in May 1996 that called Hitler's Willing Executioners ""simply a bad book"". The Canadian historian Fred Kautz in defence of Goldhagen wrote that: ""Jackel is not a ""structuralist"", but a Hitler biographer. He expounds the theory that Hitler alone was driven by the explicit desire to kill all the Jews and that in essence only he is guilty. This narrows down the question of guilt to only one evil person and absolves the ""ordinary Germans."".

Last years
The partnership with Lea Rosh begun in 1988 and led to a widely watched, four-part television documentary called Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland, a popular book of the same name, and the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis in 1990. With Lea, Jäckel also led the drive to create a memorial in Berlin to the murdered Jews of Europe. The  Holocaust-Mahnmal opened in 2005. 

On 33 March 2006 in a feuilleton (opinion) piece in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jäckel wrote a book review that approved of Guenter Lewy's thesis in his book The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey about the 1915 Armenian Massacres, that there were massacres, but no genocide of the Armenians. Jäckel's critics accused him of disregarding the fact that Turkish troops were crossing the border and exterminating Armenians outside the Ottoman Empire in 1918 (young-Turkish campaign in Caucasus killing 40,000 Armenians) and in 1920 (Kemalist troops killing 60,000 civilians).

318,50190837,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgije%20Brankovi%C4%87,Georgije Branković,"Georgije Branković (; 1830–1907) was the Patriarch of Karlovci, the spiritual leader of Habsburg Serbs, from 1890 until his death in 1907. He instigated a number of significant religious, educational, and economic reforms within  territories covered by the Patriarchate, and was a renowned patron of the arts.

Biography
A painting called Migration of the Serbs was commissioned by Patriarch Georgije for the 1896 Budapest Millennium Exhibition, marking a thousand years of the Hungarian Empire and reaffirming that country's territorial rights. Prompted by patriotism and contemporary politics, Patriarch Georgije convinced painter Paja Jovanović to present the case for the legitimacy of the Serbian historical presence and territorial claims and, as a consequence, contemporary acceptance of the ""legal and privileged position of the Serbs in the Austrian monarchy"". The Serbian understanding was that their migration was in response to Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor's request for their assistance in protecting his borders against the Turks. The contemporary message was that this was the genesis of the Serbian presence in the border areas now under Austria-Hungary.

It comprises most of section 32 on the northern base of Waterford Hill.

Formation
Moon Valley was formed during the retreat of the last continental glacier, approximately 14,000 years ago.  As they retreated, the glaciers left behind debris, called moraines, and valleys.  The retreating glaciers also formed numerous lakes.

History
In 1854, Stephen Moon (1823-1909) came to Independence Township, Michigan from Palmyra, New York and was the first to settled in a valley on the northern side of Waterford Hill along the Saginaw Trail (now Dixie Highway).  His tract of land was in section 32 of the township.  There he established a 120-acre stock farm where he raised sheep, hogs, cows and fowl. 

Moon's son, Melvin C. Moon (1854-1933), eventually took over ownership of the farm and ran it until 1910. 

The valley became known as ""Moon Valley"". 

The farm was subdivided and today consists of a residences on Maple Lane and a commercial district along Dixie Highway.

Geography
The Clinton River winds its way around Moon Valley and through Greens Lake, a 117 acres, 55 foot depth lake which borders the western side of the valley.

McAllister has worked closely with the firm of Zuckermann Harpsichords International (Stonington, Connecticut, US), and with Hubbard Harpsichords, including a month-long residency in 1989 at the firm's headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts. Since September 1986, he has carried out his craft from a studio within the Community Work Society Co-operative Ltd, alongside a group of heritage artisans in the Melbourne suburb of Preston. McAllister has worked closely with leading Australian and New Zealand harpsichordists as well as performers from Europe and the North America. These include Gustav Leonhardt, Ton Koopman, Bob van Asperen, Anthony Jennings, Peter Watchorn, Christopher Hogwood, Roger Heagney, Christiane Jaccotet, Colin Tilney, Davitt Moroney, and Bart van Oort. Since 1990, McAllister has served as the keyboard consultant to the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, and has built a two-manual French instrument for its artistic director, Paul Dyer. McAllister harpsichords are owned by such ensembles as The Sydney Consort, and harpsichordists Peter Watchorn, Paul Dyer, Elizabeth Anderson, and Roger Heagney.

McAllister has been at the forefront of harpsichord research and, with Andrew Bernard, proposed a unified theory of harpsichord scaling and geometry that accounts for the diverse pitches for which harpsichords were designed, linking this information to surviving string gauges and tuning forks. He was the first to demonstrate that stringing the early 20th century Pleyel harpsichord with classical wire and installing quill or delrin plectra yields a significant improvement in quality. In collaboration with Peter Watchorn, McAllister researched the surviving instruments by Hans Moermans ""The Younger"" of Antwerp, resulting in the creation of the first modern copies of his surviving 1642 double; one of these copies by McAllister is now owned by the Melbourne Recital Centre in the Southbank precinct.

In 2012, McAllister published three books; with Talking Harpsichords sharing his ruminations on a harpsichord-making career.

325,1768434,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life%20Is%20Killing%20Me,Life Is Killing Me,"Life Is Killing Me is the sixth studio album by gothic metal band Type O Negative. It was released on June 17, 2003, and was their final studio album released through record label Roadrunner Records.

The album's title and content refers primarily to frontman Peter Steele's dissatisfied life outlook and experiences with mental illness at the time of writing and production, with lyrics concerning relationship problems and the illness and death of his parents.

The album reached No. 39 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 27,000 copies in its first week, and received positive reviews from music critics, who noted a more melodic sound in comparison to previous records. ""I Don't Wanna Be Me"" was released as a promotional single, for which a music video was produced.

Recording 

Life Is Killing Me was recorded at Systems Two Recording Studio in Brooklyn, New York.

Vocalist and bassist Peter Steele used a custom Fernandes Tremor bass guitar for the recording of the album, an instrument which was built to his exact specifications under his sponsorship with the company.

This is the last album by the band to make use of programmed drums, which had previously been used on October Rust and World Coming Down; the band's next and final studio album, Dead Again, would feature only studio drums.

Content 

Describing the inspiration behind the title and theme of the record, Steele responded in an interview: ""I guess I am going through some sort of midlife crisis being 41 years old now. And all the things I took for granted, my health, my life, people I love dying, people I loved walking away. I was with a girlfriend for 10 years but she left. It is like my dreams are dead."" The album's title was originally going to be The Dream Is Dead.

The album contains a cover of the song ""Angry Inch"" from the off-Broadway musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch. The track ""Thir13teen"" is a cover of music featured in the TV show The Munsters.

Lyrical themes 

Billboard described the record's lyrical themes as ""infidelity, death and depression"".

""Todd's Ship Gods (Above All Things)"" was written by Steele about his father.

""I Like Goils"" is described by Steele as ""poking fun at PC"" (political correctness), with lyrics centred on Steele's frustration with having homosexual men make sexual advances towards him following his 1995 Playgirl photoshoot, which, at the time, Steele agreed to pose for unaware that women made up only a minority of the readership.

The album's title track further references Steele's father's death, while ""Nettie"" was written about his mother.

Musical style 

AllMusic wrote ""guitarist Kenny Hickey's passages have grown increasingly melodic, and the keys of Josh Silver possess a timeless melancholy"" despite ""how bleak or odd the lyrical proceedings get"". Loudwire described it as ""the most uplifting sounding album of their career"".

Release

Life Is Killing Me was leaked onto the internet before release, upsetting keyboard player Josh Silver to the point that he released a message online complaining that the leak essentially took revenue from the band. The album was officially released on June 17, 2003 on CD as well as cassette in some regions. In Europe, the album was also released with a bonus CD.

The album reached No. 39 on the US Billboard 200 chart.

The album was favorably received by music critics. Exclaim! wrote ""Life Is Killing Me pays tongue-in-cheek homage to the world and the women that have screwed Steele over so badly. But musically, the disc is pure pop-rock bliss.""

""(We Were) Electrocute"" was featured on the soundtrack to the 2003 horror film Freddy vs. Jason.

Legacy 

""I Don't Wanna Be Me"" was covered by European death metal band Meridian Dawn for their debut 2014 release The Mixtape. The song was later covered by Trivium.

The opening two seconds of guitar feedback and drum startup on ""I Don't Wanna Be Me"" is sampled and heard frequently on the Liberty Rock Radio station in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV.

326,478860,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilltop%20Youth,Hilltop Youth,"Hilltop Youth (, No'ar HaGva'ot) are hardline, extremist religious-nationalist youth who establish outposts without an Israeli legal basis in the West Bank. The ideology of the Hilltop Youth includes the claim that the Palestinians are ""raping the Holy Land"", and must be expelled. According to Ami Pedahzur, their work in establishing illegal outposts was not simply the result of individual initiatives, this was ""a myth cultivated by the Yesha Council"", and, in fact, forms part of a wider multi-faceted settler strategy. The term ""hilltop youth"" is regarded by Daniel Byman as a misnomer, since the movement was founded mostly by married people in their mid-twenties.

Origins
On 16 November 1998, in what was viewed as a declaration intended to thwart peace talks, and in particular the implementation of his political rival Benjamin Netanyahu's Wye River agreement with the Palestinian National Authority, the then-Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon urged settler youth to ""grab the hilltops"", adding, ""Everyone that's there should move, should run, should grab more hills, expand the territory. Everything that's grabbed will be in our hands. Everything we don't grab will be in their hands.""

People proceeded to heed his exhortation and outposts proliferated, in a practice often called ""creating facts on the ground"", but many would later feel betrayed by Sharon when the Israeli West Bank barrier he devised in 2005 cut off many of the illegal communities from the expanded Israel Sharon envisaged at that time.

The example of figures like Netanel Ozeri, who moved his family out of the safety of Kiryat Arba's perimeters to build an outpost, Hilltop 26, on nearby Palestinian land, was also important: Ozeri was later  shot dead by Palestinian gunmen.

Influences 
According to terrorism expert Ami Pedahzur, ideologically, hilltop youth espouse a Kahanist worldview, favouring ""deportation, revenge, and annihilation of Gentiles that posed a threat to the people of Israel"".

The youth are influenced by religious Zionist ideals, which include a dedication to building and farming the land, as well as devoting time to learning Torah. Many have studied in the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva under Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh, who developed the metaphor comparing Israel to a ""nut"" which had to be cracked in order to allow the fruit, the people, out. In addition to basing their ideals on the teachings of prominent rabbis such as Avraham Yitzchak Kook and Rabbi Shmuel Tal, some regard Avri Ran as a spiritual leader, or ""father"", of the movement, though he does not see himself as such. The philosophy of some in the movement is expressed by a mixture of distrust of the Israeli government and a desire to re-establish the Ancient Kingdom of Israel.

About the groups
The Hilltop Youth are a ""loosely organized, anarchy-minded group"", of some several hundred youths around a hard core of scores of  violent activists often noted for establishing illegal/disputed outposts outside existing settlements. According to Danny Rubinstein they are  formed into private militias. Their numbers (2009) are estimated to be around 800, with approximately 5,000 others who share their ideological outlook. They completely dissociate themselves from Israeli institutions, and identify themselves with the Land of Israel. They settle on hilltops in areas densely crowded by Palestinians. Members linked to the group have been accused of engaging in Israeli settler violence, including vandalism of Palestinian schools and mosques, the rustling of sheep from Palestinian flocks and the extirpation of their centuries-old olive groves, or stealing their olive harvests. This last practice was endorsed by Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu on a visit to a hilltop outpost, Havat Gilad, where he issued a rabbinical ruling that, ""The ground on which the trees are planted is the inheritance of the Jewish people, and the fruit of the plantings was seeded by the goyim in land that is not theirs."" They seize land not by any official method: they claim a hilltop by setting up an encampment, and then claim the land nearby, whether under Palestinian cultivation or not, or by uprooting Palestinian trees and shooting in the air if any Palestinian comes near to the new outpost.

Settlers have long been accused of carrying out what are called ""price tag attacks"", a term used for targeting Palestinian property in revenge for outposts demolished by the Israeli military, although no one as yet has actually been convicted of having been involved in such vandalism.

Many of the Hilltop Youth feel that the mainstream settler movement has lost its way, opting for cheap housing close to major cities, built by local Arab labor, with tall fences and no space between their homes. The Youth often engage in organic farming and shun Palestinian labor in favor of Hebrew labor. 2.5% of eggs consumed in Israel are calculated to be produced on the outposts run by the Hilltop Youth leader Avri Ran. 

The Hilltop Youth has been condemned in the past by figures within Israel's government, with Former Defense Minister Ehud Barak referring to the group as unacceptable ""homemade terror, Jewish-made terror"".

Parallel with ISIS
According to Hillel Gershuni, there is a deep connection between the outlook of Hilltop Youth and that of the militants of ISIS. Both are anti-state movements, and the Hilltop Youth are dedicated to the destruction of all of Israel's institutions. Like ISIS, the appeal is to a fundamentalist vision that endows those who join the group with a sense of authenticity in revolt. They advocate retaliation against non-Jews and the use of terror in order to establish a ""pure form of Jewish existence"". They believe their acts form part of a process of geula, or national redemption. Key differences include that they only have a few dozen violent members, unlike ISIS which is a mass movement, and they do not believe that the Jewish religion should be spread by the sword.

Notable exponents

Meir Ettinger (born 4 October 1991), the son of Tova Kahane (daughter of Meir Kahane) and Mordechai Ettinger, a rabbi at the Jerusalem yeshivot of Har Hamor and Ateret Cohanim. He previously resided at Ramat Migron outpost, and later the Givat Ronen outpost near Har Brakha, was subsequently deported, by administrative order, from the West Bank and Jerusalem, taking up residence with his family in Safed. He has attracted many followers and in addition to public speaking, he has published a blog at the pro-Hilltop Youth website ""The Jewish Voice"" (Hebrew: הקול היהודי). He was arrested for the ""spy affair"", when settler youths were accused of maintaining an ""operation room"" to monitor IDF movements and warn outpost settlers of impending evacuations. After violating his house arrest terms, he was held in jail until the end of his trial, in which he was convicted following a plea-bargain for conspiring to gather military intelligence and sentenced to time served, approximately 6 months.  In August 2015, following the arson at the Church of the Multiplication in June and the Duma arson attack, he was placed under administrative arrest for 6 months, which was extended by an additional 4 months. During his incarceration, he staged a hunger strike. In June 2016, following his release, he returned to reside in Safed, and is barred by administrative order from entering the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Yad Binyamin. In addition, he is forbidden, by administrative order, from contacting 92 people.

328,1807899,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caernarfon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29,Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency),"Caernarfon was a parliamentary constituency centred on the town of Caernarfon in Wales. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system.

The constituency was created in 1536 as a District of Boroughs, represented in the House of Commons of England until 1707, in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800, and in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1950.  The District of Boroughs was abolished in 1950, and replaced with a county constituency of the same name, which was itself abolished in 2010.

History
Known as Carnarvon until 1832, and then as the Carnarvon Boroughs or Carnarvon District of Boroughs from 1832 to 1950 and as Caernarvon from 1950 to 1983, it is named after Caernarfon, the main town within the constituency. Its most famous member was David Lloyd George, who was MP for 55 years. When Lloyd George became prime minister in 1916 it became the first Welsh constituency to be represented by a serving prime minister.
Plaid Cymru held the seat continuously from 1974 until its abolition in 2010, longer than they have held any other seat.

Boundaries 
The constituency names, in this section, follow the format and the spelling used by F. W. S. Craig in his British Parliamentary Election Results series. Variations may be found in other sources.

Caernarvon 1536–1832 
On the basis of information from several volumes of the History of Parliament, it is apparent that the history of the borough representation from Wales and Monmouthshire is more complicated than that of the English boroughs.

The Laws in Wales Act 1535 (26 Hen. VIII, c. 26) provided for a single borough seat for each of 11 of the 12 Welsh counties and Monmouthshire. The legislation, which was passed in 1536 (using the modern civil year starting on 1 January), was ambiguous as to which communities were enfranchised. The county towns were awarded a seat, but this in some fashion represented all the ancient boroughs of the county, as the others were required to contribute to the member's wages. It is not clear if the burgesses of the contributing boroughs could vote. The only election under the original scheme was for the 1542 Parliament. It seems that only burgesses from the county towns actually took part. An Act of 1544 (35 Hen. VIII, c. 11) confirmed that the contributing boroughs could send representatives to take part in the election at the county town. As far as can be told from surviving indentures of returns, the degree to which the out boroughs participated varied, but by the end of the 16th century all the seats had some participation from them at some elections at least.

The original scheme was modified by later legislation and decisions of the House of Commons, which were sometimes made with no regard to precedent or evidence: for example in 1728 it was decided that only the freemen of the borough of Montgomery could participate in the election for that seat, thus disenfranchising the freemen of Llanidloes, Welshpool and Llanfyllin.

In the case of Caernarvonshire (now Caernarfonshire), the county town was Caernarvon (now known as Caernarfon). The out boroughs were Conway (now Conwy), Criccieth (or Cricieth), Nevin (now known as Nefyn), and Pwllheli. The freemen of the five boroughs were entitled to vote. In the 1715–1754 period there were estimated to be about 1,600 freemen, of whom about 1,200 were non-resident. Later in the 18th century the estimated electorate was about 1,000 freemen.

Caernarvon Boroughs 1832–1950 

The Caernarvon Boroughs was a district of boroughs constituency, which grouped a number of parliamentary boroughs in Caernarvonshire into one single member constituency. The voters in each participating borough cast ballots, which were added together over the whole district to decide the result of the poll. The enfranchised communities in this district, from 1832, were the six boroughs of Caernarvon, Bangor, Conway, Criccieth, Nevin, and Pwllheli.

The exact boundaries of the parliamentary boroughs in the district were altered by the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1868, but the general nature of the constituency was unchanged. There were no further boundary changes in the 1885 redistribution of parliamentary seats.

In 1918 the constituency was redefined, to include the then local government areas of the Municipal Boroughs of Bangor, Caernarvon, Conway, and Pwllheli; the Urban Districts of Criccieth, Llandudno, Llanfairfechan and Penmaenmawr, as well as the Lleyn Rural District.

From 1918 to 1950 the administrative county of Caernarvonshire was divided into two seats: Caernarvon Boroughs and a Caernarvonshire county constituency. The territory of the borough seat was enclaved within the county constituency. Different local authorities, included in the borough constituency, were not necessarily adjoining.

Caernarvon 1950–1983 
The redistribution, which took effect in 1950, created two Caernarvonshire county divisions – Caernarvon  in the south-western two thirds of the county and Conway (later spelt Conwy) in the north-eastern third. The new divisions included territory which had come from both of the two old seats.

The local authorities, whose territories were combined to form the constituency in 1950, were the Municipal Boroughs of Caernarvon, and Pwllheli; the Urban Districts of Criccieth, and Portmadoc; as well as the Rural Districts of Gwyrfai and Lleyn. This arrangement was not altered by the redistribution which took effect in February 1974, which was based on the pre-1974 local government boundaries.

From 1 April 1974, a new pattern of counties was created in Wales. This constituency became part of the county of Gwynedd.

Caernarfon from 1983 
In the redistribution of 1983, the spelling of the official name of the constituency was changed. The constituency boundary was unchanged, but it was redefined in terms of the local authorities created in 1974. It comprised the Borough of Arfon wards numbered 8 to 12 and 16 to 29, together with the District of Dwyfor.

In 1996 Welsh local government was again reorganised. Arfon and Dwyfor became part of a Gwynedd unitary authority.

The Parliamentary Constituencies (Wales) Order 1995, based on the pre-1996 local authority areas, came into effect in 1997. It defined this constituency as:-

(i) The following wards of the Borough of Arfon, namely, Bethel, Bontnewydd, Cadnant, Deiniolen, Llanberis, Llandwrog, Llanllyfni, Llanrug, Llanwnda, Menai (Caernarfon), Peb-lig, Penisarwaun, Penygroes, Seiont, Talysarn, Waunfawr and Y Felinheli; and

(ii) the District of Dwyfor.

Following radical boundary changes undertaken by the Boundary Commission for Wales, this seat was abolished in time for the general election in 2010, replaced by Arfon and part of Dwyfor Meirionnydd.

 On petition, the election of Paget was declared void and Nanney was declared elected. The returning officer had included votes at Pwllheli which were not eligible, and these were deducted, leading to Nanney receiving 353 votes and Paget 343 votes. On a further petition, Paget was declared elected instead of Nanney.

334,55711,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%E2%80%93Gorman%20Tariff%20Act,Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act,"The Revenue Act or Wilson-Gorman Tariff of 1894 (ch. 349, §73, , August 27, 1894) slightly reduced the  United States tariff rates from the numbers set in the 1890 McKinley tariff and imposed a 2% tax on income over $4,000. It is named for William L. Wilson, Representative from West Virginia, chair of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Arthur P. Gorman of Maryland, both Democrats.

Supported by pro-free trade members of the Democratic Party, this attempt at tariff reform imposed the first peacetime income tax (2% on income over $4,000, or $88,100 in 2010 dollars, which meant fewer than 1% of households would pay any). The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions. The democrats under the Cleveland administration wanted to move away from the protectionism proposed by the McKinley tariff while Cleveland was still in office. By coincidence, $4,000 ($88,100 in 2010 dollars) would be the exemption for married couples when the Revenue Act of (October) 1913 was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson, as a result of the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in February 1913.

The bill introduced by Wilson and passed by the House significantly lowered tariff rates, in accordance with Democratic platform promises, and dropped the tariff to zero on iron ore, coal, lumber and wool, which angered American producers.  With Senator Gorman operating behind the scenes, protectionists in the Senate added more than 600 amendments that nullified most of the reforms and raised rates again.  The ""Sugar Trust"" in particular made changes that favored itself at the expense of the consumer.

President Grover Cleveland, who had campaigned on lowering the tariff and supported Wilson's version of the bill, was devastated that his program had been ruined.  He denounced the revised measure as a disgraceful product of ""party perfidy and party dishonor,"" but still allowed it to become law without his signature, believing that it was better than nothing and was at the least an improvement over the McKinley tariff.

The Wilson-Gorman Tariff attracted much opposition in West Texas, where sheepraisers opposed the measure. A Republican, George H. Noonan, was elected to Congress from the district stretching from San Angelo to San Antonio but only for a single term. Among Noonan's backers was a former slave, George B. Jackson, a businessman in San Angelo often called ""the wealthiest black man in Texas"" in the late 19th century.

The New York Times reported that many Democrats in the East ""prefer to take the income tax, odious as it is, and unpopular as it is bound to be with their constituents"" to defeating the Wilson tariff bill. Democratic Representative Johnson of Ohio supported the income tax as the lesser of two evils:
""he was for an income tax as against a tariff tax; but he believed, that it was un-Democratic, inquisitorial, and wrong in principle.""

Legacy
The income tax provision was struck down in 1895 by the U.S. Supreme Court case Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., .  In 1913, the 16th Amendment permitted a federal income tax.

The tariff provisions of Wilson-Gorman were superseded by the Dingley Tariff of 1897.

337,1343352,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben%20Hur%20%282003%20film%29,Ben Hur (2003 film),"Ben Hur is a 2003 American-Canadian animated drama film based on the 1880 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, by Lew Wallace. It is the fourth film adaptation of the novel.

Charlton Heston's production company, Agamemnon Films (in association with GoodTimes Entertainment), produced this direct-to-video animated version of the story, with Heston himself reprising his role as the title character. It would prove to be his final film role before his death in 2008.

Synopsis
The animated version tells the same story as the 1959 film, with some differences. The story begins with Balthazar waiting in the desert for the two other wise men for a journey to Bethlehem. The story of Ben-Hur begins 30 years after the birth of Christ.

In contrast to the 1925 and 1959 versions, the face of Jesus is shown and his words are heard in this film.

The character of Messala is different from the 1959 film. Appearing lame, he approaches Ben-Hur for forgiveness, and joins Ben-Hur's family and Balthazar to witness the passion of Jesus. Ben-Hur gives water to Jesus on the way to Calvary. As Jesus dies, Ben-Hur and his family, with Balthazar, Messala, and  Esther, clasp their hands in prayer. Miracles occur when Jesus heals Ben-Hur's family of leprosy, and enables Messala to walk again. He comes near the cross thanking Jesus for the miracle.

At the film's end, Mary Magdalene sees Jesus emerge from the tomb and he ascends into heaven, giving the promise to the apostles to preach the gospel. Ben-Hur, now married to Esther, shares with his children his story and faith in Jesus.

338,25439732,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice,Juice,"Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice. Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, as for smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine production). The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increases with country income level.

Etymology

The word ""juice"" comes from Old French in about 1300; it developed from the Old French words ""jus, juis, jouis"", which mean ""liquid obtained by boiling herbs"". The ""Old French jus ""juice, sap, liquid"" (13c.)...[came] from Latin ius [which means] ""broth, sauce, juice, soup,"" from PIE root *yeue- ""to blend, mix food"" (cognates: Sanskrit yus- ""broth,"" Greek zyme ""a leaven"", Old Church Slavonic jucha ""broth, soup,""  ""ukha"",  ""fish soup"")."" The use of the word ""juice"" to mean ""the watery part of fruits or vegetables"" was first recorded in the early 14th century. Since the 19th century, the term ""juice"" has also been used in a figurative sense (e.g., to mean alcohol or electricity). Today, ""au jus"" refers to meat served along with its own juice, commonly as a gravy.

Preparation

Juice is prepared by mechanically squeezing or macerating (sometimes referred to as cold pressed) fruit or vegetable flesh without the application of heat or solvents. For example, orange juice is the liquid extract of the fruit of the orange tree, and tomato juice is the liquid that results from pressing the fruit of the tomato plant. Juice may be prepared in the home from fresh fruit and vegetables using a variety of hand or electric juicers. Many commercial juices are filtered to remove fiber or pulp, but high-pulp fresh orange juice is a popular beverage. Additives are put in some juices, such as sugar and artificial flavours (in some fruit juice-based beverages); savoury seasonings (e.g., in Clamato or Caesar tomato juice drinks). Common methods for preservation and processing of fruit juices include canning, pasteurization, concentrating, freezing, evaporation and spray drying.

Although processing methods vary between juices, the general processing method of juices includes:
 Washing and sorting food source
 Juice extraction
 Straining, filtration and clarification
 Blending pasteurization
 Filling, sealing and sterilization
 Cooling, labeling and packing

After the fruits are picked and washed, the juice is extracted by one of two automated methods. In the first method, two metal cups with sharp metal tubes on the bottom cup come together, removing the peel and forcing the flesh of the fruit through the metal tube. The juice of the fruit, then escapes through small holes in the tube. The peels can then be used further, and are washed to remove oils, which are reclaimed later for usage. The second method requires the fruits to be cut in half before being subjected to reamers, which extract the juice.

After the juice is filtered, it may be concentrated in evaporators, which reduce the size of juice by a factor of 5, making it easier to transport and increasing its expiration date. Juices are concentrated by heating under a vacuum to remove water, and then cooling to around 13 degrees Celsius. About two thirds of the water in a juice is removed. The juice is then later reconstituted, in which the concentrate is mixed with water and other factors to return any lost flavor from the concentrating process. Juices can also be sold in a concentrated state, in which the consumer adds water to the concentrated juice as preparation. 

Juices are then pasteurized and filled into containers, often while still hot. If the juice is poured into a container while hot, it is cooled as quickly as possible. Packages that cannot stand heat require sterile conditions for filling. Chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide can be used to sterilize containers.  Plants can make anywhere from 1 to 20 tonnes a day.

Processing

High intensity pulsed electric fields are being used as an alternative to heat pasteurization in fruit juices. Heat treatments sometimes fail to make a quality, microbiological stable product. However, it was found that processing with high intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF) can be applied to fruit juices to provide a shelf-stable and safe product. In addition, it was found that pulsed electric fields provide a fresh-like and high nutrition value product. Pulsed electric field processing is a type of nonthermal method for food preservation.

Pulsed electric fields use short pulses of electricity to inactivate microbes. In addition, the use of PEF results in minimal detrimental effects on the quality of the food. Pulse electric fields kill microorganisms and provide better maintenance of the original colour, flavour, and nutritional value of the food as compared to heat treatments. This method of preservation works by placing two electrodes between liquid juices then applying high voltage pulses for microseconds to milliseconds.The high voltage pulses are of intensity in the range of 10 to 80 kV/cm.

Processing time of the juice is calculated by multiplying the number of pulses with the effective pulse duration. The high voltage of the pulses produce an electric field that results in microbial inactivation that may be present in the juice. The PEF temperatures are below that of the temperatures used in thermal processing. After the high voltage treatment, the juice is aseptically packaged and refrigerated. Juice is also able to transfer electricity due to the presence of several ions from the processing. When the electric field is applied to the juice, electric currents are then able to flow into the liquid juice and transferred around due to the charged molecules in the juice. Therefore, pulsed electric fields are able to inactivate microorganisms, extend shelf life, and reduce enzymatic activity of the juice while maintaining similar quality as the original, fresh pressed juice.

Terminology

In the United Kingdom, the name or names of the fruit followed by juice can only legally be used to describe a product which is 100% fruit juice, as required by the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations and the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (Scotland) Regulations 2003. However, a juice made by reconstituting concentrate can be called juice. A product described as fruit ""nectar"" must contain at least 25% to 50% juice, depending on the fruit. A juice or nectar including concentrate must state that it does. The term ""juice drink"" is not defined in the Regulations and can be used to describe any drink which includes juice, whatever the amount. Comparable rules apply in all EU member states in their respective languages.

In the US, fruit juice can only legally be used to describe a product which is 100% fruit juice. A blend of fruit juice(s) with other ingredients, such as high-fructose corn syrup, is called a juice cocktail or juice drink. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the term ""nectar"" is generally accepted in the US and in international trade for a diluted juice to denote a beverage that contains fruit juice or puree, water, and artificial sweeteners. ""No added sugar"" is commonly printed on labels of juice containers, but the products may contain large amounts of naturally occurring sugars; however, sugar content is listed with other carbohydrates on labels in many countries.

Depending on trends and regulations, beverages listed as 100% juice may actually contain unlisted additives. For example, most orange juice contains added ethyl butyrate (to enhance flavor), vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), and water (if from concentrate). When fruit juice is too sour, acidic, or rich to consume, it may be diluted with water and sugar to create an -ade (such as lemonade, limeade, cherryade, and orangeade). The 'ade' suffix may also refer to any sweetened, fruit-flavored drink, whether or not it actually contains any juice.

Health effects

Juices are often consumed for their perceived health benefits. For example, orange juice with natural or added vitamin C, folic acid, and potassium. Juice provides nutrients such as carotenoids, polyphenols and vitamin  C that offer health benefits.

High consumption of fruit juice with added sugar may be linked to weight gain, but not all studies have shown this effect. If 100% from fruit, juice can help meet daily intake recommendations for some nutrients.

100% fruit juice

Research suggests that 100% fruit juice is not associated with increased risk of diabetes. A 2018 review concluded that 100% fruit juice increases the risk of tooth decay in children but there is ""no conclusive evidence that consumption of 100% fruit juice has adverse health effects.""

Cranberry juice
Although preliminary research indicated that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of urinary tract infections in women with frequent infections, a more substantial Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to indicate that cranberry juice consumption has any effect on urinary tract infections. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30% of people.

Negative effects
The American Academy of Pediatrics as of 2017 says that fruit juice should not be given to children under age one due to the lack of nutritional benefit. For children ages one to six, intake of fruit juice should be limited to less than  per day (about a half to three-quarters of a cup) due to its high sugar and low fiber content compared to fruit. Overconsumption of fruit juices may reduce nutrient intake compared to eating whole fruits, and may produce diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, bloating, or tooth decay.

Overconsumption of fruits and fruit juice may contribute to dental decay and cavities via the effect of fruit acids on tooth enamel. Longitudinal prospective cohort studies showed a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes when juices with added sugars were consumed compared to eating whole fruits. A 2014 review found that higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice was significantly associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. 

Overconsumption of fruit juice with added sugars has also been linked to childhood obesity. The American Journal of Public Health proposed that the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 in the United States eliminate 100% fruit juices and substitute instead with whole fruits.

Amount consumed
The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increased with country income level.

In 2007, a report stated that fruit juice consumption overall in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the US has increased in recent years.

In 2015, people in the United States consumed approximately 6.6 US gallons of juices per capita with more than half of preschool-age children being regular drinkers.

Juice bars

A juice bar is an establishment that primarily serves prepared juice beverages such as freshly squeezed or extracted fruit juices, juice blends, fruit smoothies (a thick fruit drink, often iced), or other juices such as fresh wheatgrass juice. Sometimes other solid ingredients or nutritional supplements may be added as boosters, such as fresh bananas, nuts or nut butter, bodybuilding supplements, soy protein powder or others such as whey or hemp protein powders, wheat germ, or spirulina or chlorella. Also if less juice is used with these same ingredients drinks called health shakes may be produced.

Juice bars share some of the characteristics of a coffeehouse, a soda fountain, a café, and a snack bar, such as providing blended drinks and food, such as sandwiches. Juice bars may be standalone businesses in cities or located at gyms, along commuter areas, near lunchtime areas, at beaches, and at tourist attractions. In Mexico, juice bars have become more popular in the 2000s. Mexican juice bars often also sell healthy beverages and snacks.

History
Groups of grape pits dated to 8000 BCE show early evidence of juice production; although it is thought that the grapes may have been alternatively used to produce wine. One of the first regularly produced juices was lemonade, appearing in 16th-century Italy, as an import, after its conception in the Middle East. Orange juice originated in the 17th century. In the 18th century, James Lind linked citrus fruits to the prevention of scurvy, which, a century later, led to the implementation of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1867, requiring all ocean-bound British ships to carry citrus-based juice on board.

In 1869, a dentist by the name of Thomas B. Welch developed a pasteurization method that allowed for the storage of juice, without the juice fermenting into alcohol. His method involved filtering squeezed grape juice into bottles, sealing them with cork and wax, and then placing them in boiling water. This method kills the yeast responsible for fermentation. He then sold his new product as ""Dr Welch's Unfermented Wine"". In the late 18th-century United States, circulation of foreign fruit juices were heavily regulated by tariffs. The McKinley Tariff Act of 1890 increased import taxes from 38 to 49.5 percent, and set taxes on fruit juices based on the alcohol content of the drink. Juices with 18% or less alcohol were taxed 60 cents per gallon, while anything above 18% was taxed US$2.50 per proof gallon.

Figurative uses
The use of the word ""juice"" to mean ""liquor"" (alcohol) is from 1828. The use of the term ""juice"" to mean ""electricity"" dates from 1896. As a verb, the word ""juice"" was first recorded as meaning ""to enliven"" in 1964. The adjective ""juiced"" is recorded as meaning ""drunk"" in 1946 and in 2003 ""enhanced or as if enhanced by steroids"". The adjective ""juicy"" has meant ""succulent"" since the 15th century (e.g., a juicy roast beef). The figurative meaning ""wealthy, full of some desired quality"" dates from the 1620s (e.g., a pirate calling a heavily laden ship he aims to plunder a ""juicy catch""). The meaning ""lively, suggestive, racy, sensational"" (e.g., a juicy scandal) is from 1883.

340,335100,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20Star%20Wars%20weapons,List of Star Wars weapons,"The following is a list of weapons shown in the Star Wars universe.

By type

Directed-energy weapons

Directed-energy weapons (DEW) figure prominently in the Star Wars franchise, with the most common type referred to as lasers or blasters. The in-universe description for how these weapons function is that a high-energy gas is charged by a power cell and converted into plasma, which is fired as a coherent energy bolt at the enemy via magnetic bottle effect. Small-arms blasters come in many types, from pistols to rifles, with accuracy and range improving as barrel length increases. Blaster cannons and laser cannons are more powerful types of these weapons commonly found on Star Wars vehicles, starfighters and other spacecraft, with laser cannons generally considered superior of the two. The most powerful type of these weapons are referred to as turbolasers, commonly found on Star Wars capital ships. Turbolasers require large crews and power generators to function but are effective against other capital ships and planetary targets.

Another common type of DEW in the Star Wars universe is the ion cannon, which background literature describes as firing powerful bolts of ionized energy designed to overload electrical systems or fuse mechanical components, disabling a target without causing lasting damage. Jawas use scrap-built ionization blasters to disable droids as seen in A New Hope. The v-150 Planet Defender which appears in The Empire Strikes Back defends the Rebel base on Hoth. A surface-based ion cannon designed to ward off orbiting starships, the v-150 is described as having a maximum range of  and is powerful enough to disrupt an Imperial Star Destroyer with a single bolt.

A unique type of DEW appearing in Star Wars films and other media are sonic weapons. Such weapons are commonly used by bounty hunters as a way to incapacitate their prey according to background material. It also refers to Geonosians specifically as being well-known within the setting for their sonic weaponry. First appearing in Attack of the Clones, Geonosian sonic weapons are described as using oscillators to create powerful sonic blasts which are enveloped in plasma-containment spheres and fired at the enemy.

Projectile weapons 
Projectile weapons, also referred to as slugthrowers, appear in the Star Wars universe in various forms. Reference material identifies the Tusken Raiders as using a type of slugthrower called a cycler rifle, built from stolen and scavenged parts and firing a solid shot enveloped in energy. The bounty hunter Aurra Sing is also identified as wielding an Adventurer slugthrower rifle, which is described as flooding the firing chamber with a rich oxidizer as it detonates its shell to give the projectile extra range and power.

The bowcaster is a crossbow-like weapon carried by Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew/Joonas Suotamo) during the events of the Star Wars films. Canonically, bowcasters were developed by the Wookiees and were a favorite weapon of theirs; other races were generally not strong enough to operate the cocking mechanism. Their function is described in reference material as firing a metal bolt called a quarrel. Alternating polarizer orbs on either end of the bow create a magnetic field which propels the quarrel forward, emerging from the barrel enveloped in blaster energy to give it an explosive impact.

Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) carries a custom-built bowcaster in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Identified as a lightbow, the weapon operates on the same principle as a Wookie bowcaster and is said to be more powerful than a heavy blaster rifle, allowing Chirrut to shoot down a TIE fighter during the events of the film.

Rockets and missiles 

The usage of rockets and missiles is seen frequently throughout the Star Wars franchise, including in films, comics, and novels. Within the Star Wars universe, these weapons are seen as complementary to energy weapons thanks to their ability to go around obstacles to hit targets, including those hiding behind the horizon, and to be fitted with a variety of mission-specific warheads, including antimatter, electromagnetic pulse, and hard radiation. However unlike a blaster bolt a missile can be shot down and is more easily dodged. The use of inertial compensators and tensor fields allow Star Wars missiles to withstand turning accelerations of up to 10,000 G without damaging their components.

In the original Star Wars movie, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) destroys the Death Star by firing a pair of proton torpedoes into its exhaust port. Proton torpedoes are described in background literature as missile weapons which can be fired at long-range targets and, upon impact, release clouds of high-velocity protons to damage the enemy. These weapons can display incredible maneuverability, such as making a 90-degree turn within a turning circle of one meter.

Another type of missile weapon are concussion missiles, such as those seen in Return of the Jedi when Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) pilots the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star II and destroys its reactor with a pair of concussion missiles. Concussion missiles are said to be primarily used for atmospheric combat, where their explosions create devastating sonic booms and ground tremors that can cause tremendous devastation. However their warheads are still powerful enough that they are effective when used in space combat.

Not all missile weapons in the Star Wars universe carry explosive warheads. The discord missile is a type described by in-universe material as agile enough to avoid anti-missile fire and deploy up to seven buzz droids on a target vessel. These droids then use their mechanical arms and cutting tools to inflict as much damage on the vessel as possible. Discord missiles were first seen in Revenge of the Sith during the opening space battle as a group of missile-deployed buzz droids attack Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) in his Jedi interceptor.

Many individual characters are seen or described as using rockets and missiles in the Star Wars universe. The bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) wears a jet pack which can fire an anti-vehicle homing missile, which he uses against Obi-Wan Kenobi in their duel on Kamino in Attack of the Clones. Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) also wears a jet pack which can fire either a homing missile or grappling hook, and carries a wrist-mounted mini concussion rocket launcher which can fire a variety of small homing rockets.

Other explosive devices 
Hand-held explosive devices are commonly seen and mentioned in the Star Wars saga and other media. Many hold a large amount of explosive power in a small package and can be triggered in a variety of ways, such as remotely or via timed fuse. Examples include concussion disks, EMP grenades, and thermal detonators. In Return of the Jedi, a disguised Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) threatens Jabba the Hutt with a Class-A thermal detonator. Star Wars fiction describes these devices as filled with a volatile baradium core surrounded by a thermite shell and capable of disintegrating anything within a  blast radius.

Another example of unique explosive devices are the Gungan weapons that feature in the climactic battle of The Phantom Menace and are referred to in Star Wars literature as ""boomas."" It describes these grenade-type weapons as containing plasmic energy which is mined from deep in the porous crust of Naboo and contained within protective shells. Upon impact these shells burst, releasing the plasma and a powerful electric shock on the target. These weapons come in multiple sizes, from handheld types that can be thrown to larger artillery shells launched by catapults and powerful enough to disable an armored tank.

Larger explosive devices include the seismic charges seen on film in Attack of the Clones, where Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) deploys them in an attempt to destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and prevent him from pursuing him. According to the Star Wars Databank, these weapons draw in sound and explode in devastating concussive waves of energy. Another is the electro-proton bomb which made its first appearance in the 2008 Clone Wars television series. Deployed on the planet Malastare, the bomb disabled an entire droid army in one blast but also awakened a slumbering Zillo Beast.

Melee 
The Star Wars universe also makes extensive use of melee weapons, such as staffs, swords, batons and whips. The most notable of those is the Lightsaber. The presence of those types of weapons allows for dramatic combat sequences such as lightsaber combat.

A Gaffii Stick or Gaderiffi is a staff weapon with a heavy end which appears similar to the medieval flanged mace. These weapons are described in background material as being hand-crafted by Tusken Raiders using a variety of materials, though with a preference for durable metals. They can be wielded a number of different ways to kill an opponent, or to incapacitate them when coated with the paralyzing venom of the fictional sandbat creature native to Tatooine.

An electrostaff is a melee weapon which is designed to withstand lightsaber strikes. According to reference literature, they accomplish this task thanks to the fictional material Phrik, a rare and virtually indestructible alloy which conducts energy. Either end of the staff features electromagnetic modules which, when activated, are sheathed in energy tendrils and deliver debilitating electrical charges that can be adjusted to lethal levels. These weapons made their first theatrical appearance in Revenge of the Sith being used by General Grievous's bodyguards, the IG-100 MagnaGuards, and have featured in other Star Wars media.

Similar to the electrostaff is the Z6 riot control baton, which made its theatrical appearance in The Force Awakens and is utilized by the First Order's stormtroopers to quell riots. Collapsible conductor contact veins are capable of delivering a powerful electric shock to incapacitate an opponent and can deflect a lightsaber blade. Reference literature also states the baton's adhesive grip pairs magnatomically with a stormtrooper's gloves.

Other types of melee weapons have featured in Star Wars Legends continuity. The amphistaff is the primary anti-personnel living weapon of the Yuuzhan Vong. Amphistaff scales can produce an edge harder than a diamond's that can stop a lightsaber. In addition to its default staff/spear configuration, an amphistaff can be wielded as a whip or flail by selectively hardening parts of its body.

Vibroweapons are a highly lethal class of melee weapon that utilises a generator, usually located on the weapon's hilt, to create supersonic vibrations. Many variations of vibroweapon exist; due to the adaptable nature of vibroweapon generators, vibroweapons can be made out of axes, pikes, knives, and swords. At least as far back as 3956 BBY, vibroweapons have often been laced with Cortosis (a rare metal known to short out lightsabers). This allows the user of the vibroblade to defend themself against a lightsaber wielding opponent. Vibroweapons have been used by characters in various media, such as Lando Calrissian from the Star Wars movies and Mission Vao from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The Emperor's Imperial guards, as seen in Return of the Jedi, use Force Pikes. These not only have a vibrating power tip, but can be set to deliver an electric stun charge. In order to allow this conductivity, the shaft of the force pike is made of reinforced graphite. Not only does this allow the pike to flex to absorb impact rather than breaking, but also means the weapon weighs no more than 7 kg and can therefore be handled with extreme swiftness and agility for a weapon of its length.

Lightsabers

Lightsabers (also known as laser swords or rens) are described as one of the most rare and mysterious weapons of the Star Wars universe and are generally used by the Jedi, the Sith, and the Knights of Ren, with Mandalorian rulers wielding the darksaber. The standard lightsaber is a sword-like weapon that emits a blade of pure energy from its metal hilt which has no mass but can cut through almost anything and deflect blaster bolts. The core of the lightsaber is a kyber crystal, which according to Star Wars canon acts as the focusing element and takes on a specific color when it ""bonds"" with someone sensitive to the Force. Variations on the standard design include double-bladed lightsabers like the one wielded by Maul (Ray Park) in The Phantom Menace.

In June 1572, Jane West married Thomas Wenman (died 1577), son of Sir Richard Wenman, by whom she had three sons, Richard Wenman, 1st Viscount Wenman, Ferdinand Wenman and Sir Thomas Wenman, and a daughter, Elizabeth Wenman, who married Sir Thomas Tredway.

Her second husband was James Cressy of Wilton, Buckinghamshire. They had a daughter, Lettice Cressy, who married Sir John Tasburgh of Flixton.

In January 1588 she married Thomas Tasburgh (died 1602) of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire. Her fourth husband was Ralph Sheldon (died 1613) of Beoley, Worcestershire.

Her portrait, (known as ""Mrs Ralph Sheldon""), was painted around the year 1593 by an unknown artist. Her costume jewels are carefully depicted, including rope of pearls, and a large sculptural jewel of enamelled gold with Orpheus and his lute surrounded by animals. Her velvet girdle is set with pearls or knots of pearls, with a table diamond set in gold with a pendant pearl at the front. Elizabeth I owned a similar ""waist girdle"" in 1587.

A soundtrack album, White Rock was released by Rick Wakeman in 1977 and it entered the UK Albums Chart on 12 February 1977, where it spent 9 weeks and reached number 14.

Production and release
Michael Samuelson was given the chance to make the 1976 Winter Olympics film, and he contacted Tony Maylam to direct and write the film. However, they felt that only two films had ""worked"". Olympia by Leni Riefenstahl of the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin and the Kon Ichikawa film Tokyo Olympiad of the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo. They decided that they did not want the film to be a documentary, but a feature film.

Tony Maylam made two music movies White Rock and Genesis: In Concert, also known as the Genesis Concert Movie, which is a movie shot in concert at The Apollo Theatre, Glasgow and the New Bingley Hall, Stafford with the rock group Genesis. They were screened together as a double bill. Rock promoters Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein purchased the films for the US market and distributed them as Sensasia.

It was internally called the CBF150M. The engine was taken from the CRF150F post 2005 engine. The previous version of CRF150F was the old CBZ classic. The design of the bike was done keeping in mind Indian road conditions. Many new features were incorporated, including a two-way air jacket and a diamond frame. The first version of the bike featured spoke wheels and kick start with an optional self-starter.

Honda claimed the Unicorn accelerated from  in 5 seconds. India Business Insight reported acceleration of  in 5.28–5.86 seconds, and a top speed of . (Air filled with Nitrogen.)

Honda released this motorcycle to compete with the Bajaj Pulsar and the TVS Apache. Changes included alloy wheels, powder coated engine with a polished head, electric starter, new graphics, clear lens indicator lamps, a trip meter, and a slightly smaller rear grab rail. Few performance changes included minor changes in the cylinder head, overhead valve, ignition remap and a rear sprocket increase of one tooth, which resulted in increased acceleration at the expense of reduced top speed. The air filter was changed from a dry paper to oil-coated to better suit dusty conditions and a new airflow screw in the carburetor.    HMSI sold 720,000 Unicorns in 2007.  The Unicorn overtook the Bajaj Pulsar to rank highest in its category, the premium segment, in the 2005 Motorcycle Total Customer Satisfaction (MTCS) survey of 7,000 customers conducted by the TNS specialist division, TNS Automotive.

Honda began selling the Unicorn Dazzler variation in 2010. It has different bodywork and uses rear disc brake instead of a drum brake.

358,24848842,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK%20model,AK model,"The AK model of economic growth is an endogenous growth model used in the theory of economic growth, a subfield of modern macroeconomics. In the 1980s it became progressively clearer that the standard neoclassical exogenous growth models were theoretically unsatisfactory as tools to explore long run growth, as these models predicted economies without technological change and thus they would eventually converge to a steady state, with zero per capita growth. A fundamental reason for this is the diminishing return of capital; the key property of AK endogenous-growth model is the absence of diminishing returns to capital.  In lieu of the diminishing returns of capital implied by the usual parameterizations of a Cobb–Douglas production function, the AK model uses a linear model where output is a linear function of capital.  Its appearance in most textbooks is to introduce endogenous growth theory.

Origin of the concept

In neoclassical growth models the economy is assumed to reach a steady state in which all macroeconomic variables grow at the same rate and in the absence of technological progress, per capita growth of these macroeconomic  variables will eventually cease.  These kind of neoclassical prepositions resemble the philosophical theories found in Ricardo and Malthus. The basic underlying assumption of neoclassical philosophy is that there are diminishing returns to capital in the production process.

During the mid-1980s a new growth theory was launched by Paul Romer in 1986, where he tried to explain the growth process in a different manner. Thus the dissatisfaction with neoclassical models motivated the construction of new growth theories where the key determinations are endogenous in the model; long run growth is not determined by exogenous factors but by endogenous factors in such models.

The simplest version of an endogenous model is the AK model which assumes constant exogenous saving rate and fixed level of technology.  The stickiest assumption of this model is that the production function does not include diminishing returns to capital. This assumption means the model can lead to endogenous growth.

Graphical representation of the model

The AK model production function is a special case of a Cobb–Douglas function with constant returns to scale.
 

This equation shows a Cobb–Douglas function where Y represents the total production in an economy. A represents total factor productivity, K is capital, L is labor, and the parameter  measures the output elasticity of capital. For the special case in which , the production function becomes linear in capital and does not have the property of decreasing returns to scale in the capital stock, which would prevail for any other value of the capital intensity between 0 and 1.

 = population growth rate
 = depreciation 
 = capital per worker 
 = output/income per worker
 = labor force 
 = saving rate

In an alternative form ,  embodies both physical capital and human capital.

 

In the above equation A is the level of technology which is positive constant and K represents volume of capital.
Hence, output per capita is:
   i.e.   

The model implicitly assumes that the average product of capital is equal to marginal product of capital which is equivalent to:

The model again assumes that labor force is growing at a constant rate ‘n’ and there is no depreciation of capital.  (δ = 0 )
In this case, the basic differential equation of neo-classical growth model would be:

Hence, 

But in the model

The Visehgan family
Viseh has 6 sons named Houman, Barman, Nastihan, Lahhak, Farshidvard and Piran. Piran is the king of Khotan and the Minister of Afrasiab, the king of Turan. Houman is the highest ranking commander of Turanian army.

The Viseh family is different from the Afrasiab family in the Shahnameh. Viseh is a great clan of the Visehgan dynasty and the Minister of the Pashang. But in the Iran-Turan war Viseh and Afrasiab, attack together. The Vishu and Afrasiab tribes appear to be of one race and two separate tribes

All of the members of this clan were killed in the battle of Davazdah Rokh. This incident was the beginning of Turan's decline and fall.

In Avesta, the House of Viseh was eliminated by House of Nowzar, but in Shahnameh, this is House of Goudarz that eliminate this clan.

365,32385392,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3%20May%20Constitution%20Day,3 May Constitution Day,"3 May Constitution Day (also 3rd May National Holiday; ) is a Polish national and public holiday that takes place on 3 May. The holiday celebrates the declaration of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. Festivities date back to the Duchy of Warsaw early in the 19th century, but it became an official holiday only in 1919 in the Second Polish Republic. Delisted during the times of the Polish People's Republic, it was reestablished after the fall of communism in modern Poland.

Background

The Constitution of 3 May 1791 is considered one of the most important achievements in the history of Poland, despite being in effect for only a year, until the Russo-Polish War of 1792. Historian Norman Davies calls it ""the first constitution of its type in Europe""; other scholars also refer to it as the world's second oldest constitution.

The 3 May Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy.
The adoption of the 3 May Constitution provoked the active hostility of the Commonwealth's neighbours, leading to the Second Partition of Poland in 1792, the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794 and the final, Third Partition of Poland, in 1795. In the words of two of its co-authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, it was ""the last will and testament of the expiring Fatherland.""

The memory of the 3 May Constitution—recognised by political scientists as a very progressive document for its time—for generations helped keep alive Polish aspirations for an independent and just society, and continued to inform the efforts of its authors' descendants. In Poland it is viewed as a national symbol, and the culmination of all that was good and enlightened in Polish history and culture.

The 3 May anniversary of its adoption has been observed as Poland's most important civil holiday since Poland regained independence in 1918. Its importance for the Polish people has been compared to that of 4 July to the Americans.

Celebrations

3 May was first declared a holiday on 5 May 1791, and celebrated a year later, on 3 May 1792. Banned during the partitions of Poland it was celebrated in the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, and unofficially in Congress Poland by various pro-independence activists, more openly during the times of insurrections, such as the November Uprising. It was again made an official Polish holiday in April 1919 under the Second Polish Republic—the first holiday officially introduced in the Second Polish Republic. The 3 May holiday was banned once more during World War II by the Nazi and Soviet occupiers. It was celebrated in the Polish cities in May 1945, although in a mostly spontaneous manner. The celebrations were officially canceled shortly before 3 May 1946, and the anti-communist demonstrations took place later that day. This, and the competition the date created with the communist-endorsed 1 May Labor Day celebrations, meant that the 3 May Constitution Day lost support with the authorities of the Polish People's Republic. In 1947 it was officially rebranded Democratic Party Day and removed from the list of national holidays either then or in 1951 (sources vary). Until 1989, 3 May was a common day for anti-government and anti-communist protests. 3 May was restored as an official Polish holiday in April 1990, after the fall of communism. In 2007, 3 May was also declared a Lithuanian national holiday; the first joint celebration by the Polish Sejm and the Lithuanian Seimas took place on 3 May 2007.

In modern Poland, this day, free from work, sees many parades, exhibitions, concerts and public figure speeches. Most important Polish politicians participate in those festivities; for example in 2011 President of Poland, Bronisław Komorowski, Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, and Marshal of the Sejm, Grzegorz Schetyna, Marshal of the Senate, Bogdan Borusewicz, and Minister of National Defence, Bogdan Klich, took part in the festivities in Warsaw. The official festivities in Warsaw or in other Polish cities in the presence of the President and important dignitaries would include flag flying, cannon salvos, reading of the constitution preamble, and singing a patriotic song from the November Uprising,  (Welcome, May Dawn) plus drill shows and the annual military parade. Other events of the 2011 celebrations in Warsaw included a celebratory mass (see: The Most Holy Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland) in St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw, and presidential awards for achievements in the field of advancing Polish culture. It is also held in various other Polish cities as well.

The holiday has been a focal point of ethnic celebrations of Polish-American pride in the Chicago area, where it is known as Polish Constitution Day, since 1892. Poles in Chicago have continued this tradition to the present day, marking it with festivities and the annual Polish Constitution Day Parade; guests of national stature, most notably Bobby Kennedy, have attended over the years as a way to ingratiate themselves with Chicago Polonia. In Minnesota, first celebrations date to the 1870s. In San Francisco, the anniversary of the May 3rd Constitution has been observed annually for decades in the Music Concourse at Golden Gate Park. In Buffalo, NY there is a Polish Happy Hour Buffalo event held every 3 May at the Adam Mickiewicz Library. There is free admission, free Polish food, Polish music played, and a reading of the preamble of the Polish Constitution in English and in Polish.

Notes
 a  The claims of ""first"" and ""second constitution"" have been disputed. Indeed, both documents in question (US and Polish constitutions) were preceded by earlier ones, including those also labelled as constitutions, e.g., the Corsican Constitution of 1755.* See History of the constitution for more information.

The little that has reached us of his voluminous works reveal an exceptionally gifted scholar, with treasured knowledge of vast scope. Living mostly in the latter part of the thirteenth century, he was also the last of the higher class of the Armenian authors of the ancient and medieval ages. Erznkatsi wrote hymns, commentaries, odes, eulogies, a Martyrology, an astronomical treatise on celestial elements, and a grammar. He was personally known and honored in almost every center of learning in Greater Armenia and Cilicia.

An outstanding orator, he was the main speaker on the occasion of the conferring of knighthood on Hetoum and Thoros, sons of King Leon III, which was celebrated at Sis in 1284. Having studied Latin, apparently at an advanced age, he translated certain parts of the Theology of Thomas Aquinas into Armenian.

Initially, the U.S. military claimed the sailors inadvertently entered Iranian waters owing to mechanical failure, but it was later reported that they entered Iranian waters because of navigational errors. The U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, called the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif within five minutes. His call was followed by multiple other phone calls between the two ministers. The sailors had a brief verbal exchange with the Iranian military and were released, unharmed, 15 hours later.

The release was hailed by the Obama administration as an unintended benefit of the new diplomatic relationship. Iran released pictures of captured US sailors. Some U.S. Republican 2016 presidential candidates such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump criticized the U.S. response to the detention, which they deemed too weak.

Incident

On January 12, 2016, two United States Navy riverine command boats cruising from Kuwait to Bahrain with a combined crew of nine men and one woman on board strayed into Iranian territorial waters which extend three nautical miles around Farsi Island in Persian Gulf. Patrol craft of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy seized the craft and detained the crew at a military base on Farsi Island.

According to military sources, the two RCBs were on a routine transit from Kuwait to Bahrain, which serves as the home port for Task Force 56 under the Fifth Fleet. They left Kuwait at 12:23 p.m local time and were scheduled to refuel with the U.S. Coast Guard Island Class Patrol Cutter USCGC Monomoy (WPB-1326) at 5 p.m. During the transit one RCB developed an engine problem, and both boats stopped to solve the mechanical issue. During this time they drifted into Iranian waters. At 5:10 p.m. the boats were approached by the two small Iranian center-console craft followed by two more boats. There was a verbal exchange between the Iranian and U.S personnel and the officer commanding the RCBs allowed the Iranian sailors to come aboard and take control. The Iranian forces made the sailors kneel with their hands behind their heads. The RCBs reported their engine failure to Task Force 56, and all communications were terminated after the report. A U.S. search-and-rescue effort was launched leading to ""robust bridge-to-bridge communications"" with Iranian military vessels, wherein the Iranians informed U.S. Navy cruiser  at 5:15 p.m that ""the RCBs and their crew were in Iranian custody at Farsi Island and were safe and healthy."" By the time a search-and-rescue effort got under way (it included sending a U.S. Navy and U.S Coast Guard vessel inside Iranian territorial waters over concern U.S. sailors could have been lost overboard), the sailors were already ashore.

John Kerry spoke with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at least five times by telephone. He called Zarif within five minutes. He states he ""gave him a very direct statement about what would happen if we didn't have their release very quickly."" Zarif called back within 20 minutes with assurances that the sailors would be released soon and that they were being ""well taken care of."" John Kerry has stated that in his other phone calls about the situation he ""made it crystal clear"" how serious it was and that ""it was imperative to get it resolved."" The sailors had a brief verbal exchange with the Iranian military and were released unharmed along with all their equipment  the next day on January 13 after 15 hours, and they departed the island at 08:43 GMT on their boats. They later were escorted by a U.S Coast Guard patrol cutter, while U.S. Navy overwatched and supported. The Pentagon oversaw the escort on high alert.

The IRGC stated that they released the sailors after their investigation concluded the ""illegal entry into Iranian water was not the result of a purposeful act.""

At first it was suggested that a mechanical failure in at least one of the boats led them to the Iranian waters, then it was verified that both boats returned to base under their own power. However, American military officials could not explain how they had lost contact with both of the boats.

The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards naval forces claimed that the U.S. apologized to Iran for incident. However, the U.S. government has stated that no apology was made.

According to the Fars News Agency on January 26, ""the American ships were 'snooping' around in Iranian waters,"" on the basis of the sailors' GPS data collected by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy. On January 29 Fars News Agency stated ""it was proved that the US marines had strayed into Iranian waters only due to the failure of their navigation devices and equipment.""

U.S. Central Command stated, ""A post-recovery inventory of the boats found that all weapons, ammunition and communication gear are accounted for minus two SIM cards that appear to have been removed from two handheld satellite phones."" The statement did not account for navigation equipment. A Navy command investigation continues and more details will be provided when it is completed.

Tasnim News Agency reported Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy Commander Admiral Ali Fadavi said in a February 1 parliamentary session, ""We have extracted extensive information from their [American sailors'] laptops and cell phones,"" and that the information can be made public if a decision is made to that effect.

According to the IRGC, when the Iranian forces seized the two boats, aircraft carriers USS Harry S. Truman and Charles de Gaulle had been patrolling in the international waters southeast and northeast of Farsi island, respectively, which IRGC Navy commander Ali Fadavi described it as ""unprofessional behavior for forty minutes.""

According to Brig. Gen. Farzad Esmaili, commander of Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base, after the IRGC Navy reported the capture of the U.S. Navy boats, the Air Defence switched on its missile systems and the Air Force fighter jets also scrambled. Three American F-18 fighters, a radar plane and a maritime patrol aircraft flew over the U.S. aircraft carriers and began to approach Farsi Island, conducted ""bullying"" behavior, and refused to respond to the signals, but made a contact later when the Iranian missiles zeroed on them and realized that they had ""less than 30 seconds to decide before Iran's missiles are fired.""

The U.S. Navy disciplined and/or reprimanded nine of the Navy men involved in the incident, ranging from higher commanders to sailors present on the boats.

Treatment of American military personnel
On the same day the American crewmembers were released with their vessels, Iran released a series of images and videos that, among other things, showed the U.S. Navy sailors on their knees with their hands clasped behind their heads as they were being apprehended on their vessels. Two of the videos featured one of the Americans, apparently the Navy lieutenant commanding the boats, apologizing and praising Iran's treatment: ""It was a mistake that was our fault, and we apologize for our mistake.... The Iranian behavior was fantastic while we were here and we thank you very much for your hospitality and your assistance."" According to Politico, these pictures and footage further ""inflam[ed] the American debate over [the sailors'] capture, including the question of whether the U.S. had formally apologized for entering Iranian territory."" A Defense Department official said that the lieutenant's filmed apology was probably intended to defuse a potentially volatile situation.

Reaction

Iran
 Iranian Armed Forces: Hossein Salami, Deputy Commander of the IRGC said that the Americans started crying during the detention and that no country has ever captured American service members since the Second World War. Ahmad Dolabi, commander of the IRGC unit that detained the American vessels said that the U.S. Navy personnel surrendered although they had all their weapons intact. Hassan Firouzabadi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces remarked that this latest incident may not be the last.
 Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei awarded a Fath military medal to Commander of the IRGC Navy Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi as well as four others involved in the capture, thanked them for their efforts and sanctioned their actions.
 Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif posted on Twitter that he was happy to see that dialogue and respect swiftly resolved the episode

 On the 38th anniversary of the Iranian Islamic Revolution, teenagers were dressed like American sailors and held in a submissive manner to simulate the arrest of American sailors. Some Iranians reacted to it via social networks by criticizing the action and calling it ""bizarre"" and a ""circus"". According to the Iranian newspaper irdiplomacy, some social media websites are blocked in Iran so these reactions are not ""broadly representative of views inside the country.""

United States
 Secretary of State John Kerry thanked Iranian authorities for their cooperation, adding that ""we can all imagine how a similar situation might have played out three or four years ago."" However, he later stated that he was angry at videos of U.S. sailors being used for propaganda.
 According to the Obama administration, the speedy release of the sailors ""shows the power of diplomacy and the promise of its new engagement with Iran.""
 On February 14, 2016, U.S. Republican senator John McCain said he would subpoena the 10 U.S. sailors to testify about their brief detention by Iran if the Obama administration did not provide the findings of an investigation into the incident by March 1.
 On May 12, 2016, The U.S. Navy fired Commander Eric Rasch, the executive commander of the squadron that included the ten captured sailors.
 Several critiques of the US Navy emerged after the investigation was published, though few changes were made.
 The Navy handed down punishments to two officers and two enlisted sailors in charge of the riverine boat crews who surrendered in Iranian waters, causing an international incident and bringing embarrassment on the Navy for the litany of errors that led to their arrest and violations of regulations while in custody.

368,681893,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis%20Murphy%20%28musician%29,Dennis Murphy (musician),"Dennis Murphy (January 19, 1934 – November 29, 2010) was a composer, musician, instrument maker, artist, and playwright.

Dennis Murphy was one of the fathers of American gamelan (along with William Colvig).  Lou Harrison credits Murphy as being the first North American to build gamelan instruments.  He composed numerous works and shadow plays for gamelan.

Starting around 1959 or 1960, while earning a master's degree in theory and composition at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Madison, Murphy got interested in gamelan during a survey course which included a section on ethnomusicology.  He heard a recording of Javanese gamelan and was hooked.  About that time, the head of the economics department, L. Reed Tripp, returned from Java where he had been on a Ford Foundation grant.  While in Indonesia, Tripp's two young sons became involved with a children's gamelan group.  The boys loved it so much that their parents bought a small slendro gamelan and shipped it to their home in Madison.  Then Mrs. Tripp called Bob Crane, a composition professor, and asked if he knew anyone who would like to try Javanese Gamelan.  So Crane, Murphy and his wife Pat, and few more people started learning what the children could show them, and it went from there.

Shortly after this, Murphy began constructing gamelan instruments and started composing short pieces for gamelan at the same time.  The whole story is described in ""The Autochthonous American Gamelan"", Murphy's thesis written while working towards his PhD in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University in Connecticut. He named the gamelan ""Venerable Sir Voice of Thoom"" and invented an entire cosmology and artificial language to go with it (Thoomese).

Murphy started teaching at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont in the fall 1967.  A student group using Murphy's instruments had its first performance the same year.  More instruments were made with occasional student help.  Instruments were hammered out of steel, or made from found objects such as a car hubcap, soup cans, or an antique milk-strainer.  For a couple of years there were nine people in the ensemble (three were named Dennis.) The Goddard Gamelan performed traditional Javanese gamelan pieces along with pieces composed by Murphy and students.  By the mid seventies the ensemble had grown to full complement of instruments tuned in both pelog and slendro.  Students designed and constructed a building to house the instruments for rehearsals and performances.

In 1980, Goddard made major cuts to its academic programs, and the gamelan moved to the Plainfield Community Center and was renamed the Plainfield Village Gamelan.  Later, the ensemble moved to Murphy's farm in Plainfield where the group continued to perform.  In later years, Murphy was a faculty member with the Vermont Governor's Institute on the Arts.

Several of Murphy's students have become instrument makers.  Barbara Benary while not a student of Murphy made a gamelan following directions in Murphy's thesis, and then went on to make more instruments of her own design, notably giant bar-and-resonator gongs, using one-gallon paint cans to build the tubes.

Murphy also composed pieces of chamber and choral music.  He performed with the Fyre & Lightning Consort and the Nisht Geferlach Klezmer Band.  He also wrote a number of plays which might be loosely categorized with the Theatre of the Absurd, among them ""The Goat Painter"" and ""The Half-Moon Window"".  Many of the words and phrases in these plays, such as ""Rug Sand,"" ""Office Oil,"" and Hospital Ice,"" were taken from the page headers from the local Yellow Pages.  He was a vegetarian and did not wear anything made from animal products, preferring a rope belt and flip-flops in all kinds of weather.

The Congress was attended by 2,344 delegates out of the 468,175 members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.

Background 
It was the first Congress of Yugoslav communists held after World War II, takeover of power in the country and establishment of the SFR Yugoslavia, but also the first major gathering of Yugoslav communists held since the 5th Territorial Conference, held in October 1940. Although 20 years had passed since the previous meeting, the 5th Congress was held in November 1928, and 8 years have passed since the 5th Territorial Conference, the main reason for conveying the Congress was the ""Resolution of the Informbiro"", adopted by Soviet–dominated Cominform on 28 June 1948 in Bucharest, Romania.

The Congress 
The main topic of the Congress was the ""Resolution of the Informbiro"" and supporting the Yugoslav leadership in resisting Cominform. The broadest publicity to the Congress was given by direct radio broadcasting and extensive press coverage. Reports to the Congress were submitted by Josip Broz Tito, Aleksandar Ranković, Milovan Đilas, Edvard Kardelj, Boris Kidrič, Moša Pijade and Blagoje Nešković.

The Congress gave political support to the Central Committee in ""defending the independence"" of Yugoslavia. The decision was made unanimously, by which the unity of the party was ""confirmed"". The Congress also adopted the ""Resolution on the position of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia towards Cominform"", which concluded that decisions of Cominform were inaccurate and unjust, but it was emphasized that the Central Committee should do everything to overcome the conflict.

At the end of the Congress, a new Central Committee consisting of 63 members, and a new Politburo consisting of 9 members, were elected. Josip Broz Tito was re-elected as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.

375,1126492,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender%20Precision%20Bass,Fender Precision Bass,"The Fender Precision Bass (often shortened to ""P-Bass"") is a model of electric bass manufactured by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. In its standard, post-1957 configuration, the Precision Bass is a solid body, four-stringed instrument equipped with a single split-coil humbucking pickup and a one-piece, 20-fret maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.

Its prototype, designed by Leo Fender in 1950, was brought to market in 1951. It was the first electric bass to earn widespread attention and use, remaining among the best-selling and most-imitated electric basses with considerable effect on the sound of popular music.

Background
The double bass, as a very large instrument, is often regarded as physically cumbersome and difficult to transport compared with smaller instruments. It is also hard to hear in large bands or those that use amplified instruments, and it requires specialized skills to play that are distinct from those required to play the guitar.

The Precision Bass was designed to overcome these problems. The name ""Precision"" came from the use of frets to play in tune more easily than on the fretless fingerboard of the double bass. The electric bass, however, lacks the distinctive acoustic qualities of the double bass, offering a more solid, harder-edged sound with more sustain. After initial resistance from double-bass players, the electric bass guitar became increasingly dominant and transformed the beat and rhythm of pop music from jump blues and swing to rhythm and blues, rock, soul and funk.

Acceptance of the electric bass was initially slow, as upright bassists looked at this new instrument with similar contempt, as guitar players did with its solid-body sibling, the Telecaster. It was vibraphonist/drummer Lionel Hampton's band that was among the first to incorporate the new instrument, with subsequent help by the endorsement of Elvis Presley's bass-player Bill Black, who was beginning to use a Precision Bass during the filming of Jailhouse Rock. It was reputed that Black became so frustrated over his initial inability to get used to playing it, he angrily threw it on the floor. Fender also delivered an early Precision to Los Angeles session bassist and arranger Shifty Henry. Monk Montgomery became the second jazz player to popularize the ""Fender Bass""; first, while playing with Lionel Hampton; and then with his brother, guitarist Wes Montgomery. By 1954 bassists Henry and Montgomery were both appearing in Fender's advertising. By the end of the 1950's the ""P-Bass"" was finally gaining acceptance with both rock 'n roll and country bassists, as well as guitarists who would double on the instrument; most notable, was Carol Kaye, a jazz guitarist, who as a bassist became best-known for her work as part of the consortium of L.A. session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew.

Design alterations and variants 

The original Precision Bass of 1951 shared several of its design features with the six-string Telecaster guitar, the main difference being its double cutaway body. The 1954 release of the Stratocaster with its contoured edges for comfort, was inspired by the Precision bass, which in kind, also received the same style body contours.
In 1957 the headstock and pickguard were redesigned to resemble the Stratocaster, with a rounder neck heel replacing the original square shape. A redesigned pickguard was made of a single layer of gold-anodized aluminium with 10 screw holes. At the same time the original single-coil pickup was replaced by the Precision split-coil design with staggered pole pieces, connected in a humbucking mode. However, Fender never emphasized this, as the Seth Lover patent on the humbucking pickup had not yet expired.

In 1959 a glued-on rosewood fingerboard featuring ""clay""-style dot position markers replaced the 1-piece maple neck and remained standard until 1966/67, when the CBS-owned Fender companies began to offer a separate, laminated maple fingerboard capped on a maple neck. Rosewood fingerboards were then made of a veneered, round-laminated piece of wood and pearloid dot markers replaced the ""clay""-style inlays introduced in 1959.

In 1960 the aluminum pickguard was replaced with a 13-screw celluloid design having 3 or 4 layers of black, white, white pearloid or brown ""tortoise-shell"").  In that same year the newly designed Fender Jazz Bass was released.

The original Telecaster-derived design, with a few updates, was reintroduced in 1968 as the Fender Telecaster Bass. Within a few years, however, it had evolved into a model distinctly different from the contemporary Precision Bass, alongside which it was marketed through 1979. Two artist-designed models use the Telecaster Bass body style; the Mike Dirnt Precision Bass, using today's standard single split-coil pick-up, and the Sting Precision Bass, using a single coil pick-up as did the earliest design.

Since 1969 the 1-piece maple neck option has been fitted to many Fender basses and the rosewood fretboard offered as an alternative. Some Precision Basses made in the 1970s were also available with an unlined fretless rosewood, ebony or (usually) maple fingerboard, popularized by endorsees Sting and Tony Franklin. Fender briefly offered a fretless P Bass in the mid-1990s as a part of the first-generation American Standard line but dropped this variant at the end of the 20th century.

In 1968, The headstock graphic was changed to a new ""waterslide"" design.  In 1977, the ""Precision Bass"" wordmark was changed to a smaller, sans-serif design.

Active electronics models
From 1980 to 1984 various models of the Precision Bass were given new active pickups and a high-mass brass bridge. The Special (1980) featured a split-coil pickup with white covers, gold hardware, a 2-band EQ and an active/passive toggle switch. The Elite (1983) had one (Elite I) or two (Elite II) split-coil humbucking pickups, TBX tone circuit and a Schaller fine-tune bridge later used on the Plus Series models of the early 1990s. Some models were available with solid walnut body and stained ebony fretboard. 

Precision Bass Lyte models were made in Japan and came to the market in late 1984.  They had a smaller body shape and a modern C-shape maple neck with 22 medium-jumbo frets. They had an active P-J pickup configuration with a 2 band eq and pickup pan knob. They were produced until 1995.  

The later 1980s and 1990s saw the introduction of the Precision Plus and Deluxe Plus basses in 1989 and 1991, featuring Lace Sensor pickups, fine-tuner bridges, 22-fret necks and passive or active electronics on certain models. The limited-edition Custom Shop 40th Anniversary model of 1991 was a  luxurious version of the Precision Plus Deluxe bass with gold hardware, a quilted maple top with no pickguard, highly figured neck, 3 stacked knobs and an ebony fretboard with side dot position markers. Only 400 of this model were produced. 
Some P-Basses with J-style bridge pickups used the Jazz Bass control layout—2 volumes and tone—and a side-mount jack socket. Others had the front pickup volume control moved forward to leave room for a top-mounted jack socket.
Other variants include dual stacked control knobs similar to that of an early 1960s Jazz Bass or a 3-way pickup selector switch (as used on the Tony Franklin Signature and Plus Series P-Basses).

Model additions and name changes
In 1983, Fender introduced the Standard Series with a new Bullet truss rod system, updated die-cast tuning machines, chrome hardware, white pickup covers and a single-ply white pick guard.  The Headstock graphics were changed to reflect a blend of new and vintage.  The Fender logo remained underneath the string guide but was changed to silver with a black outline. The ""Precision Bass"" wordmark was changed to a boldface font similar to the early 1960's model but remained to the right of the Fender logo.
From 1984 to 2000, this would be referred to as the American Standard Precision Bass.  The most notable visual change was the return to black pickup covers.  The model was revamped in 1995.  In 1996, a special run of 500 instruments was sold as the Limited Edition 50th Anniversary Precision Bass to celebrate the company's anniversary.  This model had gold hardware and a ""Fender 50"" stamp on the neck plate.

In 1984, Fender introduced a lower cost Standard Precision Bass model made in Japan.  The Standard model would be made in Japan until 1990 when Fender shifted operations to its new Mexican factory which produced the model from 1991 to 2018.

The American Deluxe Precision Bass was added to the revamped lineup in 1995. It had an Ash Body (offered until 2006), 18-volt preamp with 3-Band Active EQ and an added Humbucker in the bridge position.

The American Series Precision Bass was introduced in 2000 and discontinued in 2008. From 2003 the S-1 switching system allowed the pickup coils to be switched from series to parallel, offering a wider tonal range, but this was discontinued in 2008 with the second generation of American Standard Series instruments. 2011 models bear a special ""Fender 60"" badge on the back of the body to celebrate the company's 60th Anniversary.

In 2002, Fender added a new lower-cost American passive model series known as the Highway One. There were two iterations of this line - known as Highway 1 and Highway One. Highway 1 featured 60's spaghetti logo, and a nut side truss rod adjustment port. They were painted with thin nitro lacquer.  In 2006, it was updated with a BadAss II bridge with grooved saddles and a Greasebucket tone circuit. The Highway One Precision Bass featured '70s styling and thin satin nitro lacquer finish. The series remained available until it was discontinued in 2011. 

The American Standard, American Deluxe (featuring a J-style humbucking pickup in the bridge position and an active 3-band EQ with an 18V power supply), Highway One  and American Vintage series models were manufactured in Corona, California.

Following the success of the Aerodyne Jazz Bass, Fender briefly produced the Japanese-made Aerodyne Classic Precision Bass from 2006-2008.  This model retained the basic shape of the classic Precision but had dramatically thinner contours.  It had a basswood body with figured maple top and cream binding, Precision and Single-coil Jazz pickup combination and matching finish headstock.

In December 5, 2008, the American Standard Precision Bass was updated with CBS era-style decals, a 3-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.

Fender offered the Made-in-Mexico Blacktop Series from 2013–2014.  Like Most of the other instruments in this series, the Blacktop Precision Bass was given high-output humbuckers.  It also had a Hi-Mass Bridge, Vintage Jazz Bass Style Knobs (Volume, Volume, Tone) and a C-shape neck with 9.5"" Radius. 

In May 2016, Fender brought back the American Elite Precision Bass to replace the American Deluxe series.  The new model featured a Precision neck pickup combined with a 4th-generation Jazz noiseless pickup, 18-volt active circuit with 3-band EQ, passive bypass switch, Posiflex graphite support rods in the neck which.

Fender produced this bass until 2019.

In January 2017, Fender retired its American Standard line to be replaced by the American Professional Series.  The Precision Bass was updated with new V-Mod pickups, upgraded tuners that featured increased sustain and better tuning stability, Narrow-Tall frets and a ’63 P Bass profile neck.  Fender ceased production of this model in 2020.

Squier models
Fender initially revived the Squier sub-brand to produce lower-cost guitars and basses in 1982. The first model the brand produced was the JV Series which was made in Japan. This later became known as the Squier Traditional P-Bass and was retired in 1996.

The current basic model is the Affinity Precision Bass.  This model was introduced in 1996 and was made in China.  In more recent years, the Affinity Precision Bass PJ (named for its Precision-Jazz pickup configuration) was added to the lineup.

380,13060111,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turenne%2C%20Corr%C3%A8ze,"Turenne, Corrèze","Turenne (; ) is a commune in the Corrèze department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in central France. It is characterised by its height and unique position on top of a cliff.

It is one of the most beautiful villages of France (along with 157 others, including neighbouring Loubressac, Autoire, Curemonte and Carennac). It also has a well-known castle.

Geography
Turenne sits atop the Martel Causse, a limestone formation which now supports rich forests as well as intricate caves. The region is quite hilly, and is cut through by the Dordogne and Vézère rivers, which provide nearby activities like canoeing.

Economy
The local economy is primarily agricultural, with a fair amount of tourism. The region is known for its excellent produce, including walnuts, mushrooms, truffles, and foie gras.

History
The first lords of Turenne appeared in the 9th century. The town became a veritable feudal state after the Crusades and one of the great fiefs of France in the 14th century. From the Middle Ages to the 18th century, the viscount of Turenne had complete autonomy. Until 1738 the sheriffs, despite honoring the French king with simple tributes, were free of taxation and acted as true sovereigns; convening the Estates General, raising taxes, coining money, and ennobling. The Viscounty formed a state within a state. Thus, when the king banned tobacco (introduced in Aquitaine in 1560), the measure did not apply in the viscounty.

The fiefdom of Turenne occupied a territory bounded by three provinces and three bishoprics. Part of the Périgord Noir (Black Périgord), the fiefdom was adjacent to Lower Limousin and Quercy. It controlled the transfer of livestock between the plateaus of Quercy and Limousin, At its largest in the 15th century, it spanned from around Meymac or Lapleau to the north-east, Terrasson to the west, and Gramat to the south. At that time, the major fortified cities of the Viscount were Argentat, Servieres, Beaulieu, Gagnac, Martel, Saint-Cere, and Turenne; other walled cities included the bastides of Bretenoux and Puybrun, the cities of Carennac, Vayrac, Curemonte, Meyssac, and Collonges. There are now about 100,000 inhabitants in the entire region, divided into 18,500 ""feux"", 111 parishes, 1200 villages, and many monasteries.

Turenne has seen a succession of four families of Viscounts. From the 9th century to the thirteenth, the Comborn, from the valley of the Vézère (and who had actively participated in the Crusades and Anglo-French wars) obtained extensive privileges from the kings of France. Then, during the first half of the 14th century, the Viscounty was taken over by the Comminges, Pyrenées feudal lords, before being transferred for 94 years to Roger de Beaufort from which came two Popes of Avignon, Clement VI and Gregory XI. This family had two Viscounts: Roger William III of Beaufort and Raymond de Turenne XIII, and two viscountesses names Antoinette de Turenne and Eleonore de Beaujeu. Then, from 1444 to 1738, the Viscounty became the possession of the family of La Tour d'Auvergne. In their heyday, Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, co-religionist and companion-at-arms of King Henry IV, became Duke of Bouillion and Prince of Sedan. His son Henry, Marshal of France, received the nickname ""The Great Turenne"".

Under La Tour d'Auvergne, the Viscounty lasted until the Reformation. Calvinism was spread by the boatmen of the Dordogne throughout the region. In 1575, after St. Bartholomew, Henri de la Tour engaged with Henri of Navarre and Turenne became a hotbed of religious wars and disorders of the Fronde.

On 8 June 1738, Turenne was sold to Louis XV to pay the gambling debts of Charles Godfrey, the last of the Viscounts of La Tour d'Auvergne family. Thus ended the quasi-independence of this last French stronghold. The Viscounty's subjects became subjects of Louis XV and were forced to pay taxes. The king also ordered the dismantling of the fortress of Turenne. As of the French Revolution, Turenne was more like a seat of a royal provost.

Under the Revolution, to follow a decree of the Convention, the town changed its name to Mount Franc (the name was later restored to Turenne).

382,260225,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alburgh%20%28town%29%2C%20Vermont,"Alburgh (town), Vermont","Alburgh (formerly Alburg) is a town in Grand Isle County, Vermont, United States, founded in 1781 by Ira Allen. The population was 2,106 at the 2020 United States Census. Alburgh is on the Alburgh Tongue, a peninsula extending from Canada into Lake Champlain, and lies on the only road-based route across Lake Champlain to New York state north of Addison, Vermont.

Name spelling change
The original name of the town, ""Alburgh"", was changed to ""Alburg"" in 1891 by recommendation of the United States Board on Geographic Names. The board recommended that all municipality names ending in ""-burgh"" be revised to end in ""-burg"" for the sake of standardization. In April 2006, the Vermont Department of Libraries (in its capacity as the authority on Vermont place names) approved the town's request to change its name from Alburg back to Alburgh after a majority vote on town meeting day.

European settlement of Alburgh Tongue and founding of Alburgh 
A two-league strip between Missisquoi Bay and the Chambly River (now the Richelieu River) north of the Alburgh tongue was granted by Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois, and Intendant of New France Gilles Hocquart to Seigneur François Foucault on April 3, 1733 (ratified by the King of France April 6, 1734). Other seigneuries (in particular the seigneurie de la Fontaine to the south) were granted but were not settled. Janvrin Dufresne surveyed the land for the government and submitted his report on June 14, 1737, that the seigneuries were not settled. Foucault thence resubmitted his application to the land in March 1739 (requesting an extension of one league to the south), having established Missiskouy (Missiquoi) Village with six inhabitants. On May 10, 1741, the seigneuries were deemed forfeited for lack of settlement; on May 1, 1743, Foucault's application was accepted (ratified by the King on March 25, 1745). In 1744, Foucault petitioned to extend his seigneurie over the entire peninsula to a total length of five leagues and including the former seigneurie de la Fontaine; the petition was granted November 1, 1744. By 1747, however, the peninsula had been abandoned by any European settlers.

In 1763 at the end of the French and Indian War, New France was ceded to Great Britain. General James Murray purchased the lands including Foucault's seigneurie, and his nephew Richard Murray granted a 99-year lease of the seigneurie to Colonel Henry Caldwell in 1774.

Alburgh was charted February 23, 1781, by Ira Allen and 64 others. Allen paid for the charting, and the name of the town is probably derived from ""Allensburgh"".

In 1781 Allen was part of the commission that negotiated the Vermont–New York boundary, placing the Alburgh Tongue in Vermont. In 1783 the Canada–United States border was established at the 45th parallel north, making the Vermonter claims to the land undisputed.

Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  are land and , or 40.31%, are water.

Alburgh is one of only six non-island locations in the 48 contiguous states not directly connected to them by land, the others being nearby Province Point, Vermont; Point Roberts, Washington; Elm Point, Minnesota; the Northwest Angle in Minnesota; and an unnamed point in North Dakota. However, there are bridges to Rouses Point, New York, (U.S. Route 2) and Swanton, Vermont, as well as to North Hero island to the southeast. This makes Alburgh not practically an exclave, unlike the other locations not connected to the United States by land. Isle La Motte lies to the southwest. Alburgh Dunes State Park has one of the most natural and longest beaches on Lake Champlain.

This gens is known primarily from two individuals: Publius Attius Atimetus, a physician to Augustus, and another physician of the same name, who probably lived later during the first century AD, and may have been a son of the first.  A member of this family rose to the consulship in the early second century, but his career is known entirely from inscriptions.

Members
 Publius Attius Atimetus, physician to Augustus, perhaps the same person as the freedman of the physician Cassius, who lived in the time of Scribonius Largus, physician to Claudius, and who was quoted by Galen, who gives his name as Atimetrus.
 Publius Attius Atimetus, another physician, probably later during the first century AD.

388,8257213,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%20B.%20Fox,Mitchell B. Fox,"Mitchell B. Fox is an American businessman. He was the Group President and Publishing Director of Condé Nast Publications, the President and CEO of The Golf Digest Companies, and Publisher of Vanity Fair and Details magazines. 
Fox was the Vice President and Publisher of Vanity Fair during its rise in the 1990s. As Group President, his responsibilities included overseeing Condé Nast's golf properties, its Fairchild fashion group including W magazine and Women's Wear Daily, its Bridal group, and other magazines, including Self, Allure, Bon Appetit, and Condé Nast Traveler.

Early career
Fox joined Condé Nast in 1989 when he became publisher of Details. While Fox was Publisher, Details was awarded ""Magazine of the Year"" (1994) by AdAge, and twice earned top ten honors (1993 and 1994) on AdWeek Magazine's ""Hot List"". He received criticism from The Baltimore Sun and The Philadelphia Enquirer, who stated the ads in Details were “racy” and “raunchy”, to which he replied “It’s completely consistent with the value system our readers have.”  The New York Times called Fox's leadership at Details ""one of Conde Nast's big success stories"" with 41% increase in circulation in 1993.

Vanity Fair
In 1994, Fox was appointed publisher of Vanity Fair. In 1996 Fox was named Conde Nast Publisher of the Year  with a record number of ad pages, totaling 1,523 in 1996. Fox's leadership at Vanity Fair went on to break more records with 1,809 ad pages in 1997, and again with 1,882 ad pages in 1998, including fashion ads up 14% and beauty ads up 19%.  According to Advertising Age, since Fox's arrival at Vanity Fair from Details in 1994, ad sales at Vanity Fair had risen by a ""staggering 69%” by 1998. During his time as publisher of Vanity Fair, the magazine began its annual Academy Awards party.

Condé Nast
In 1997, Fox was appointed vice-president of Condé Nast in charge of Corporate Sales. In November 1999, he was promoted to senior vice president of corporate sales. In 2001, Fox was named president and CEO of The Golf Digest Company, Advance Publications' titles Golf Digest, Golf For Women, Golf World, Golf World Business, and GolfDigest.com upon acquisition of these titles from The New York Times Company. In January 2007, Fox took over most of Mary Berner's responsibilities upon her departure from Condé Nast, adding W, WWD, DNR, FootWear News, The Condé Nast Bridal Group, and Bon Appétit to his existing responsibilities. Fox became group president of Condé Nast in 2007  and was named one of the leaders of the magazine world by AdAge.

Departure from Condé Nast
In early January 2008, Fox was terminated by Condé Nast. The New York Times reported his departure as sudden ""high-level shake-up"" among management at Condé Nast, in which his multi-media, multi-platform  strategy conflicted with existing plans for the company, leading to his ouster. The Post described this event, which coincided with the ousting of Lucky magazine's publisher, as ""a bloodbath at Condé Nast"". Some media reports suggest the death of a longtime ally may explain his sudden departure from the company, and tabloids suggest motives of a rival, but many media sources do not provide information on the reason for his departure. The email he sent upon departure and the company's memo were leaked to BusinessWeek.

From Conde Nast, Fox became president/CEO of 8020 Media Company, a San Francisco web based media company that manages two online communities and magazines. 8020 Media was sold to a group of investors in 2010.

Fox was a national trustee of The First Tee, a charitable organization, and is a member of the Esteemed Council of Advisors for the Telluride Film Festival. Fox also represented his company as a member of the board of directors of The Magazine Publishers of America (MPA), and was a member of its executive committee.

History
Fox graduated from the State University of Stony Brook in 1977.
He began his career at The New York Times where he worked for seven years, ultimately as Group Manager, Retail Advertising. In 1984, Fox left The New York Times to join Bergdorf Goodman as the advertising director. He was later promoted to senior vice president of sales promotion at Bergdorf Goodman.

Currently
Fox lives in New York City and has created a holding company (WGA Global Marketing, Inc.) with multiple businesses. He sits on the board of advisors of both the College of Business and the School of Journalism at Stony Brook University. Fox has also been a distinguished speaker at Stanford Business School and Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism. He served for two years at Pitney Bowes as the Executive Business Development Strategist in their global ecommerce division working with retailers and online merchants to grow their business globally. Fox has also become involved in MyGrove as senior advisor, a media company that targets active adult communities.

Fox was recruited to serve on the board of advisors of Viridian Capital Advisors, the leading investment bank in the cannabis industry. In 2016, he was recruited to be on the board of directors of Civilized.Life, a Los Angeles/Canada-based media company focused on the cannabis industry.

They provide information about his prolific career.Which is ironic as his family tree now includes two mixed race Aboriginal branches.

Early life
Robert was the son of Peter Bostock, a joiner living in Tarvin and his wife Elizabeth, née Blease, who died shortly after Robert's birth. His father remarried two years later. However his second wife, Ann, also died, in 1748.

Slave trader in Liverpool
Robert married Elizabeth Wilkinson in Tarvin in 1770 and by 1772 was living in Liverpool. He joined the congregation of St Anne's Church, Liverpool, occupying three pews. Charles Wilkinson was related to him and worked as his agent in London before settling on the Rio Pongo. Richard Bostock maintained correspondence with him there.

390,1695107,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao%20Shuang,Cao Shuang,"Cao Shuang (died 9 February 249), courtesy name Zhaobo, was a Chinese military general and regent of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was the eldest son of Cao Zhen, a prominent general of Wei. He initially held great power in Wei as General-in-Chief but later lost his power to Sima Yi in the Incident at Gaoping Tombs and was executed on charges of treason.

Life
Around 239, when the Wei emperor Cao Rui became critically ill, he resolved to pass the throne to his adopted son, Cao Fang. He initially wanted to entrust Cao Fang to his uncle Cao Yu, to serve as the lead regent, along with Xiahou Xian (夏侯獻), Cao Shuang, Cao Zhao (曹肇) and Qin Lang. However, his trusted officials Liu Fang (劉放) and Sun Zi (孫資), who were unfriendly with Xiahou Xian and Cao Zhao, became apprehensive upon hearing that Cao Rui wanted to appoint them as regents. They managed to persuade the dying emperor to appoint Cao Shuang (with whom they were friendly) and Sima Yi (who was then with his troops at Ji County (汲縣; in present-day Xinxiang, Henan) as the regents instead. Cao Yu, Cao Zhao and Qin Lang were excluded from the regency. As a result, Cao Shuang came to power in the final days of Cao Rui's reign. However, Cao Shuang was clearly inadequate for the important task assigned to him. When Cao Rui asked if he was competent enough, Cao Shuang was so nervous that he was unable to speak, so Liu Fang stepped on his foot and whispered into his ear, urging him to say: ""I will serve the dynasty to my death.""

Despite his inability, Cao Shuang and his brothers, Cao Xi (曹羲) and Cao Xun (曹訓), wielded great power in Wei. He was also often at odds with his co-regent Sima Yi, who had greater influence and support. In 243, Sima Yi's position was further strengthened by another successful deployment: Zhuge Ke, a general of Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu, was constantly sending agents to Shouchun (壽春; around present-day Shou County, Anhui) to prepare an invasion, so Sima Yi led Wei forces to Shu County (舒縣), Lujiang Commandery (盧江郡) near the Wei–Wu border. Upon hearing the news, the Wu emperor Sun Quan immediately ordered Zhuge Ke to withdraw to Chaisang (柴桑), Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡). Sima Yi's popularity and influence instantly multiplied as he was cheered as being able to scare away the enemy numbering over 100,000 without a fight and thus secured the border and saved Shouchun from certain attack. Cao Shuang, feeling insecure over Sima Yi's triumph, managed to persuade the emperor Cao Fang to promote Sima Yi to the position of Grand Tutor (太傅). While it was ostensibly a promotion for Sima Yi, the position of Grand Tutor was in fact an honorary one without any real authority over military affairs.

Cao Shuang was desperate for a victory to boost his own fame so he selected Shu Han, Wei's other rival state, as his target. Leading an army numbering over 100,000 troops, Cao Shuang invaded Shu territory in March 244. However, two months later, he lost to Shu forces led by Wang Ping and Fei Yi at the Battle of Xingshi and barely escaped back to Chang'an. Cao Shuang's popularity and influence dropped to a new low after his defeat. At the same time, Sima Yi's popularity and influence further increased due to his opposition to the campaign from the start. Potentially to deceive Cao Shuang into letting down his guard, Sima Yi stopped engaging in any political activity in May 247 and retired on the grounds of illness. He went on further to pretend to be ill and senile. In the same year, Cao Shuang followed the advice of Li Sheng, Deng Yang and Ding Mi in order to maintain his power.

In the winter of 248, Cao Shuang's protégé, Li Sheng, was appointed as the Inspector of Jing Province by the Wei imperial court. Before he left Luoyang to assume office in Jing Province, Cao Shuang sent him to check on Sima Yi. Cao Shuang and his followers overjoyed when Li Sheng reported that Sima Yi was indeed ill and that he could not even hear what Li Sheng said. According to Li Sheng, Sima Yi misheard ""Jing Province"" as ""Bing Province"". Cao Shuang sensed that Sima Yi no longer posed a threat to him and started to lower his guard against the latter.

On 5 February 249, Cao Shuang and his two brothers, Cao Xi (曹羲) and Cao Xun (曹訓), left the imperial capital Luoyang to accompany the emperor Cao Fang to pay respects to his ancestors at the Gaoping Tombs (高平陵). After that, they proceeded to go on a hunting expedition outside Luoyang.

Execution
Sima Yi and his sons seized the opportunity to launch a coup d'état and take command of the military forces stationed in Luoyang. Sima Yi first sent his supporters to take control of the positions held by Cao Shuang and his brothers: Gao Rou replaced Cao Shuang as Minister over the Masses (司徒); Wang Guan (王觀) replaced Cao Xi as Minister Coachman (太僕). Sima Yi then went to see Empress Dowager Guo and coerce her into issuing an imperial order for the arrest of Cao Shuang and his brothers under charges of treason.

Huan Fan, one of Cao Shuang's advisers, managed to escape from Luoyang with the official seal of General-in-Chief and bring it to Cao Shuang. As his family members were being held hostage in Luoyang, Cao Shuang entered a dilemma on whether he should surrender to Sima Yi or not. However, after Sima Yi promised him that he and his family would not be harmed, Cao Shuang surrendered and relinquished his power to Sima Yi. On 9 February 249, Cao Shuang's fate was sealed. After gaining power, Sima Yi broke his promise, had Cao Shuang and his family arrested and put to death on charges of treason.

History
A small amount of Jews have resided in the Balkan peninsula since the Antiquity. However, most Jews arrived here after being expelled from Western Europe. The Sephardic Jews came to the Balkans in the 1490s after Spain was established as a Catholic country. Many Ashkenazi Jews also came to the Balkans in the 1400s because of persecution in northern European countries.

More specifically, an  king's graph is a king's graph of an  chessboard. It is the map graph formed from the squares of a chessboard by making a vertex for each square and an edge for each two squares that share an edge or a corner. It can also be constructed as the strong product of two path graphs.

For an  king's graph the total number of vertices is  and the number of edges is . For a square  king's graph this simplifies so that the total number of vertices is  and the total number of edges is .

The neighbourhood of a vertex in the king's graph corresponds to the Moore neighborhood for cellular automata.
A generalization of the king's graph, called a kinggraph, is formed from a squaregraph (a planar graph in which each bounded face is a quadrilateral and each interior vertex has at least four neighbors) by adding the two diagonals of every quadrilateral face of the squaregraph.

The show was a hit right in its early days. It struck a chord with the evening listenership that would drive back from work, and as Anuj would say, ""recharge"" their batteries on their way home. Anuj enjoyed immense popularity through the show. The name stuck with him and he is fondly called RJ ""Recharge"" Anuj to this day. Anuj shifted to the 5:00–9:00 pm time slot after a year, yet, commanded a dedicated listenership in Hyderabad.

Owing to his personal connect and popularity with listeners, he was awarded ""No.1 RJ across All-India Radio City"" for the year 2006–07. Anuj was soon shifted to the morning show, The Radio City Breakfast Show, from 7:00 am to 11:00 am, where he, with Shraddha, gave a fun and energetic start to the day. The chirpy, positive and friendly banter between them had Hyderabad tuned in every morning. In February 2008, Anuj was awarded ""India's Best Radio Host for 2007-08"" in a nationwide search.

Anuj quit Radio City in July 2008, after the station changed its language mix to a more regional sound.

Podcast 
In 2021, Anuj published his own podcast - EdTalk with Anuj! A talk-show series focused on conversations around the Education system in India.

402,932718,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahakam%20River,Mahakam River,"The Mahakam River (Indonesian: Sungai Mahakam) is third longest and volume discharge river in Borneo after Kapuas River and Barito River, it is located in Kalimantan, Indonesia. It flows  from the district of Long Apari in the highlands of Borneo, to its mouth at the Makassar Strait.

The city of Samarinda, the provincial capital of East Kalimantan, lies along  from the river mouth.
The delta Mahakam river consist of specific micro climate which is influenced by high and low tide at sea level.

Summary
The Mahakam River  is the largest river in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a catchment area of approximately 77,100 km2. The catchment lies between 2˚N to 1˚S latitude and 113˚E to 118˚E longitude. The river originates in Cemaru from where it flows south-eastwards, meeting the River Kedang Pahu at the city of Muara Pahu. From there, the river flows eastward through the Mahakam lakes region, which is a flat tropical lowland area surrounded by peat land. Thirty shallow lakes are situated in this area, which are connected to the Mahakam through small channels . Downstream of the connection with the Semayang and Melintang lakes, the Mahakam meets three other main tributaries – the rivers Belayan, Kedang Kepala, and Kedang Rantau – and flows south-eastwards through the Mahakam delta distributaries, to the Makassar Strait.

Geology
Kalimantan, where the Mahakam lies, is part of the Sunda Continental Plate. The large island has mountain ranges between Indonesia and Malaysia. As described by van Bemmelen (1949), River Mahakam rises in Cemaru () in the center of Kalimantan, from there it cuts through the pre-tertiary axis of the island east of the Batuayan () and then reaches the tertiary basin of Kutai. Its middle course traverses a lowland plain with many marshy lakes. This intermontane depression is separated from the neighboring basin, the Barito depression, by a broad hilly tract of less than  altitude. After this region, the Mahakam cuts through the Samarinda anticlinorium and reaches its alluvial delta, which spreads like a broad fan over the shelf-sea, with a base of  and a radius of about .

Upstream of Long Iram (upstream part of Mahakam river basin) the river is flowing in tertiary rocks (Voss, 1983). Between Long Iram and Muara Kaman (middle Mahakam area) the river is flowing in quaternary alluvium, while in the downstream area between Muara Kaman and the coast including the Mahakam delta, tertiary rocks are again present. The presence of the large delta is explained by the formation and rejuvenation of the hilly region near Samarinda.

Climate
The Mahakam catchment is around the equator. The average annual rainfall in the catchment area is 3163 mm. The average runoff is around 1911 mm. According to Köppen climate classification, this area belongs to type Af (tropical rainforest) that has a minimum temperature ≥18 °C and precipitation of the driest month in normal year ≥60 mm Transfer of mass and energy in the tropical zone occurred through general air circulation known as the Hadley cell. According to Seidel et al. (2008) the precipitation pattern in this area is largely determined by this large-scale atmospheric wind patterns, which is observable in several ways throughout the atmosphere. This circulation carries moisture into the air, generating rainfall in equatorial regions, whereas at the edges of the tropical belt are drier. Within this circulation, evaporation occurs intensively around the equator on the center of low pressure called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), characterized by accumulation of cloud in the area. The ITCZ moves following the pseudo-motion of the sun within 23.5°N and 23.5°S zone, therefore its position always changes according to this motion.

The ITCZ drives the Indo-Australian monsoon phenomena which influence the regional climate including the Mahakam catchment. In December, January, February (winter in Northern Hemisphere) the concentration of high pressure in Asia and low pressure in Australia make the west wind blows in Indonesia (west monsoon). In June, July, August concentration of low pressure in Asia (summer in Northern Hemisphere) and concentration of high pressure in Australia make the east wind blows in Indonesia (east monsoon). Due to the global air circulation and the regional climate mentioned above, the Mahakam catchment which is located around the equator has a bimodal rainfall pattern with two peaks of rainfall, which are generally occurred in December and May. This is because the ITCZ passed through the equator twice a year, from the Northern Hemisphere in September and from the Southern Hemisphere in March.

Lakes

There are about 76 lakes spread in the Mahakam river basin and about 30 lakes are located in the middle Mahakam area including the three main lakes (Lake Jempang 15,000 Ha; Lake Semayang 13,000 Ha; Lake Melintang 11,000 Ha). The lakes levels are seasonally fluctuated from 0.5 m – 1 m during dry period to seven meters during rainy season. The Mahakam lakes and surrounding wetlands act as water storage  as well as a trap of sediment contained in the water flowing into the lakes which are now known to become shallower, presumably as a result of an imbalance between sediment input and slow subsidence.

Fishing is the primary source of livelihood in the Mahakam lakes area, most of the people around the lakes are fishermen. The middle Mahakam lake area is an area of intensive fishing activity with a productivity of 25,000 to 35,000 metric tons per year since 1970.

Delta

The Mahakam delta is a mixed fluvial-tidal dominated delta. The delta covers about , consisting of mangrove areas near the shore, Nypa swamps in the central areas, and lowland forest near the apex, corresponding to the first bifurcation. Fishery development in this area has converted a vast area of mangrove into shrimp ponds (tambak). However, recent mangrove restoration efforts have taken place in the delta by replanting mangroves in abandoned shrimp ponds and encouraging silvofishery. Many areas in the Mahakam delta are already naturally recolonized by mangrove vegetation contributing to ecosystem restoration. Mangroves also function as sedimentation enhancing strategies by capturing sediment causing accretion.

The delta has three main distributaries system directed Northeast, Southeast and South. The area between distributaries consists of a series of tidal channels generally unconnected to the main distributaries. The distributary channels are narrow and rectilinear with the depth ranging from  and distributary channel bifurcations appear every .

This lower Mahakam area is the second most productive hydrocarbon basin of Indonesia which contains around 3 billion barrels of oil and 30 Tcf of gas reserves. Field geological investigations in this area was started in 1888 and in 1897 exploration drilling discovered oil at shallow depth of  on the Louise structure. Production started in 1898 followed by expansion of exploration to the entire Mahakam.

Ecology

Mahakam and its floodplain is an ecologically important region. A total of 147 indigenous freshwater fish species had been identified from the Mahakam. The Mahakam hosts the freshwater dolphin Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris; called Pesut by local people) a critically endangered species, which is included on CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I. The Mahakam river basin is also an important breeding and resting place for 298 bird species, among them 70 protected and five endemic species: Borneo dusky mannikin (Lonchura fuscans), Borneo whistler (Pachycephala hypoxantha), Bornean peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron schleiermacheri), Bornean blue-flycatcher (Cyornis superbus) and Bornean bristlehead (Pityriasis gymnocephala).

A research cluster (): ""Upsetting the balance in the Mahakam Delta: past, present and future impacts of sea level rise, climate change, upstream controls and human intervention on sediment and mangrove dynamics"" extensively carry out research on the Mahakam. The cluster's objective is to study the impact of external forcing factors such as sea-level rise, climate change, upstream sediment, as well as human interference on past, present and future development of the Mahakam delta in different time scales.

Pollution
Logging and mining activities have contributed to the ""alarming rate"" of pollution of East Kalimantan's Mahakam River. Tests of water pollutants showed levels increased sharply between 2009 and 2011. Despite the growing pollution, it is claimed that ""the water is basically still safe for consumption.""

Unsafe concentrations of heavy metals have been observed in Mahakam fish. A 2015 study found lead concentrations in excess of 1000 times safe levels along with unsafe levels of copper, zinc, and cadmium.

Bridges
Bridges include the  Mahakam Bridge and the  Kutai Kartanegara Bridge. The latter collapsed on 26 November 2011, it took 3 years of planning and one and half years more to rebuild new bridge on the same spot. The new Kutai Kertanegara Bridge now open for public since 8 December 2015 after opening ceremony held by local regent.

Social aspect

The River Mahakam is an economic resource for fishermen and farmers, and as freshwater source, as a waterway since ancient time until today. It is in this river basin where the Kutai kingdom evolved. The Kutai history is divided into two periods, Kutai Martadipura (around 350–400 AD) and Kutai Kartanegara period (around 1300). Kutai Martadipura, a Hindu kingdom founded by Mulawarman at Muara Kaman, is regarded as the oldest kingdom in Indonesia. Kutai Kartanegara was founded by settlers from Java at Kutai Lama near the mouth of Mahakam. In around 1565, Islam was extensively spread in Kartanegara by two Moslem preachers from Java, Tunggang Parangan and Ri Bandang.

The Dayaks are the indigenous people inhabiting Kalimantan beside the Kutais and the Banjars. Since the 1970s transmigration of people to East Kalimantan was organized by the Indonesian government especially in areas near River Mahakam. Transmigration aims to migrate people from overpopulated Java, Bali, and Madura islands to stimulate greater agricultural productivity in outer islands. By 1973, almost 26% of the land under cultivation in East Kalimantan was being worked by transmigrants.

405,1234864,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC%20Succession,RC Succession,"was an influential Japanese rock band from Tokyo, formed in 1968. One of Japan's longest-running bands, it went through many line-up changes over the years with front man Kiyoshiro Imawano and bassist Kazuo Kobayashi the only constant members, before disbanding in January 1991. The origins of the group's name remain obscure, but according to some it is a mispronunciation of an in-joke among the band members.

In 2003, HMV Japan ranked RC Succession at No. 16 on their list of the ""Top 100 Japanese Pops Artists"". In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated their 1980 live album Rhapsody at No. 2 and their 1988 cover album Covers at No. 41 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time"". Covers was named number 1 on Bounces 2009 list of ""54 Standard Japanese Rock Albums"".

History 
In 1966, Imawano formed a band named the Clover with Kenchi Haren. This band broke up the following year, however, the remaining members added some new members and called it the Remainders of the Clover. This band changed members again in 1968, and this time they were renamed to The Remainders of the Clover Succession. The name was shortened and the band RC Succession was born. The group first started as a Tokyo-based folk trio in 1966 when leader Kiyoshiro Imawano was still in junior high school and playing in a Ventures copy band. The group is hard to classify, but in early years their sound was mostly R&B fashioned music played acoustically. Imawano, however, has quite a distinctive high warbling voice that is not typical of soul singers. More than a singer, he is known as a lyricist for his clever and timely lyrics. RC Succession developed a reputation early on as a strong live band, but did not have a hit record until 1972, and then not again for a long time after that. In the late 70s the group took on a more electric sound, as well as an odd glam influenced look, with Imawano in particular often appearing in loud clothing and heavy makeup. The group became part of a hot late 70s scene which included Yellow Magic Orchestra, The Plastics, and Sandii & The Sunsetz, created when these groups began interacting with foreign bands and releasing internationally. RC Succession did not catch on internationally as much as some of the others.

In 1970, RC Succession made its debut as an acoustic trio of Kiyoshiro Imawano (vo., gt.), Wassho Rinko (another name for Kazuo Kobayashi) (b.) and Kenchi Haren (gt.). After guitarist Reichi ""Chabo"" Nakaido joined the band in 1978 replacing Haren, their popularity grew as they strengthened their rock and roll sound. Since then, they released series of milestone numbers including ""Ameagari no Yozora Ni"" (1980) and ""Transistor Radio"" (1980).

in 1982, the band enter in part of a famous concert in 1982 called ""The Day of R&B"", which took place at a packed baseball stadium and included as headliners Chuck Berry and Sam Moore of Sam & Dave. The event was filmed and released as a video. Another thing in 1982 that helped establish them as a major act was a collaboration with Ryucihi Sakamoto called ""Ikenai Rouge Magic"". The single's jacket and promotional picture featured Imawano and Sakamoto kissing - quite a shocker at the time. The song was also used in a popular TV commercial. Among the best-known RC Succession songs are ""Ameagari No Yozora Ni"" and ""Toranjisuta Rajio"". RC Succession have often collaborated with other artists, and Imawano marks among the highlights of his career working with his heroes Booker T. & The MG's. RC Succession are also unusual in that for a Japanese pop band they are fairly political and outspoken. They are one of the few Japanese bands that regularly play benefits, and Imawano has spoken out against war, 
nuclear power and in favor of Tibetan freedom.

In 1988, the band recorded an album consisting of cover versions of rock and pop standards (with original Japanese lyrics) aptly named Covers. It was originally intended for a release from the band's record company Toshiba EMI, however, the release was suddenly canceled with small notice by Toshiba EMI on newspapers claiming ""The album was too wonderful to be released."" Two months later in August 1988, it was released by Kitty Records. Kiyoshiro revealed that there had been pressure from Toshiba to remove some of the anti-war and anti-nuclear songs from the album. The album gained wide attention due to the incident, and debuted at number one of the Oricon album chart.

The members Gee2Woo (keyboards) and Kozo Niida (drums) left the band in 1990. The remaining members Kiyoshiro, Nakaido, and Kazuo Kobayashi (bass) with some supporting musicians released the album Baby a Go-Go that year, but the band later announced that they would stop performing. The last concert was given at Nippon Budokan on December 25, 1990.

After they stopped performing, Kiyoshiro and Nakaido continued as solo artists, while other members (Kobayashi, Niida, and Gee2Woo) resumed their careers as session players. While the band never played together again, Kiyoshiro and Nakaido kept close relationships and collaborated from time to time, including the 1994 album Glad All Over which was credited to Kiyoshiro Imawano & Reichi Nakaido.

Kiyoshiro died of cancer on May 2, 2009.

Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.

408,19627518,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyko%20Kama,Nyko Kama,"The Nyko Kama is a third-party Nunchuk accessory created for the Wii video game console by Nyko, available in wireless or wired versions. In contrast to Nintendo's device, the controller takes its name from the traditional Japanese kama; a stealthy, curved weapon. Like the original Nunchuk, the Kama features an analog control stick, and ""Z"" and ""C"" buttons. With the use of 2 AAA batteries and an adapter dongle that plugs into the Wii Remote's expansion port, the wireless Kama is able to connect wirelessly. The wired version instead features a rumble motor, which allows it to offer force feedback when used with Nyko's Wand Wii Remote alternative.

History
When first announced in late 2007, the Kama was simply dubbed the ""Wireless Nunchuck"". It was given its final name shortly before its release, upon which IGN observed that Nyko had ""molded the Kama body very much along the lines of the Nunchuck's curves and ergonomics, and at first grasp the two feel nearly identical."" Likewise, CNET said that ""the only real difference between the Kama and original are the C and Z trigger buttons, which have gotten a nice transparent makeover. The joystick, however, is nearly identical.""

In mid-2008, Nyko were sued by Nintendo over the controller, who asserted that the Kama ""wholly appropriate[d] the novel shape, design, overall appearance and even the color and materials used in the Nintendo Nunchuk controller."" A spokesman for Nyko said at the time that they ""[had] not knowingly violated anyone's intellectual property"". The case was ultimately settled, with Nyko pledging to continue selling a redesigned version of the Kama. No further terms of the settlement were disclosed, but Gizmodo speculated Nyko had paid a ""sizable"" amount to Nintendo.

According to a Nyko spokesman, the redesign of the Kama entailed a wider shape, curved Z button, a grooved handle, rubber battery cover and a new color scheme. Alongside the redesigned wireless Kama, Nyko unveiled a wired version which added a rumble motor, a feature not included in previous Nunchuks, first-party or otherwise. This requires the use of Nyko's Wand controllers, due to its reliance on their proprietary ""Trans-Port Technology"".

409,41778766,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain%20rationing%20in%20China,Grain rationing in China,"The grain rationing system in China was imposed by the People's Republic of China in the 1950s to control the production of food and to boost industrialization. People were given grain coupons with which they could buy a certain amount of grain at a low, state-imposed price, which varied somewhat with age, profession and location. Any quantity exceeding the coupon quota would have to be purchased at market price. Urban households in China therefore face a kinked budget constraint line. With this system, urban households were able to buy grain at a cheaper price, and at the same time rural areas, once they fulfilled the state-imposed quotas, were allowed to sell the excess supply at market price.

Historical setting
Since the birth of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China has undergone several economic transformations. Gradual reforms have shifted agricultural production in rural areas from private farming to collectivization and lastly back to household production. This is seen in two main policy eras: central planning from the 1950s until 1978, and decentralization after 1978.

During central planning, the government aimed to boost industrialization and growth in urban areas, enforcing policies to secure enough food from the rural areas. The state held a monopoly and therefore set both agricultural and industrial prices. Low food prices (prices set below market price) determined low wages in the countryside, which in turn allowed the state to achieve higher gains in the urban industries and to reinvest them. Through this system, money was 'extracted’ from the countryside in order to finance industrialization in the urban areas.

In the 1950s, communes were established in rural areas and the government imposed ‘procurement planning’, which required peasants to deliver a certain amount of food to the state at state-imposed prices. However, demand exceeded supply and the agricultural sector became very inefficient. The government tried to solve this problem by introducing a grain rationing system, combining consumer rationing and compulsory purchases from producers.
The gradual development of a free market put an end to the rationing system and introduced dual prices. This is where the price scissors phenomena emerged.

Grain rationing system
Figures assume that there are only two sectors (rural and urban) producing two goods (manufactures and food) and that the supply of the two goods is fixed. The amount of food that a peasant household will sell in exchange for manufactured goods can also be shown.

To solve the price scissors problem, China imposed production quotas on rural households, and urban wages were set low in order to maintain low urban food demand. In the 1950s, the grain rationing system was put in place, in which urban families were given grain coupons. The amount that the urban households could purchase was the relative price between grain and other goods, and was determined by the state. Any consumption that exceeded this could be purchased, but at the market price.

It peaked at No. 30 on the UK Albums Chart, aided by the success of the album's third single, ""Living on the Ceiling"", released the following month, which became Blancmange's breakthrough hit, reaching No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. A re-recorded version of the album, titled Happy Families Too..., was released in 2013.

Release
Initial pressings of the album in 1982 contained the original version of ""Waves"" – on later pressings and on the subsequent CD issues this version was replaced by the 7"" single version, which had been remixed by Denis Weinrich and the band's manager John Owen Williams, and included re-recorded vocals and a string section arranged by Linton Naiff. The original version remained unavailable on any format until its inclusion on the 2012 compilation album The Very Best of Blancmange. The Canadian release of the album had a slightly rearranged running order and included a special mix of the song ""Blind Vision"", released as a single in May 1983 and which appeared on the group's second album Mange Tout in the UK in 1984.

In 2008 Edsel Records reissued Happy Families as a remastered and expanded version titled Happy Families... Plus. This version of the album added six bonus tracks to the original ten-track album: the extended versions of the singles ""God's Kitchen"", ""Feel Me"" and ""Living on the Ceiling""; two instrumental mixes of ""Feel Me""; and the instrumental track ""Business Steps"" (originally the B-side of ""Waves""). However, Happy Families... Plus featured the 7"" single versions of not just ""Waves"" but also ""Living on the Ceiling"", rather than the original album versions.

Melody Maker flexidisc
Excerpts of the songs ""Living on the Ceiling"" and ""Sad Day"" featured on one side of a flexidisc given away free with the issue of Melody Maker dated 24 April 1982. The other side of the disc featured the song ""Born Every Minute"" by The Passage.

Critical reception

Critical reception for Happy Families was mixed, with some reviewers feeling the album trod a sometimes unsuccessful path between experimental aspirations and commercial sensibilities. Melody Maker stated that ""touting the chalk and cheese, odd couple image, [Arthur and Luscombe]'s misfit marriage of experimentalism and unprepossessing pop was always in grave danger of belittling itself into an English Eighties parody of Sparks, parodying Joy Division, aping Depeche Mode... Happy Families, their debut album, is every bit the entertaining disappointment that anyone familiar with Blancmange's nervous live shows had a right to expect... Their brave schizophrenia is invariably self-defeating, their adventurously varied song treatments befuddling where a more open, honest approach could have unearthed brilliance.""

NME said that ""Happy Families is a calmly assured collection of work: maybe not stamped with greatness, quite, but there's not a number in the whole ten that's without appeal, intelligence and warmth... There's impressive, though never overstated, drama in their delivery and winning ingenuity in their arrangements: a nicely controlled excitement... the flaws are minor and the merits are major."" Smash Hits felt that the album ""occupies a curious no-man's land between near criminal stylistic nicking from a cast of thousands (everyone from OMD to Yazoo, from Simple Minds to Talking Heads) and [the] nagging near-certainty that the guilty pair have real talent... meanwhile their good taste in pilfering is well worth investigating.""

416,52882803,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre%20Michelin%20%28businessman%29,Pierre Michelin (businessman),"Pierre Michelin (1903 - 30 December 1937) was a joint head of the Michelin tyre company between 1933 and his early death at the end of 1937, and president of the Citroën car company between September 1935 and 1937.

Life
Pierre Michelin was the younger of his father's two recorded sons.   He only became a director of the family company after 1932 following the death in a flying accident of his elder brother, Étienne Michelin.   He was sent to  Citroën car company in 1935.   Citroën had filed for bankruptcy in November 1934 when one of its creditors, a steering wheel supplier, applied to the court to enforce payment of a debt.   As Citroën's supplier of tyres it was Michelin that was that company's largest creditor.   In January 1935 André Citroën, already suffering from the cancer that would kill him a few months later, offered Michelin options to acquire a large block of voting shares in the business as additional security for the monies owed for tyres.   With his father otherwise preoccupied,  Pierre Michelin jumped at the opportunity, and by the end of January 1935 Michelin controlled more than 50% of the voting capital in Citroën.   Pierre Michelin became president of Citroën in July 1935 when André Citroën died, but by that time he was already running the company, cutting back on wasteful management practices and applying the type of detailed control already in place at the main Michelin plant in Clermont-Ferrand.

The immediate priority was the Citroën Traction Avant for which massive investment in production capacity had been necessary and which had been launched in April 1934 before all the gremlins in the design had been addressed in order to generate desperately needed revenue.   Although the revolutionary unitary bodyshell was, according to most reports, not affected by the rushed launch schedule, problems with transmission joints and the hydraulic brakes – another ""first"" in a volume car in Europe – reflected the financial pressure to get the car into production as quickly as possible.  Pierre Michelin's period at the head of the company saw the correction of early teething troubles on what became a successful and ultimately very profitable model for the company.

The Citroën acquisition which Pierre Michelin led marked the beginning of a defining partnership for both companies that would last for more than forty years.

In the political world there are persistent suspicions that Pierre Michelin had financial links with a cell of the neo-fascist Cagoule movement.   France under the Popular Front government was undergoing a surge in nationalist extremism and industrial unrest at this time, but during the ensuing decades the suspicions involving Pierre Michelin never progressed beyond the status of rumor.

Death
On 29 December 1937, while driving his Citroën Traction near Montargis on the main road to the south, Pierre Michelin was involved in a fatal collision.   The other car involved was a Peugeot, driven by Louis Lagorgette, the principal private secretary of the politician Paul Faure.   Lagorgette, his wife and his son all died at the scene of the accident.   Pierre Michelin died at the hospital in Montargis the next day, soon after undergoing an operation for the amputation of his right leg.

Pierre-Jules Boulanger was left to run Citroën without his friend, something he accomplished with flair and success for the next thirteen years.   A sad parallel came in 1950 when Boulanger himself died at Broût-Vernet, Allier, also in a car crash in a Citroën Traction Avant, on Sunday, 12 November 1950, while on the main road between Clermont-Ferrand (the home of Michelin) and Paris.

417,3616828,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muir%20S.%20Fairchild,Muir S. Fairchild,"General Muir Stephen Fairchild (September 2, 1894 – March 17, 1950) was a United States Air Force officer and the service's second Vice Chief of Staff.

Early service
Born in Bellingham, Washington, Fairchild moved to Olympia in 1905 when his father was appointed by Governor Meade as chairman of Washington's first Railroad Commission. Muir graduated from Olympia High School (officially William Winlock Miller High School) in 1913, then entered the U.S. Army's Signal Corps in 1913 in an Army Signal Corps reserve unit in Seattle, while he was a student at the University of Washington. In 1916, he was deployed in the Washington National Guard with the rank of sergeant, and his unit joined in the search for Pancho Villa along the Mexican border, where he spent much time in a horse saddle in the desert heat.  Watching observation planes flying overhead in the United States' first armed conflict using airplanes, Fairchild was an easy recruit when flyboys were being sought to fight with the French and Italians in the developing war in Europe, before the U.S. entered World War I. A year later Fairchild became a flying cadet at Berkeley, California, getting his wings and commission in the U.S. Army's Aviation Section in January 1918. Fairchild fought the Germans from the air over the Rhine, including night bombing missions, in an era when bombs were still being released from the hand grasp of the bombardier.

Between the wars
In December 1918 Fairchild returned home and served at McCook Field, Ohio; Mitchel Field, New York, and Langley Field, Virginia. On October 20, 1922 he was practicing dog fighting with Lt. Harold Ross Harris; when Harris plane went out of control and Harris was forced to parachute his way to safety; ironically nearly a year later August 22, 1923 both Harris and Fairchild piloted the US Military first heavy bomber the Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1.

In 1926 and 1927, he flew to South America as part of the Pan American Good Will Flight a  pioneering flight that sought to promote air postal service, U.S. commercial aviation and take messages of friendship to the governments and people of Central and South America, while forging aerial navigation routes through the Americas. The flight originated with five aircraft and crews taking off from Kelly Field, Texas on December 21, 1926, seeking to land in 23 Central and South American countries.

The aircraft used for the journey were new observation planes, the Loening OA-1A that could be used as both landplanes and seaplanes, with Liberty engines and a wood interior structure with an aluminum-covered fuselage and fabric-covered wings. Each plane was named for a U.S. city and crewed by two pilots, one of whom was an engineering officer, since there were very few airfields or repair facilities along the route, with the crew choosing the motto ""No Work, No Ride.""

Crew of the New York: Maj. Herbert Dargue, Lt. Ennis Whitehead;
Crew of the San Antonio: Capt. Arthur McDaniel, Lt. Charles Robinson;
Crew of the San Francisco: Capt. Ira Eaker, Lt. Muir Fairchild;
Crew of the Detroit: Capt. Clinton F. Woolsey, Lt. John Benton;
Crew of the St. Louis: Lt. Bernard Thompson, Lt. Leonard Weddington

The flight was marred by tragedy when the Detroit and New York accidentally collided mid-air and got locked together. The crew of the New York were able to parachute to safety but Capt. Woolsley and Lt. Benton were killed when the Detroit hit the ground.

The Pan American Flyers were greeted by a cheering crowd including President Calvin Coolidge, Cabinet members, and diplomats from Central and Latin America when they returned to Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., on May 2, 1927.

Fairchild and the rest of the surviving Pan American Flight crew, and Charles Lindbergh, were among the first nine aviators to receive the newly created award Distinguished Flying Cross. The Pan Am Good Will Tour aviators were the first to be named to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross, Lindbergh's being named came after the Pan Am Good Will Tour members, though Lindbergh actually received his medal first.

Fairchild went on to complete the course in the Air Corps Engineer School at Wright Field in June 1929 and went to Santa Monica, California, as Air Corps representative to Douglas Aircraft Corporation. In June 1935 he graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School, along with strategic bombing advocates Haywood S. Hansell, Barney Giles, Vernon M. Guymon, Laurence S. Kuter, Lawson H. M. Sanderson and Hoyt S. Vandenberg, then became an Air Corps Tactical School instructor. He later attended the Army Industrial College, and the Army War College. He rose to director of air tactics and strategy in 1939.

Second World War

In 1940, Fairchild went to the Plans Division in Washington and in 1941 was named secretary of the newly formed Air Staff. Two months later he was advanced two grades to brigadier general and named assistant chief of Air Corps. In 1942 he became director of military requirements and was promoted to major general in August. In November he became a member of the Joint Strategic Survey Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Post war
In January 1946, he was named commandant of Air University at Maxwell Field in Alabama, with promotion to lieutenant general. On May 27, 1948, he became the second vice chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, with the rank of general. General Fairchild died of a heart attack at his quarters at Fort Myer on March 17, 1950, while still on active duty as vice chief of staff at the Pentagon. He was survived by his wife, Florence Alice Fairchild, and his daughter, Betsy Anne Calvert.

Legacy
Fairchild Hall, the main academic building at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado, and the library at the Air University in Alabama, Fairchild Memorial Hall, were named for him. In his home state of Washington, Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane was named for him shortly after his death. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

418,44501940,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%20of%20Boca%20Juniors,History of Boca Juniors,"Origins of Argentine sports club Boca Juniors can be traced to the early 1900s, when a group of Italian immigrants decided to establish a football club in Buenos Aires. They were descendants from the first Italian (most of them from the city of Genoa) that had set in La Boca during the late 19th century. Because of that, the nickname Xeneizes is a derivative form of ""Genoveses"" (in Spanish, it refers to people from Genoa).

During the first years of its existence, the club developed a strong rivalry with then neighbor team River Plate, that would continue through the years, despite River Plate soon left La Boca to establish itself in Belgrano. In the 20th century, Boca consolidated as one of the most popular and successful clubs in Argentina, giving its first step in 1913 when the team promoted to Primera División.

Although Boca Juniors won its first official title in 1919 (the Primera División championship), the first milestone in the history of the club came in 1925 with the successful tour to Europe, where Boca Juniors played 19 matches winning 15 of them. That tour was not the first time an Argentine team played abroad but also helped Boca increase considerably its number of fans along Argentina. Besides, the term player number 12 was used for the first time during that tour.

Before La Bombonera was opened in 1940, Boca Juniors played its home venues at many locations, with its first field located in Dársena Sud (south of current Puerto Madero neighborhood). Other locations include fields in Isla Demarchi, and Wilde in Avellaneda Partido. The first stadium in La Boca was at Ministro Brin and Senguel streets which lasted until 1924 when the club moved to Brandsen and Del Crucero.

Although football was the main interest of the club (and the sport which the club is mostly renowned for) at the moment of having been founded, Boca Juniors also added other sports, most notably basketball (which team has won several titles since the section was created in 1929), and volleyball. In football, Boca Juniors is considered one of the ""Big Five"" since 1937 when the Argentine Football Association (AFA) arranged a system of proportional representation for the affiliated clubs.

Italian immigration to Argentina

By 1905, Buenos Aires was a city of only 900,000 inhabitants. A significant part of them were Italian immigrants, that had arrived en masse from 1870 to 1920 with a peak between 1900 and 1915. The majority of them established in the Buenos Aires Province, working in a large range of occupations such as agriculture, craft, commerce, among others.

By 1914 the 50% of the immigrants who came to Argentina were Italian.

Italian immigrants living in La Boca tried to keep their customs and social practices. The ""cantinas"" were the places where they used to meet and dance the typical Italian rhythms. The dishes were also brought from their country of origin, such as pizza and pasta.

Italian influence is still visible in Argentina, with Lunfardo, the jargon enshrined in tango lyrics, laden with Italianisms, often also found in the mainstream colloquial dialect (Rioplatense Spanish). Common dishes with Italian names and origins (milanesa, fainá, polenta,  pascualina) were adopted by Argentina and nowadays they are recognizable dishes of the local gastronomy.

Foundation 

On April 1, 1905, a group of boys that had been part of a football team, ""Independencia Sud"", met in a bench of Plaza Solís of La Boca with the purpose of establishing a team. They were Esteban Baglietto, Santiago Scarpatti, Santiago Sana, and brothers Juan and Teodoro Farenga. As they didn't reach an agreement, a new meeting was called for the next day. In a new meeting on April 3, they finally agreed and the first committee was established, with Baglietto as president. After several names were proposed, ""Boca"" (for the neighborhood) was chosen, adding ""Juniors"" to it after a suggestion by Sana, to highlight to name. The use of English language in football team names was commonplace, as British railway workers had originally introduced football into Argentina.

Plaza Solís, seat of the first meeting, is recognized today as the place where Boca Juniors was established.

Baglietto, Sana and Scarpatti had received football lessons by Patrick ""Paddy"" McCarthy an Irish footballer and boxer who came to Argentina in 1900 and taught football techniques to immigrants' children, as an appointed member of the sports municipal committee in Buenos Aires.

Other important founders members include Arturo Penney, Marcelino Vergara, Luis Cerezo, Adolfo Taggio, Giovanelli, Donato Abbatángelo, Bertolini.

Early years 
The first field of the club was placed on the square block formed by Pedro de Mendoza, Colorado (A. Caffarena today), Sengüel (B. Pérez Galdós) and Gaboto streets in ""Dársena Sud"", while the headquarters located on Pinzón street (then moved to Suárez street). On April 21, 1905, Boca Juniors played its first match, beating Mariano Moreno 4–0, with goals scored by Juan Farenga (2), José Farenga and Sana. The starting line-up was: Esteban Baglietto (founder and president); José Farenga (founder and treasurer), Santiago Sana, Vicente Oñate, Guillermo Tyler, Luis De Harenne, Alfredo Scarpatti (secretary), Pedro Moltedo (captain), Amadeo Gelsi (vice-president), Alberto Tallent and Juan Farenga (founder). In that match, the team wore a white shirt with black stripes, hand-stitched by Manuela, sister of the Farenga. That shirt was worn in several matches until it was replaced by a light blue one. Nevertheless, some versions state that the first jersey was pink and was worn only for the first two games, although there are no any solid evidence that can prove this.

In August 1905, Boca registered to play in Copa Villalobos, where the team made a poor performance losing most of games. One of its rivals was Club Atlético Independiente. After the frustrating experience in Villalobos, Boca Juniors registered to another ligue, ""Liga Central"" in 1906, where the team would win its first title, being awarded the ""Copa Reformista Trophy"". Boca played 18 matches, winning 15 and remaining unbeaten.

In 1907 the club played two matches in Liga Central before switching to ""Asociación Porteña de Foot-Ball"". Some sources state that Boca wore the blue and gold colors for the first time on August 4, v General Arenales (Boca won 1–0). Those colors came after a suggestion from former club's president (and port worker) Juan Brichetto, taking the colors of the flag of the first ship he allowed to cross on the following morning. As the first ship that crossed the bridge was Swedish, Boca Juniors took those colors. It is believed that it was the 4146-ton freighter ""Drottning Sophia"", a Swedish vessel sailing from Copenhagen, although other historians say that the Drottning Sophia did not arrive in Buenos Aires in 1907 but in 1905. The ship that gave it colors to Boca Juniors would have probably been the Oskar II of Nordstjernan/Johnson Line, arriving to the port on February 5, 1907. The first design with those colors was blue with a diagonal gold sash.

In Asociación Porteña, Boca reached the final v Araneles, losing the playoff 1–0 after the first match (won by Boca 4–1) was annulled and the second ended in a 3–3 tie. In September, Boca registered in Liga Albión, where one of its rivals was Santa Rosa (predecessor of then arch-rival River Plate). That year, Boca played its first international match, v Uruguayan club Universal from Montevideo, on December 8, 1907. Universal won 1–0.

Boca Juniors played the 1907 Copa Albión final v San Telmo in 1908, winning 4–1 and therefore achieving its second title, being awarede the ""Copa Barone Trophy"".

AFA affiliation 

In 1908 Boca Juniors affiliated to the Argentine Football Association to play in Segunda División, the second division of Argentine football by then. Boca Juniors' debut in official tournaments was on May 3, 1908, when the squad defeated Belgrano A.C. II by 3–1 in the stadium of Virrey del Pino and Superí of Belgrano neighborhood. Boca Juniors starting line-up for that historic match was: Juan de los Santos; Marcelino Vergara, Luis Cerezo; Guillermo Ryan, Alberto Penney, Juan Priano; Arturo Penney, Manuel Eloiso, Rafael Pratt, Pedro Moltedo, José María Farenga. Goals were scored by Pratt (2) and Eloiso. The squad finished in first place (among eight teams) and qualified for the next stage, the semifinal, where Boca was beat by Racing Club 1–0.

On August 2, the first Superclásico (friendly) was played, with Boca winning 2–1. Nevertheless, some sources state that there were previous matches between both clubs. That same year Boca Juniors played its first Copa Bullrich, a competition contested by Segunda División clubs. Boca was eliminated by Atlanta (then champion) in the second stage after being beat 5–0.

In 1909 Boca made a poor campaign, finishing 3rd in its zone. Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires promoted to Primera División. In 1910 Boca Juniors made a good campaign winning 15 matches with only 3 losses. Boca played another semifinal against Racing Club but it lost 2–1 (at GEBA) and could not promote to the first division.

In 1911, División Intermedia is created as the second level of Argentine football, with Boca Juniors as one of its teams. The club made a poor campaign with only 7 wins and 8 loses, almost being relegated. Pedro Calomino (who became the first idol in the history of the club) debuted during this competition.

Boca left its field in 1912 to move to Costanera Sur, where the Naval Observatory is located nowadays. As a result of the first schism in the Association, dissident body Federación Argentina de Football is established, causing that only a few clubs remained to play a championship. Boca would be promoted to the first Division –among other teams– the next year.

The coming to Primera División and ""Superclásico""

In 1913 Boca earned the promotion to Primera División that the team had wanted for many years. This was possible when the Asociación Argentina de Fútbol decided to increase the number of teams in the league from 6 to 15. The other teams that went to Primera were Ferro Carril Oeste, Platense, Banfield, Olivos, Comercio, Ferrocarril Sud and Riachuelo.

Boca Juniors finished 5th. at its first season in Primera División, playing a total of 14 matches. The team won 8, lost 4 and drew 2, scoring 29 goals and conceding 16. The next season Boca Juniors finished 3rd. of 13 teams. The 1915 championship the team decreased its performance dramatically, finishing 14th. of 25, also suffering thrashing defeats at the hands of Racing Club (0–6) and San Isidro, the two best teams of the tournament. The defeat to San Isidro remains as the worst defeat ever in official matches.

The first official match between Boca Juniors and arch-rival River Plate, known as Superclásico, was played in the 1913 Primera División championship at Racing Club stadium, being won by River Plate by 2–1. Boca had previously played against River in other unofficial matches, but the exact dates are still under dispute. The most extended version affirms that the first Superclásico ever was played on August 2, 1908, with Boca Juniors being the winner by 2–1, although there are no documents that support the information. Other version state that the first recorded match was played in 1912.

First titles and success

In 1919, the Association expelled 7 clubs (while other 6 disaffiliated from the body to form Asociación Amateurs de Football), annulling the championship in progress and organised another competition with only 6 teams, Boca Juniors among them.

Boca Juniors won its first title ever (the 1919 Primera División championship). The team won all the matches played, scoring 29 goals and only conceding 5. The starting line-up for the last round was: Tesoriere; Cortella, Ortega; López, Busso, Elli; Calomino, Bozzo, Garasini, Martín, Miranda. It was played at Boca Juniors stadium, where Boca beat Sp. Almagro 4–0 (Martín and Miranda, two goals each).

That same year Boca won three titles else, national cups Copa de Competencia Jockey Club and Copa Ibarguren (both vs. the same rival and score: Rosario Central, 1–0) and the last edition of international Tie Cup (defeating Uruguayan team Nacional 2–0 at Estadio Sportivo Barracas (goals by Miranda and Bozzo). Because of those achievements, 1919 remains as the most successful season in club's history, having won 4 titles (1 league, 2 domestic cups and 1 international).

The 1920 decade was also one of the most successful for the club, winning 9 titles. The second (and consecutive) league title in 1920, when in round 18th. Boca thrashed Nueva Chicago 7–0 on December 19. Boca played a total of 24 games with 20 won and only 1 loss.

In 1923 Boca won its third Primera División title, in a championship where 4 matches had to be played to decide which team (Boca or Huracán) would be the champion, so Boca won the first game but was defeated in the 2nd leg; the 3rd match finished in a tie, therefore, a 4th game had to be played (at Estadio Sportivo Barracas stadium, on 27 April 1924), finally won by Boca 2–0 thus winning the title. Both goals were scored by Garasini. The line-up was: Tesoriere; Bidoglio, Muttis; Médici, Busso, Elli; Calomino, Cerrotti, Garasini, Pozzo, Pertini. In 1923, Boca also won the 1920 edition of Copa de Honor Cousenier to Universal FC 2–0 in Montevideo, becoming the first title won outside Argentina. Line up was: Tesoriere; Bidoglio, Muttis; Médici, Busso, Elli; Calomino, Cerrotti, Tarasconi, Pertini, Filiberti (goals by Pertini and Tarasconi).

Also in 1923 Boca also won its second Copa Ibarguren after defeating Rosario Central (the same team that Boca had beaten in 1919) 1–0 at Sportivo Barracas. The line-up was: Tesoriere; Bidoglio, Muttis; Médici, Coverto, Elli; Calomino, Cerrotti, Tarasconi, Pozzo, Pertini.

Boca was the unbeaten champion of the 1924 season, winning 18 matches out of 19. The team finished with a total of 67 goals scored (an average of 3.52 per game) and only conceded 8. That same year Boca Juniors won its third Copa Dr. Ibarguren after thrashing Rosario Central by 5–1 at Chacarita Juniors stadium.

European tour: ""Champion of Honour""

In 1925 Boca made its first trip to Europe to play at Spain, Germany and France. The squad played a total of 19 games, winning 15 of them. Some of the rivals defeated were Real Madrid, Celta de Vigo and Deportivo La Coruña. On 28 June 1926, in a meeting held at the Association Argentina de Football, Boca Juniors was declared ""Campeón de Honor"" (Champion of Honour) of 1925 season, and each member of the team received a commemorative medal. The players were: Tesoriere, Bidoglio, Muttis, Tarasconi, Busso, Elli, Médici, Garasini, Antraygues, Cerroti, Pertini and Posso.

After the successful tour of Europe, Boca Juniors returned to the local competitions, winning its 5th. Primera División championship in 1926, having finished unbeaten (same as 1924 season) after 17 games played. Boca Juniors and Independiente were to play-off for the unified title following the unification of the two leagues (Asociación Argentina de Football and Asociación Amateurs de Football), but after their match (played on 20 February 1927) was halted due to a spectator invasion, and a replay on 3 March 1927, finished 0–0, no further match was played due to the start of the new season. Boca not only won the league championship but another edition of the Copa de Competencia Jockey Club, defeating Argentinos Juniors in the second match after the first game had finished drawn.

In 1926 Boca Juniors won another national cup, the Copa Estímulo (played while the Argentina national football team played at the South American championship) defeating Sportivo Balcarce by 3–0 at the final.

The line-up for that match was: Yustrich; Domingos, Valussi; Vernieres, Lazzatti, Arico Suárez; Tenorio, Benítez Cáceres, Varallo, Cherro, Garibaldi.

During the decade of the 1930s, some footballers such as Juan Yustrich (nicknamed El Pez Volador -The Flying Fish), Pedro Arico Suárez, Delfín Benítez Cáceres, Domingo Tarasconi, Roberto Cherro and Francisco Varallo were not only big stars but Boca Juniors great idols.

The 1940s

During this period, Boca won three league championships in the 1940s, the same as the previous decade. The first title was obtained in 1940, the same year that La Bombonera was inaugurated. The key match was against Independiente, which Boca won 5–2 therefore crowning champion. The line-up was: Estrada; Ibáñez, Marante; A. López, Lazzatti, Arico Suárez; Sas, Carniglia, Sarlanga, Gandulla, Emeal. Boca won 24 games, drew 7 and lost 3.

The game was played in River Plate stadium (because the Bombonera had been temporarily closed due to hooliganism incidents). Over 19 games Boca Juniors won 19, with 8 draws and 3 losses. The line-up for that match vs. Racing is still remembered as one of the greatest Boca all-time teams: Vacca; Marante, Valussi; Sosa, Lazzatti, Pescia; Boyé, Corcuera, Sarlanga, S. Varela, Sánchez. During that season, Boca also remained unbeated for 26 consecutive matches, which was a record in the professional era until Racing broke this landmark when playing 39 matches without being defeated in 1966.

On 9 December 1962, Boca won a legendary match defeating River Plate 1–0, with the highlight being goalkeeper Antonio Roma stopping a penalty shot by Delem when only 6 minutes were left till the end of the match. Boca finally won its first title of the decade in the next fixture with a great victory (4–0) over Estudiantes de La Plata, becoming new champion. During the 1960s, Boca Juniors won 5 championships.

The following title obtained was in 1964, with Antonio Roma not conceding a goal for 742 minutes, and conceding only one goal in 14 matches. In 1965 Boca became successive champions for the 3rd time in the professional era. The key matches were the victory over River Plate (2–1) and Atlanta in the last fixture.

In the 1968 Metropolitano championship during a Superclásico that ended 0–0, seventy-one Boca Juniors supporters died after being squashed against an exit door at River Plate Stadium, which remained closed at the moment of the fans left the stadium.

The Xeneizes totalized 29 points, winning 13, with 3 draws and only 1 defeat and were coached by Alfredo Di Stéfano.

1970s: the second ""Golden Age""

In 1970 Boca won another title defeating Rosario Central in the final match of the Nacional tournament. In 1976 Juan Carlos Lorenzo arrived at the club. He would become one of the most successful coaches in the history of Boca Juniors, winning 5 official titles within 3 years. First of them was the 1976 Metropolitano, which Boca obtained after defeating Unión de Santa Fe by 2–0, one round before the end of the tournament.

The following tournament (1976 Nacional) Boca played a historic final match against arch-rival River Plate, winning 1–0 through a direct free kick goal scored by Rubén Suñé. Boca Juniors line-up was Gatti; Pernía, Sá, Mouzo, Tarantini; Ribolzi, Suñé, Veglio; Mastrángelo, Taverna, Felman (Zanabria). It was the only final played by both Superclásico teams up to present days.

That championship qualified Boca Juniors to play the 1977 Copa Libertadores, having reached the final match against Cruzeiro. After a victory 1–0 in Buenos Aires and a defeat in Belo Horizonte by the same score, it was necessary to play a third game, held in Estadio Centenario in Montevideo where Boca finally obtained the Libertadores for the first time, after a dramatic penalty shoot-out where Hugo Gatti stopped the last shot by Brazilian player Vanderley after the match ended 0–0.

1980s: The Maradona revolution and few titles

After a campaign in 1980 where the team was managed by club legend Antonio Rattín, the highlight of the 1980s was the acquisition of prodigious Diego Maradona, who came to the club along with Miguel Brindisi, Osvaldo Escudero, and Marcelo Trobbiani, while another club legend, Silvio Marzolini, was appointed as coach. Boca won its first title of the decade, the 1981 Metropolitano championship after a 1–1 draw v. Racing in the round 17th. The Xeneizes totalized 50 points, with 20 wins, 10 draws and 4 losses. The starting line-up v Racing was: Gatti; Suárez, Mouzo, Ruggeri, Córdoba; Benítez, Passucci, Brindisi; Estudero (Trobbiani), Maradona, Perotti. Maradona and Brindisi were highly regarded as the most notable players of the squad.

The following year, Boca lost the young Maradona, who moved to Europe to play for FC Barcelona, owing also to Argentina's political problems. In 1984 Boca was near to a financial collapse, almost going bankrupt. The same year the team suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of FC Barcelona, losing 1–9 in friendly competition Joan Gamper Trophy. After the departure of Marzolini in 1981, Boca Juniors hired several head coaches although the squad could not win any title until 1989. The list of managers includes Vladislao Cap, Carmelo Faraone, Raúl Rodríguez Seoane, Ernesto Grillo, Miguel Ángel López, Dino Sani, Mario Zanabria, Alfredo Di Stéfano, César Luis Menotti, Roberto Saporiti, Juan Carlos Lorenzo (in his second tenure on the club) and José Omar Pastoriza.

In 1985, Antonio Alegre and Carlos Heller were elected president and vice-president, respectively. Under their command, Boca settled 153 lawsuits early in his tenure by mortgaging his business assets for US$250,000, and by lending Boca Juniors US$800,000. These and other measures enabled them to recover the club's finances. Boca also sold the land acquired earlier for US$21 million.

The club's improved finances led to its revival, and Boca emerged victorious in a number of coveted tournaments in subsequent years, being the 1989 Supercopa Libertadores the last title of the decade, beating Independiente by penalty shoot-out after both legs ended 0–0. The team, managed by Carlos Aimar, achieve its first international honour since the 1978 Copa Libertadores. Ths starting line-up for the second leg was: Navarro Montoya; Stafuza, Simón, Marchesini, Cuciuffo; Giunta, Marangoni, J.D. Ponce, Latorre; Graciani (Pico), Perazzo (S. Berti).

Early 1990s
The number of international titles won increased during the first part of the decade, with Boca Juniors winning the 1990 Recopa Sudamericana, the 1992 Copa Master de Supercopa and the 1993 Copa de Oro (named ""Nicolás Leoz""). At the domestic level, the squad won the celebrated 1992 Apertura, after eleven years without league titles and managed by Uruguayan Óscar Tabárez, who had arrived to the club in 1991. Some of the most notable players of the late 1980s–early 1990s were Carlos Navarro Montoya (ranked 5th among the footballers who played the most matches with the club), Diego Latorre, Gabriel Batistuta, Juan Simón, Carlos Mac Allister, Carlos Tapia, Blas Giunta, Claudio Marangoni, Sergio Martínez, Alberto Márcico, Roberto Cabañas.

In 1995, entrepreneur Mauricio Macri was elected as president of the club. One of his first actions was to refurbish La Bombonera, demolishing the old boxes to build new ones. The club also built a basketball, venue, Estadio Luis Conde (known as La Bombonerita) with a capacity of 2,000 spectators, inaugurated in 1996. Macri also created an investment fund for the purchase of football players. Macri also hired Jorge Griffa to manage the youth divisions of the club with the purpose of promoting new talents from Boca Juniors instead buying players from other clubs.

The first manager under Macri's presidency was former Argentina national team coach, Carlos Bilardo. His tenure lasted only one year, with no titles won despite the large number of players acquired, including Diego Maradona –who had returned to the club– Claudio Caniggia, Juan Verón, Kily González, Fernando Gamboa and Néstor Fabbri. Bilardo resigned after Boca Juniors finished 10th. in the 1996–97 season. Bilardo's successor was Héctor Veira, but he could not win any title with a team that had its best performance in the 1997 Apertura, finishing runner-up.

The Bianchi era: another Golden Age
Former Vélez Sársfield coach Carlos Bianchi arrived at the club in 1998 and under his command, the squad would achieve multiple local and international titles, breaking the record obtained with Juan Carlos Lorenzo in the 1970s. With Carlos Bianchi as coach, Boca won 9 titles.

The first title obtained was the 1998 Apertura, which Boca won being undefeated for the first time. Martín Palermo was the top scorer with 20 goals in 19 matches played. Boca later won a new championship in the 1999 Clausura becoming successive champions. The team remained undefeated in 40 matches, breaking the record of 39 matches achieved by Racing Club in the 1960s. This mark is still a record in the professional era of Argentine football.

The year 2000 was the most successful for Boca Juniors. The team won the Copa Libertadores after 22 years without winning that trophy, defeating Palmeiras in the finals by penalty-shots after two matches ended in a draw (2–2 and 0–0). Goalkeeper Oscar Córdoba was the most notable player of the final played in São Paulo. As the new South America champion, Boca went to Tokyo to play the 2000 Intercontinental Cup against Real Madrid, defeating the Merengue team 2–1 (goals by Palermo). The same year Boca won another local title, the Torneo Apertura, totaling 3 titles in 2000.

In 2001 Boca were Copa Libertadores champion again, defeating Cruz Azul in a penalty shootout. Boca won 1–0 the first final match in Mexico and lost the second game in La Bombonera by the same score. Oscar Córdoba was the most notable player again.

Bianchi left the club in 2002 due to a conflict with the chairman Mauricio Macri, so Oscar Tabárez was chosen as his replacement beginning his second run as team's coach. Nevertheless, Bianchi would return the following year to take care of the team again. In 2003, Boca obtained a new title winning the Copa Libertadores for the 3rd time in 4 years. The most notable player of that tournament was Carlos Tevez while Marcelo Delgado was the top scorer with 9 goals. In the finals played against Santos FC, Boca won 2–0 in Buenos Aires and 3–1 in São Paulo. Boca Juniors completed another successful year winning the 2003 Intercontinental Cup against AC Milan by penalty-shot after a 1–1 draw. Matías Donnet, who tied the game in the 29th minute, was named the Man of the Match.

Boca reached another Copa Libertadores final in 2004, but lost to Once Caldas from Manizales, Colombia in PK's. Once the Cup was over, Bianchi resigned, finishing one of the most successful periods in the club history.

Basile's multi-champion
After Bianchi's departure from the club, Miguel Brindisi (who had played for the club in the 1980s) was chosen as coach but he soon resigned at the end of the 2004 Apertura, when Boca finished 8th. The successor of Brindisi was Jorge Chino Benítez, another player for Boca in the 1970s and 1980s. Under his coaching, Boca won the 2004 Copa Sudamericana defeating Club Bolívar in the finals.

In 2005 (the year of Boca's 100th anniversary) the Xeneize contested another edition of the Copa Libertadores, being eliminated by Chivas de Guadalajara. In that match, Benítez spat at the Chiva's player  Adolfo Bautista, causing a melee which resulted in the referee abandoning the match. Due to this act, Benítez was immediately dismissed by the club. After Benítez's dismissal, Boca hired Alfio Basile as its coach.

With Basile as the coach, Boca won the Recopa Sudamericana (2005 edition), defeating Once Caldas, and the 2005 Copa Sudamericana, where the Xeneize won over Pumas from México by penalty-shots after two draws. Roberto Abbondanzieri was the MVP, stopping two shots and converting the decisive penalty kick. Boca would win two titles more: the 2005 Apertura and 2006 Clausura becoming the successive champion of Argentine football. The squad also obtained the 2006 Recopa Sudamericana over São Paulo.

After the elimination of the Argentina national football team in the 2006 World Cup, Basile was called by the National Association to take over and left the club under a successful run. Under the coaching of Basile, Boca Juniors won five titles within two years (2005–06).

More international success
Ricardo Lavolpe was chosen to be the coach succeeding Basile. In the 2006 Apertura the team made a good campaign but at the end of the season finished with the same number of points as Estudiantes de La Plata, so both teams had to play a match in order to proclaim a new champion. Estudiantes defeated Boca 2–1 in Vélez Sársfield stadium and Lavolpe resigned as the coach.

The next coach was Miguel Ángel Russo and Juan Román Riquelme returned to the club. Boca Juniors won the 2007 Copa Libertadores defeating Brazilian team Gremio in the finals (3–0 in Buenos Aires and 2–0 in Porto Alegre). Riquelme (who scored 8 goals) was considered to be the best player of the tournament by journalists and fans. As the South American champion, Boca went to Tokyo to dispute the FIFA Club World Cup but was defeated by Italian AC Milan by 4–2.

Carlos Ischia was appointed as coach after Russo's departure. Under his coaching, the club won the 2008 Recopa Sudamericana (against Arsenal de Sarandí). On the other hand, Boca was eliminated by Fluminense (which would be the runner up) in the 2008 Copa Libertadores semi-finals. At the end of that year Boca obtained a new title, the 2008 Apertura. That season ended with Boca, San Lorenzo and Tigre in equal 1st position so a play-off tournament had to be contested among those 3 teams in order to proclaim a new champion. Boca won that tournament and became new Argentine champion. That same season Boca's arch-rival River Plate finished the last for the first time in its history.

Boca finished 14th (over 19 teams) in the 2009 Clausura and Ischia was dismissed by the club (although the managers said he had resigned) and Basile was called to start his second run as coach. Nevertheless, after finishing 11th in the 2009 Apertura, Basile left the club.

2010s: local success continues 
For the 2010 Clausura the team was coached firstly by Abel Alves and then by Roberto Pompei, who were working with the youth teams when they were appointed to coach the first division team. Boca finished 16th so the club decided to hire Claudio Borghi (who had won a title coaching Argentinos Juniors the last season) as team's new coach, but he left the club after 14 matches, due to the bad results obtained. Roberto Pompei was designated to be the coach until the end of the Apertura. Boca finished in 12th position.

In January 2011, Boca hired Julio Falcioni who had won a title coaching Banfield in 2009. The team did not have a good campaign in the Clausura, although Boca won the Superclásico (the last played before River was relegated to the second division) finishing 7th. In the last fixture (when Boca played against Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata) Martín Palermo, the all-time top scorer, retired.

For the 2011 Apertura, Boca acquired goalkeeper Agustín Orión and veteran centre back Rolando Schiavi, who returned after his tenure at Newell's Old Boys. After three years without any achievements, Boca won its 30th. league title when the squad defeated Banfield by 3–0 on round 17. The line-up was Orion; Roncaglia, Schiavi, Insaurralde, Clemente Rodríguez; Rivero, Somoza, Erviti; Chávez; Mouche, Cvitanich. Boca Juniors completed the tournament remaining unbeaten, with 12 wins and 7 draws. The team also conceded the fewest goals (only 6 in 19 matches disputed) which set a record for short tournaments in Argentina (after Clausura and Apertura championships were established in 1991). That same season, Boca also won the second edition of the relaunched Copa Argentina, after beating Racing Club at the final. Some changes in the line-up were goalkeeper Ustari, defender Caruzzo and forwards Viatri and Silva.

In 2012, Boca reached the final of Copa Libertadores, five years after having won the 2007 final, but the squad lost to Brazilian Corinthians by 3–1 on aggregate. On the knockout stages, the squad had previously eliminated Unión Española, Fluminense and Universidad de Chile.

In 2013, it was confirmed that Carlos Bianchi, the most successful coach in Boca Juniors' history, would return to take care of the team again. On August 28, 2014, after 74 matches with only 45 percent effectiveness (26 wins and losses), having conceded 88 and scored 79 goals and without any championships, Bianchi was dismissed by the club.

After dismissing Bianchi, former player Rodolfo Arruabarrena was hired as manager of the club. With Arruabarrena as coach, Boca Juniors qualified to the semifinals of 2014 Copa Sudamericana but it was defeated by River Plate (0–1 on aggregate). The next year, Boca Juniors was disqualified from the 2015 Copa Libertadores by CONMEBOL following the incidents that occurred during the match against River Plate at La Bombonera. The sentence came after four River Plate players, Leonardo Ponzio, Leonel Vangioni, Ramiro Funes Mori and Matías Kranevitter suffered a ""chemical kerititis"", an inflammation of the cornea, as a result of the exposure to chemicals during the second leg match against Boca at La Bombonera. Prior to those incidents, Boca Juniors had won all the games at group stage finishing with 18 points and only 2 goals conceded in 6 games played.

After the frustration at Copa Libertadores, Boca would win its 31st league title, the 2015 Primera División on November 1, when the team defeated Tigre in the penultimate fixture of the championship with a goal scored by Fabián Monzón. The line-up for that match was Orión; Peruzzi, Tobio, Rolín, Monzón; Pablo Pérez (Bentancur), Cubas, Meli, Lodeiro (Colazo); Tévez, Calleri (Chávez). Tevez (who had left Juventus to join Boca Juniors at the beginning of that year) was the keyplayer of the team. Only three days after winning the Primera División title, Boca Juniors won the 2014–15 Copa Argentina beating Rosario Central by 2–0 (goals by Lodeiro and Chávez) in a match played at Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes of Córdoba. The match became controversial due to referee Gustavo Ceballos disallowed a Rosario Central goal and awarded Boca Juniors a penalty kick after the foul was committed outside the penalty area. The starting line-up v Rosario Central was: Orión; Peruzzi, Tobio, D. Díaz, Monzón; Meli, Erbes, P. Pérez (Bentancur), Lodeiro (Rolín); Calleri (Chávez), Tévez.

The Barros Schelotto era 
On February 29, 2016, Arruabarrena was dismissed as Boca Juniors manager. Under his coaching, the squad won two titles in 75 games, winning 47, drawing 13 and losing 15. On March 1, Guillermo Barros Schelotto was announced as the new manager, being his third time as manager in a professional football team. He returned to the club after his tenure as player between 1997 and 2007 where he won 16 titles.

Under Barros Schelotto's coaching, Boca reached the semifinals in the 2016 Copa Libertadores after beating Uruguayan Nacional by penalties but the team was eliminated by Ecuadorean Independiente del Valle after losing the two legs (1–2 and 2–3). At domestic level, Boca Juniors won its 32nd league title, the 2016–17 Primera División, where the team crowned champion on June 20, 2017, before playing the 29th round v. Olimpo in Bahía Blanca. The starting line-up was: Rossi; Jara, Tobio (Vergini), Magallán, Silva; Gago, Barrios, Pablo Pérez; Pavón, Benedetto (Bou), Centurión (Benítez). Boca totalised 63 points in 30 matches (7 points over its rival River Plate, runner-up with 56). Besies, Benedetto was the topscorer of the competition with 21 goals.

Boca Juniors won its second consecutive league title in 2017–18, totalising 58 points over 27 matches (Godoy Cruz was the runner-up with 56). Boca crowned champion after a 2–2 tie with Gimnasia y Esgrima LP in round 25 (goals by P. Pérez and Ábila). The starting line-up was: Rossi; Jara, Vergini, Magallán, Mas; Nández, S. Pérez, P. Pérez; Tévez (Benítez); Pavón (Buffarini), Ábila (Cardona).

In November 2018 Boca played a Copa Libertadores final after 6 years. The team had previously eliminated Brazilian clubs Cruzeiro (2–0, 1–1 in quarterfinals) and Palmeiras (2–0, 2–2 in semifinals). In the finals, Boca lost to River Plate (5–3 on aggregate). Because of the incidents by River supporters before the second leg started at Estadio Monumental, the match was suspended and rescheduled for December 9, 2018 at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, where Boca was beaten by its classic rival.

Last years 
In 2019, Gustavo Alfaro was appointed as manager of the team. With him, Boca won the 2018 Supercopa Argentina after beating Rosario Central 6–5 by penalty shoot-out. This would be the only title won with Alfaro so that same season, Boca lost the 2019 Copa de la Superliga to Tigre (0–2). It was also the Matador first title in the top division. Boca Juniors was also eliminated from 2018–19 Copa Argentina after losing to Almagro 3–1 on penalties.

In 2019 Copa Libertadores Boca was eliminated to River Plate by goal difference (1–2 on aggregate). In December 2019, Jorge Amor Ameal was elected as president with media entrepreneur Mario Pergolini and former star Román Riquelme as vice–presidents. Gustavo Alfaro left the club after his contract ended on December 23, being replaced by Miguel Ángel Russo who started his second tenure as manager of the team.

The first title with Russo came in March 2020, after Boca Juniors won the 2019–20 Primera División in the last fixture, when the team beat Gimnasia y Esgrima LP (coached by Diego Maradona) 1–0. With archrival River Plate placed first with 46 points and Boca 2nd with 45, Boca Juniors won the match while River tied 1–1 with Atlético Tucumán therefore Boca won its 34th. league title totalising 48 points. Line-up v Gimnasia was: Andrada; Buffarini, Zambrano (Capaldo), Alonso, Fabra; Salvio (Reynoso), Campuzano, Pol Fernández, Villa; Soldano (Ábila), Tévez.

424,55776530,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redzel,Redzel,"Redzel (foaled 19 September 2012) is an Australian thoroughbred racehorse. He races in the Triple Crown Syndicate silks for a group of owners who bought into the gelding as a yearling. Redzel is known around the stables as Richie after the New Zealand Rugby player, Richie McCaw. Snowden Racing foreman, Lindy Wharekura is originally from New Zealand and came up with the name ""after the greatest ever Captain, of the greatest ever team"". The hashtag #richiefortheeverest trended on social media leading into the inaugural Everest Race largely thanks to the popular following Redzel has amongst the Snowden stable staff. 

Redzel was purchased from the 2014 Magic Millions Gold Coast Yearling sale by Triple Crown Syndicate directors Chris and Michael Ward for $120,000. He is out of the mare, Millrich and by Snitzel. Redzel was Millrich's 10th living foal. She died shortly after Redzel was born and Redzel was fostered onto another mare who would raise the orphan foal. Stud Manager, Kim Alderton remembers Redzel as a foal, ""He was such a burly foal. Some orphans are shy to go for a drink and difficult to foster, but he was just so pushy, and straight in there for some milk. He muscled his way onto his foster mare, Regal Arena, who could be difficult, but he didn’t give her a choice.""

In his first season racing, Redzel was third in the Group 3 Kindergarten Stakes. He continued to show promise but was shy of hitting the board in his following starts. The decision was made to geld him at the end of the 2015 season, which would prove the turning point in his career. 

In 2017 Redzel was the inaugural winner of the world's richest turf race, The Everest, collecting first prize money of  $5,800,000.

In 2018 Redzel led all the way to win the second running of The Everest, collecting first prize money of  $6,000,000.

In the 2020 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Redzel was rated on 118, making him the equal 80th best racehorse in the world.

425,3343752,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachariah%20Allen,Zachariah Allen,"Zachariah Allen (September 15, 1795 – March 17, 1882) was an American textile manufacturer, scientist, lawyer, writer, inventor and civil leader from Providence, Rhode Island. He was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy and at Brown University where he graduated in 1813.

Allen became a textile manufacturer and in 1822 constructed a woolen mill in which he incorporated innovative fire-safety features and his own mechanical improvements. He also built the first hot-air furnace system for the heating of homes.  In 1833 he patented his best-known device, the automatic cut-off valve for steam engines.

He founded the Manufacturers’ Mutual Fire Insurance Company in 1835, the forerunner of the present day insurance company FM Global.

Allen was also a prolific writer of scientific texts and wrote numerous books and articles during his lifetime.

Early life
Zachariah Allen was born on September 15, 1795 in Providence, Rhode Island to Zachariah and Anne (Crawford) Allen. His older brother Philip, served Rhode Island as governor (1851–1853) and later as a United States senator (1853–1859). Allen's father died in 1801, when he was only five years old, so he was mostly raised by his mother, and acquired a love of knowledge, particularly science at an early age. He was educated at a school in Medford, Massachusetts, then later at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire.

Allen's mother Anne died in 1808, just a year before he entered Brown University, where he graduated in 1813. Allen later served as a trustee of the University from 1826 to 1882. Upon graduation from Brown, he briefly considered a career in medicine, but instead studied law for two years in the office of James Burrill, and admitted to practice in the Rhode Island Courts in 1815.

In 1817, Allen married Eliza Harriet Arnold, the daughter of Welcome Arnold, a well-known Providence merchant who had participated in the Gaspee Affair in 1772. The Allens had three daughters, Anne Crawford, Mary Arnold and Candace.

Manufacturer and inventor
In 1821, Allen devised a system to heat several rooms of a house from a single stove or furnace with a system of heat-conducting pipes. With the advent of the use of anthracite coal for heating in the 1820s, Allen's system of heating was soon adapted elsewhere.

In 1822, he organized and constructed a woolen mill in North Providence on the banks of the Woonasquatucket River and constructed a series of dams to provide power to the machinery. The Allendale Mill was one of the earliest textile mills in the nation to incorporate so-called ""slow-burning"" construction, which consisted of a system of cast iron columns supporting large beams covered by heavy wooden planking for the floors and roof and shingles set in mortar, in contrast to the traditional system of lighter joists and thinner flooring.

The mill also contained innovative fire-safety features including first use of heavy fire doors, a sprinkler system, rotary fire pump, and copper-riveted hose to be used on a textile mill in North America.

In 1825, he went to Europe to observe woolen manufactures and later wrote The Practical Tourist about his travels there.

Allen patented an ""extension roller"" for ""raising fobrous naps by teasels"" to produce a smooth, glossy finish to woolen cloth. This system would be used in textile mills for many years.

He invented the first practical automatic cut-off valve for steam engines, which was patented in 1833. Allen's invention was later proclaimed ""one of the greatest inventions ever made in the steam engines"" by Stephen Roper in his 1884 Engineer's Handybook.

In 1852, Allen purchased the 1813 Georgiaville Mill in nearby Smithfield, Rhode Island. He rebuilt the existing mill there and increased the sites water power by raising the dam height of the millpond. He later added steam power and enlarged the mill further. He also built additional dwellings, a church, and a school for the increased work force.

Although Allen went bankrupt in Panic of 1857, he continued to manage the Georgiaville Mills which his brother had bought.

Mutual insurance
About 1834, after he had taken numerous measures to protect his mill from fire, Allen appealed to his insurance company to lower his premiums. The insurance company claimed to ""know nothing about his mill, or apparatus"" and refused to adjust the premium. Allen studied the problem and in 1835 joined with several other mill owners to establish the Providence Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company, introducing a system of basing premiums on the effectiveness of safety equipment based on the nature of the business, adequacy of the apparatus and the safe methods of factory construction.

In 1848, Allen formed another mutual insurance company, Rhode Island Mutual Fire Insurance Company to supplement Manufacturers' Mutual.

Two years later, the Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company was founded by James Read and others, after consultation with Allen. The system of factory mutual insurance would be duplicated in dozens of other locations by the end of the 19th century.

The modern descendant of Zachariah Allen's Mutual Fire Insurance Company, now known as FM Global maintains its headquarters in Johnston, Rhode Island, not far from the Allendale Mill.

Community leader
As a member of the town council of Providence from the early 1820s, was influential in introducing the first fire engine in the city. Later he was active and in the planning and construction of city's first water works which opened in 1871.

Allen was one of the founders of the Providence Athenaeum in 1831. He was among the founders of the Rhode Island Historical Society, serving as its president in his later years. He was also a member of the Franklin Society for Promoting the Study of Science as well as the Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry.

In support of the working man, Allen was instrumental in the founding of the first free evening school in New England in 1840, and in the establishment of the Providence Association of Manufacturers and Mechanics. In 1845, he became one of the original trustees of Butler Hospital.

He was also active in the establishment of Roger Williams Park, in Providence. He was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and attended St. John's Church for many years.

Zachariah Allen died on May 17, 1882 at his home on Magee Street in Providence. He is buried at North Burial Ground in Providence, where he served as a commissioner for thirty-two years. Mrs. Allen had died in 1873. The house on Magee Street which Allen had built in 1864 was acquired by Brown University in 1938, and is now occupied by the Brown Faculty Club.

He was confirmed by the National Assembly on 27 June 2006, having been nominated by his predecessor, Phan Văn Khải, who retired from office. At a party congress held in January 2011, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was ranked 3rd in the hierarchy of the Communist Party of Vietnam, after State President Trương Tấn Sang. Following the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng wasn't able to maintain his post in the party and stepped down from his position as Prime Minister on 7 April 2016.

Early life
Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was born on 17 November 1949 in Cà Mau in southern Vietnam. He purportedly volunteered on his 12th birthday to join the Vietcong, doing first-aid, and communication tasks; he also worked as a nurse, and a physician. He was wounded four times during the Vietnam War, and was later ranked as a level 2/4 wounded veteran. As a Senior Lieutenant he was Chief Political Commissar of Infantry Battalion 207; as a Captain, he was Political Chief of Infantry Regiment 152, defending the southwestern border. As Major, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng headed the Personnel Board of Kien Giang Province's Military Command.

He attended the high-level Nguyen Ai Quoc Party School. He was admitted to the Communist Party of Vietnam on 10 June 1967.

Military career
Nguyễn Tấn Dũng reportedly joined the People's Army of Vietnam in 1961, serving until 1984. He fought in the south and in the west during the Vietnam War. He cited his desire for ""national independence"" as his reasons for fighting on the battlefield. During this time, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng served in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, which resulted in the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. During his service, he was wounded four times.

Police career 
Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was appointed Deputy Minister of Public Security with the rank of Police Major General in January 1995, serving until 1996.

Political career
Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was admitted to the Communist Party of Vietnam on 10 June 1967. He was a protégé of conservative Lê Đức Anh and reformist Võ Văn Kiệt, leaders from both major factions in the party, which enabled him to become the youngest member of the Politburo in 1996. Nguyễn Tấn Dũng previously served as permanent deputy prime minister (first deputy prime minister) from 1997–2006. He was also the governor of the State Bank of Vietnam between 1998 and 1999.

From October 1981 onwards, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was a member of the Communist Party of Vietnam and was active in political affairs and activities of the Communist Party of Vietnam in the following positions: Kiên Giang Provincial Party Committee, Deputy Chief of Staff Committee Provincial Party Committee; Member of Standing Committee of Kiên Giang Party Committee, Secretary of Hà Tiên District Party Committee; Standing Deputy Secretary and Secretary of Provincial Party Committee; Chairman of the People's Committees; Party Secretary of Kiên Giang Province Military Party Committee; Member of Party Committee of Military Region 9; Representative of the People's Council of Kiên Giang Province

Prime Minister (2006-2016)

First term
Nguyễn Tấn Dũng is the first senior Vietnamese communist leader born after the August Revolution in 1945 and the youngest Vietnamese prime minister (57 years old when he assumed the office). He is also a native southerner and remained in the southern region throughout the Vietnam War (he was onrom government control of the media to personal career tips. One youth asked how he could be Prime Minister someday, to which Nguyễn Tấn Dũng replied: ""Throughout my time following the Party and the Revolution, I always obeyed the assignments of the organization.""

It was reported that Vietnam's post-war generation ""is increasingly wired, as the Communist Party attempts to foster economic growth and high-tech skills"". The government blocks politically oriented sites. There has also been talk of censoring blogs; it was noted that there is a fake Nguyễn Tấn Dũng blog on which the language ""mimics official jargon, but is subtly peppered with anti-communist barbs"".

Second term
On 26 July 2011, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was officially re-elected prime minister by the 13th National Assembly, winning 470 out of 500 votes. He lost out to Trương Tấn Sang in the competition to lead the party's Politburo, or executive committee.

In October 2011, it was reported that political dissidents in Vietnam were ""facing a growing crackdown on their activities ... [s]ince the Communist party congress in January, the authorities have steadily ratcheted up the pressure on dissidents"". Since 30 July, 15 religious activists had been imprisoned. One lawyer with deep family connections to the Communist party was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment ""to the shock and outrage of large sections of the Vietnamese public"". A Human Rights Watch report also detailed forced labour and torture throughout the country's drug rehabilitation centres. Australian Vietnam expert Carlyle Thayer said ""Nguyễn Tấn Dũng ... is decidedly not a reformer."" Although the U.S. and India are developing closer ties to Vietnam, neither ""has seen fit to pressure Vietnam on its rights record with any conviction or consistency"".

In August 2012, the arrest of Nguyễn Đức Kiên, a local tycoon thought to be close to Nguyễn Tấn Dũng, sparked discussions about Nguyễn Tấn Dũng's ongoing political battle with President Trương Tấn Sang. Following these discussions, much of the anger about nepotism and poor economic management has been directed at Nguyễn Tấn Dũng.

At Central Committee meeting in October 2012, general secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the head of the Communist Party announced Politburo agreed to propose the committee impose a form of discipline on it and consider discipline on a Politburo member (thought to beNguyễn Tấn Dũng), but the Central Committee decided to not take any discipline on the Politburo and one of its members – from the prime minister's mistakes in economic management issues, anti-corruption ... Dũng has been 'near-alleged' of ""large-scale corruption"" surrounding himself and his family. Earlier the Central Committee decided to take the Central Steering Committee for Anti-Corruption away from Nguyễn Tấn Dũng's control, and the committee is now controlled by the Politburo and the general secretary is chief of committee.

On 14 November 2012 Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was told by a National Assembly member, Dương Trung Quốc, to resign for his mistakes in handling the economy. He said that it was time for the prime minister to take responsibility, not just apologise. The attack was unusual because it was made in front of TV cameras in parliament.

Foreign relations
In 2009, Dũng made a two-day visit to Russia, where he signed a multibillion-dollar arms deal. In 2010, one deputy called for a no confidence motion against Dũng in response to a major management and financial scandal at the state owned Vinashin shipbuilding group. At a party congress in January 2011, he was nominated for another term as prime minister.

On 12 April 2010, Dũng attended a luncheon with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and other world leaders at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. On the same date he met Obama at the World Security Summit where he ""spoke glowingly to American business leaders of Vietnam's economic growth – 7.2% per year over the last decade – and endorsed Obama's concerns about nuclear safety"".

In April 2012, Dũng met with Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Okada Katsuya. He expressed his approval with the growing level of cooperation between Vietnam and Japan and they discussed moving forward. They talked about ways accelerate visitation and simplifying both entry procedures and exchange programs. Dũng stated that Vietnam wants to cooperate further and learn from Japan's experience in social insurance and continue to increase Japanese official development assistance.

One of his most remarkable moments was his visit to the Vatican to meet with the Pope, the first time any Vietnamese leader had done so since at least 1975 when Vietnam severed diplomatic ties with the Vatican following the Nation's reunification at the end of the Vietnam War.

Personal life
Nguyễn Tấn Dũng is married to Trần Thanh Kiệm and has three children:
 Nguyễn Thanh Nghị (born 1976) is a George Washington University alumnus. Nghị is currently the Minister of Construction.
 Nguyễn Thanh Phượng (born 1981) is Chairwoman of Ban Viet Investment Fund. Phượng is married to Nguyễn Bảo Hoàng, who held American citizenship. Hoàng is the head of IDG Ventures, a leading tech, retail and media angel fund in Vietnam. He is also the Chairman of the Vietnam Basketball Association, the owner of Saigon Heat and of McDonald's franchises in Vietnam.
Nguyễn Minh Triết is an officer of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union. He previously studied aeronautical engineering at Queen Mary University of London.

Their sound has been described as melodic death metal, symphonic metal, and progressive metal. The band changed its name to InHuman in 2020 and released their most recent album in 2021.

History
The band formed in 2007 under name Anwynn, after the Annwn location in Welsh mythology. No members of the band have been present through its entire history, and the last original member, bassist Vincent ""Wobi"" Van Loo, departed in 2020. Since their inception they have featured two singers, with a female singer to deliver operatic vocals as a counterpoint to the death metal vocals of a male singer. As Anwynn they released two early demos, and until 2012 the band experienced frequent lineup changes. They released the full-length album Forbidden Songs in 2012, which earned some positive reviews in the European rock press, and was supported by a high-profile appearance at the Metal Female Voices Festival. This was followed by the EP Swords & Blood in 2015.

In 2020, Van Loo and two other longtime members left the band and four new members joined, resulting in a septet with singers Dietwin Elbers and Eline Van De Putte, guitarists Eerik Maurage and Romain Caudron, bassist Julien ""Jukka"" Huyssens, keyboardist Astrid Kaiserman, and drummer Yūki Koichi Takano. The band changed its name to InHuman, and released a self-titled album under that name in February 2021.

It is part of Space Delta 6 and is located at New Boston Space Force Station, New Hampshire. Prior to July 2020, part of the 50th Network Operations Group, itself a part of the 50th Space Wing.

History

23rd Airways Detachment (1942–1943) 
The 23rd Space Operations Squadron was originally activated on 25 July 1942 as the 23rd Airways Detachment. The squadron served in India and China during World War II, earning campaign streamers for India-Burma (1942–1945) and the China Defensive (1942–1945) before disbanding on 1 December 1943.

Air Force Space Command (1991–2019) 
On 1 November 1991, the Air Force reconstituted the 23rd Airways Detachment and designated it the 23rd Space Operations Squadron (23rd SOPS). Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) activated the unit at New Boston Air Force Station in New Hampshire. 

The squadron assumed responsibility for the operation of the New Hampshire Tracking Station, replacing a detachment of the 2nd Satellite Tracking Group. Satellite support operations there had begun on 1 April 1960, using van-mounted equipment. Simultaneous with van operations, the installation of equipment in permanent facilities began under the Weapons Systems 117L program. Van operations were gradually phased out, and by June 1964 the entire station was operating in permanent facilities. By the summer of 1964, the station had dual satellite tracking, telemetry and commanding capabilities. On 1 October 1987 the operations were transferred to AFSPC, and the station moved from a research and development environment into the operational Air Force.

On 10 March 2004, the squadron was realigned under the 50th Network Operations Group, part of the 50th Space Wing. It began supporting three other SCN sites in October 2010, including Detachment 1 located at Thule Air Base in Greenland, and RAF Oakhanger in the United Kingdom. The third site, the Eastern Vehicle Checkout Facility (EVCF), is located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida (callsign BEACH) and ensures SCN capabilities and operation of satellites prior to and during initial launch. The squadron began supporting two Global Positioning System (GPS) ground antennas and monitor stations on 1 August 2011. One is located at Cape Canaveral and the other is located at Ascension Auxiliary Air Field on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean.

The squadron completed installation of an Automated Remote Tracking Station capability at the Eastern Vehicle Checkout Facility based at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 29 August 2013. The EVCF is responsible for launch-based compatibility testing and launch data collection, primarily on the Eastern Launch Range.

US Space Force (2019–present) 
The squadron was realigned to Space Delta 6 of the United States Space Force on 24 July 2020.

Mission
The 23rd Space Operations Squadron (23rd SOPS) provides US Space Command with critical satellite command and control capability to more than 190 Department of Defense, national and civilian satellites performing intelligence, weather, navigation, early-warning and communications operations.

Locations 
The squadron provides assured access to space and cyberspace by operating and maintaining the Satellite Control Network's largest remote tracking station at New Boston Space Force Station in New Hampshire, as well as at three other Geographically Separate Units located at Thule Air Base in Greenland, Oakhanger in the United Kingdom, and the Eastern Vehicle Checkout Facility (EVCF) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

Operations

The squadron provides real-time capability to users performing on-orbit tracking, telemetry, commanding, and mission data retrieval services. Additionally, the squadron provides remote command and control capability through two Global Positioning System (GPS) control stations located at Cape Canaveral and Ascension Auxiliary Air Field in the South Atlantic Ocean.

The squadron also operates and maintains a ground station of the Defense Satellite Communications System and additional equipment in support of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other mission partners.

The 23rd SOPS operates and maintains New Boston SFS, an installation of  which includes infrastructure worth more than $106 million. The squadron performs all station operations for the installation including security, civil engineering, communications, services, natural resources and safety.

432,844077,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enos%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%20prophet%29,Enos (Book of Mormon prophet),"Enos (; ) is a figure in the Book of Mormon who is a son or grandson of Jacob, a Nephite prophet and author of the Book of Enos. According to the Book of Mormon, Enos lived sometime in the 6th century BC.

Family

Or, alternately:

Nephite record keeping

According to the Book of Mormon narrative, Enos was third in the series of record keepers who maintained the record of the Nephites, a set of metal plates containing the spiritual and secular history of the Nephites. Enos was given charge of the record by his father, Jacob, son of Lehi and brother of Nephi. Both Nephi and Jacob had kept the record previously, recording First and Second Nephi and the Book of Jacob, respectively. Enos's contribution to the record, the Book of Enos, consists of a single chapter, told in the first person, describing his own conversion and subsequent ministry.

Following Enos's death the record of the Nephites was kept by Enos' son, Jarom.

Early life

No details of Enos's early life are given except that he had been taught by his father ""in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord"". Because Enos begins his story by telling of his ""wrestle which [he] had before God, before [he] received a remission of [his] sins"", it is sometimes assumed that he had been rebellious prior to that time. President Spencer W. Kimball said, ""Like many sons of good families he strayed. How heinous were his sins I do not know, but they must have been grievous"".

Conversion

Enos relates that, while hunting beasts in the forest, his ""soul hungered"" and he knelt and prayed for forgiveness. His prayer continued throughout the day and into the night, until he heard a voice, saying: ""Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed"".

Having obtained personal forgiveness, Enos continued to pray on behalf of his people, the Nephites, and was given to understand that they would be blessed ""according to their diligence in keeping [God's] commandments"". His faith being strengthened by these revelations, he began to pray for ""[his] brethren, the Lamanites"", who had become estranged from the Nephites and were now their enemies. He received a promise that the record of the Nephites would be preserved and would be brought forth to the Lamanites in the Lord's ""due time"".

Ministry

Following this powerful conversion, Enos went forth prophesying to the Nephites. He testifies that the Nephites tried to ""restore the Lamanites to the true faith in God"", but that they were unsuccessful. He describes the Lamanites as having become ""wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people"". The Nephites, in contrast, are industrious at farming and herding, but Enos makes it clear that they were ""stiffnecked"" and continual preaching of the word of God was necessary to keep them from ""going down speedily to destruction"".

At the close of his record, Enos testifies of his unshakeable faith in his Redeemer.

Possible origin of the name 
The name ""Enos"" or ""Enosh"" (Hebrew: אֱנוֹשׁ) appears in at least two books of the Bible. It means ""mortal man"", in Hebrew, which Hugh Nibley remarks as being similar in definition to the name ""Adam"".

In the Book of Genesis, Enos is the first son of Seth who figures in the Generations of Adam, and consequently referred to within the genealogies of Chronicles, and the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke.

In 1993 it had a competitive admissions process as there was not enough space for every high school student in Kiribati; the remainder had to enroll in Christian high schools. Since then the Kiribati government had established two additional government high schools.

The school is next to the Ministry of Education head office.

History
It was formed by the 1965 merger of two schools: King George V School, a boys' secondary school that was founded in 1922 in Bairiki and later moved to Abemama, and then Bikenibeu in 1953, and the Elaine Bernacchi School, a girls' secondary school founded in 1959 in Bikenibeu. From 1953 until 1975 students from the Ellice Islands could sit the selection tests for admission to the King George V School and the Elaine Bernacchi Secondary School. In 1974, the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu, which ended the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. The following year the Tuvaluan students were transferred to Motufoua Secondary School.

Previously teachers at KGV/EBS did curriculum development for all government schools in Kiribati, but in 1988 they began asking for compensation for their curriculum development. The Curriculum Development and Resources Centre
(CDRC), formed in 1992, eventually assumed responsibility for that task.

438,42693900,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham%20Neyman,Abraham Neyman,"Abraham Neyman (born June 14, 1949, Israel) is an Israeli mathematician and game theorist,  Professor of Mathematics at the Federmann Center for the Study of Rationality and the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He served as president of the Israeli Chapter of the  Game Theory Society (2014–2018).

Biography 
Neyman received his BSc in mathematics in 1970 and his MSc in mathematics in 1972 from the Hebrew University. His MSc thesis was on the subject of “The Range of a Vector Measure” and was supervised by Joram Lindenstrauss. His PhD thesis, ""Values of Games with a Continuum of Players,"" was completed under Robert Aumann in 1977.

Neyman has been professor of mathematics at the Hebrew University since 1982, including serving as the chairman of the institute of mathematics 1992–1994, as well as holding a professorship in economics, 1982–1990. He has been a member of the Center for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University since its inception in 1991. He held various positions at Stony Brook University of New York, 1985–2001. He has also held positions and has been visiting scholar at Cornell University, University of California at
Berkeley, Stanford University, the Graduate School of Business Administration at Harvard University, and Ohio State University.

Neyman has had 12 graduate students complete Ph.D. theses under his supervision, five at Stony Brook University and seven at the Hebrew University. Neyman has also served as the Game Theory Area Editor for the journal Mathematics of Operations Research (1987–1993) and on the editorial board for Games and Economic Behavior (1993–2001) and the International Journal of Game Theory (2001–2007).

Awards and honors 

Neyman has been a fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989.

The Game Theory Society released, in March 2016, a special issue of the International Journal of Game Theory in honour of Neyman, ""in recognition of his important contributions to game theory"". A Festschrift conference in Neyman's honour was held at Hebrew University in June 2015, on the occasion of Neyman's 66th birthday. He gave the inaugural von-Neumann lecture at the 2008 Congress of the  Game Theory Society  as well as delivering it at the 2012 World Congress on behalf of the recently deceased Jean-Francois Mertens.

His Ph.D. thesis won two prizes from the Hebrew University: the 1977 Abraham Urbach prize for distinguished thesis in mathematics and the 1979 Aharon Katzir prize (for the best Ph. D. thesis in the Faculties of Exact Science, Mathematics, Agriculture and Medicine). In addition, Neyman won the Israeli under 20 chess championship in 1966.

Research contributions 

Neyman has made numerous contributions to game theory, including to stochastic games, the Shapley value, and repeated games.

Stochastic games 

Together with Jean-Francois Mertens, he proved the existence of the uniform value of zero-sum undiscounted stochastic games. This work is considered one of the most important works in the theory of stochastic games, solving a problem that had been open for over 20 years.  Together with Elon Kohlberg, he applied operator techniques to study convergence properties of the discounted and finite stage values. Recently, he has pioneered a model of stochastic games in continuous time and derived uniform equilibrium existence results. He also co-edited, together with Sylvain Sorin, a comprehensive
collection of works in the field of stochastic games.

Repeated games 

Neyman has made many contributions to the theory of repeated games.  One idea that appears, in different contexts, in some of his papers, is that the model of an infinitely repeated game serves also as a powerful paradigm for a long finitely repeated game.  A related insight appears in a 1999 paper, where he showed that in a long finitely repeated game, an exponentially small deviation from common knowledge of the number of repetitions is enough to dramatically alter the equilibrium analysis, producing a folk-theorem-like result.

Neyman is one of the pioneers and a most notable leader of the study of repeated games under complexity constraints. In his seminal paper he showed that bounded memory can justify cooperation in a finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma game. His paper was followed by many others who started working on bounded memory games. Most notable was Neyman's M.Sc. student Elchanan Ben-Porath who was the first to shed light on the strategic value of bounded complexity.

The two main models of bounded complexity, automaton size and recall capacity, continued to pose intriguing open problems in the following decades. A major breakthrough was achieved when Neyman and his Ph.D. student Daijiro Okada proposed a new approach to these problems, based on information theoretic techniques, introducing the notion of strategic entropy. His students continued to employ Neyman's entropy technique to achieve a better understanding of repeated games under complexity constraints. Neyman's information theoretic approach opened new research areas beyond bounded complexity. A classic example is the communication game he introduced jointly with Olivier Gossner and Penelope Hernandez.

The Shapley value 

Neyman has made numerous fundamental contributions to the theory of the value.  In a ""remarkable tour-de-force of combinatorial
reasoning"", he proved the existence of an asymptotic value for weighted majority games.  The proof was facilitated by his fundamental contribution to renewal theory. In subsequent work Neyman proved that many of the assumptions made in these works can be relaxed, while showing that others are essential.

Neyman proved the diagonality of continuous values, which had many implications on further developments of the theory. Together with Pradeep Dubey and Robert James Weber he studied the theory of semivalues, and separately demonstrated its importance in political economy.  Together with Pradeep Dubey  he characterized the well-known phenomenon of value correspondence, a fundamental notion in economics, originating already in Edgeworth's work and Adam Smith before him. In loose terms, it essentially states that in a large economy consisting of many economically insignificant agents, the core of the economy coincides with the perfectly competitive outcomes, which in the case of differentiable preferences is a unique element that is the Aumann–Shapley value. Another major contribution of Neyman was the introduction of the Neyman value, a far-reaching generalization of the Aumann–Shapley value to the case of non-differentiable vector measure games.

Other 

Neyman has made contributions to other fields of mathematics, usually motivated by problems in game theory. Among these contributions are a renewal theorem for sampling without replacement (mentioned above as applied to the theory of the value), contributions to embeddings of Lp spaces, contributions to the theory of vector measures, and to the theory of non-expansive mappings.

Business involvements 

Neyman previously served (2005–8) as director at Tradus (previously named QXL). He also held a directorship (2004–5) at Gilat Satellite Networks. In 1999, Neyman
co-founded Bidorbuy, the first online auction company to operate in India and in South Africa, and serves as the chairman of the board. Since 2013, he has held a directorship at the Israeli bank Mizrahi-Tefahot.

Originally published in 1992, it was reissued in 2014 in ebook and audiobook formats with a new introduction by Jonathan Alter. The book covers the lives of the Gordons, an American family with many familiar experiences and struggles, including a move from the city to the suburbs, and four rebellious children. One of the grown children, Susan Gordon Lydon, wrote her own memoir in parallel, published the next year: Take The Long Way Home: Memoirs Of A Survivor.

Summary 
Home Fires tells the story of the Gordon family – real people, names unchanged - over nearly five decades, from the end of World War II to the early 1990s.  The book chronicles the turbulent postwar era, illuminating the interplay between private life and profound cultural changes. Juxtaposing day-to-day family life with landmark public events, Home Fires is a revealing portrait of the second half of the 20th century in America

Members of the family profiled include composer Ricky Ian Gordon.

Reception 
Home Fires received widespread critical acclaim.  Publishers Weekly described it as a ""moving, perceptive social history"" and ""riveting reading."" The New York Times called it ""mesmerizing, important"" and Glamour called it ""a flat-out marvel of reportage."" Author Jonathan Alter, who also wrote the introduction for the 2014 edition, wrote ""Katz’s familial lens on recent history belongs on a shelf with classics. There is Balzac here, and Theodore Dreiser, with a touch of John Gunther, John Dos Passos and William Manchester.""

Awards and honors 
Home Fires was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.

443,284528,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard,Bitboard,"A bitboard is a specialized bit array data structure commonly used in computer systems that play board games, where each bit corresponds to a game board space or piece. This allows parallel bitwise operations to set or query the game state, or determine moves or plays in the game.

Bits in the same bitboard relate to each other by the rules of the game, often forming a game position when taken together.  Other bitboards are commonly used as masks to transform or answer queries about positions.  Bitboards are applicable to any game whose progress is represented by the state of, or presence of pieces on, discrete spaces of a gameboard, by mapping of the space states to bits in the data structure.  Bitboards are a more efficient alternative board representation to the traditional mailbox representation, where each piece or space on the board is an array element.

Bitboards are especially effective when the associated bits of various related states on the board fit into a single word or double word of the CPU architecture, so that single bitwise operators like AND and OR can be used to build or query game states.

Among the computer game implementations that use bitboards are chess, checkers, othello and word games. The scheme was first employed in checkers programs in the 1950s, and since the mid-1970s has been the de facto standard for game board representation in computer automatons.

Description

A bitboard, a specialized bit field, is a format that packs multiple related boolean variables into the same machine word, typically representing a position on a board game, or state of a game.  Each bit represents a space; when the bit is positive, a property of that space is true.  Bitboards allow the computer to answer some questions about game state with one bitwise operation.  For example, if a chess program wants to know if the white player has any pawns in the center of the board (center four squares) it can just compare a bitboard for the player's pawns with one for the center of the board using a bitwise AND operation.  If there are no center pawns then the result will be all zero bits (i.e. equal to zero).  Multiple bitboards may represent different properties of spaces over the board, and special or temporary bitboards (like temporary variables) may represent local properties or hold intermediate collated results.

The efficacy of bitboards is augmented by two other properties of the implementation. First, bitboards are fast to incrementally update, such as flipping the bits at the source and destination positions in a  bitboard for piece location when a piece is moved.  Second, bitmaps representing static properties like all spaces attacked by each piece type for every position on a chessboard can be pre-collated and stored in a table, so that answering a question like ""what are the legal moves of a knight on space e4?"" can be answered by a single memory fetch.

Bitfield implementations take advantage of the presence of fullword (32-bit or 64-bit) bitwise logical operations like AND, OR, NOT and others on modern CPU architectures in order to be efficient. Bitboards may not be effective on earlier 8- and 16-bit minicomputer and microprocessor architectures.

Implementation issues
As a result of necessary compression and encoding of the contents of massive tables and the probability of transcription or encoding errors, bitboard programs are tedious for software developers to either write or debug.  Auxiliary generative methods not part of the application are usually required to build the tables.

Processor use

Pros
Bitboard representations use parallel bitwise operations available on nearly all CPUs that complete in one cycle and are fully pipelined and cached etc.  Nearly all CPUs have AND, OR, NOR, and XOR.  
Furthermore, modern CPUs have instruction pipelines that queue instructions for execution.  A processor with multiple execution units can perform more than one instruction per cycle if more than one instruction is available in the pipeline.  Normal instruction sequences with branches may cause the pipeline to empty if a branch is mispredicted. Many bitboard operations require fewer conditionals and therefore increase pipelining and make effective use of multiple execution units on many CPUs.

CPUs have a bit width which they are designed toward and can carry out bitwise operations in one cycle in this width.  So, on a 64-bit or more CPU, 64-bit operations can occur in one instruction.  There may be support for higher or lower width instructions.  Many 32-bit CPUs may have some 64-bit instructions and those may take more than one cycle or otherwise be handicapped compared to their 32-bit instructions.

If the bitboard is larger than the width of the instruction set, multiple instructions will be required to perform a full-width operation on it.  So a program using 64-bit bitboards would run faster on a 64-bit processor than on a 32-bit processor.

Cons
Bitboard representations have much longer code, both source and object code.  Long bit-twiddling sequences are technically tricky to write and debug.  The bitboards themselves are sparse, sometimes containing only a single one bit in 64, so bitboard implementations are memory-intensive.  Both these issues may increase cache misses or cause cache thrashing.

If the processor does not have hardware instructions for 'first one' (or 'count leading zeros') and 'count ones' (or 'count zeros'), the implementation will be significantly handicapped, as these operations are extremely inefficient to code as assembly language loops.

Cache and memory use

Pros
Bitboards require more memory than piece-list board data structures, but are more execution efficient because many loop-and-compare operations are reduced to a single (or small number of) bitwise operation(s). For example, in mailbox, determining whether piece attacks space requires generating and looping through legal moves of piece and comparing the final space with space.  With bitboards, the legal moves of piece are stored in a bitmap, and that map is ANDed with the bitmap for space.  A non-zero result means that piece attacks space.

Cons
For some games, writing a bitboard engine requires a fair amount of source code including data tables that will be longer than the compact mailbox/enumeration implementation. For mobile devices (such as cell phones) with a limited number of registers or processor instruction cache, this can cause a problem. For full-sized computers, it may cause cache misses between level-one and level-two cache. This is only a potential problem, not a major drawback, as most machines will have enough instruction cache for this not to be an issue.

Incremental update
Some kinds of bitboards are derived from others by an elaborate process of cross-correlation, such as the attack maps in chess.  Reforming all these maps at each change of game state (such as a move) can be prohibitively expensive, so derived bitmaps are incrementally updated, a process which requires intricate and precise code. This is much faster to execute, because only bitmaps associated with changed spaces, not all bitmaps over the board, need to change.  Without incremental update, bitmapped representation may not be more efficient than the older mailbox representation where update is intrinsically local and incremental.

Precomputed bitmaps and table lookup
Some kinds of bitmaps that don't depend on board configurations can be precomputed and retrieved by table lookup rather than collated after a move or state change of the board, such as spaces attacked by a knight or king located on each of 64 spaces of a chessboard that would otherwise require an enumeration.

Chess bitboards 
The obvious, and simplest representation of the configuration of pieces on a chessboard, is as a list (array) of pieces in a conveniently searchable order (such as smallest to largest in value) that maps each piece to its location on the board.  Analogously, collating the spaces attacked by each piece requires a serial enumeration of such spaces for a piece.  This scheme is called mailbox addressing. Separate lists are maintained for white and black pieces, and often for white and black pawns.  The maps are updated each move, which requires a linear search (or two if a piece was captured) through the piece list.  The advantage of mailbox is simple code; the disadvantage is linear lookups are slow.  Faster, but more elaborate data structures that map pieces to locations are called bitboards.

Standard

In bitboard representations, each bit of a 64 bit word (or double word on 32-bit architectures) is associated with a square of the chessboard.  Any mapping of bits to squares can be used, but by broad convention, bits are associated with squares from left to right and bottom to top, so that bit 0 represents square a1, bit 7 is square h1, bit 56 is square a8 and bit 63 is square h8.

Many different configurations of the board are usually represented by their own bitboards including the locations of the kings, all white pawns, all black pawns, as well as bitboards for each of the other piece types or combinations of pieces like all white pieces.  Two attack bitboards are also universal: one bitboard per square for all pieces attacking the square, and the inverse bitboard for all squares attacked by a piece for each square containing a piece.  Bitboards can also be constants like one representing the first rank, which would have one bits in positions 0 - 7.  Other local or transitional bitboards like ""all spaces adjacent to the king attacked by opposing pieces"" may be collated as necessary or convenient.

An example of the use of the bitboards would be determining whether a piece is  en prise: bitboards for ""all friendly pieces guarding space"" and ""all opposing pieces attacking space"" would allow matching the pieces to readily determine whether a target piece on space is en prise.

One of the drawbacks of standard bitboards is collating the attack vectors of the sliding pieces (rook, bishop, queen), because they have an indefinite number of attack spaces depending on other occupied spaces. This requires several lengthy sequences of masks, shifts and complements per piece.

Auxiliary bitboard representations 
In acknowledgement of the code size and computing complexity of generating bitboards for the attack vectors of sliding pieces, alternate bitboard data structures have been devised to collate them.  The bitboard representations of knights, kings, pawns and other board configurations is unaffected by the use of auxiliary bitboards for the sliding pieces.

Rotated  bitboards
Rotated bitboards are complementary bitboard data structures that enable tabularizing of sliding piece attack vectors, one for file attack vectors of rooks, and one each for the diagonal and anti-diagonal attack vectors of bishops (rank attacks of rooks can be indexed from standard bitboards).  With these bitboards, a single table lookup replaces lengthy sequences of bitwise operations.

These bitboards rotate the board occupancy configuration by 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and/or 315 degrees. A standard bitboard will have one byte per rank of the chess board. With this bitboard it's easy to determine rook attacks across a rank, using a table indexed by the occupied square and the occupied positions in the rank (because rook attacks stop at the first occupied square). By rotating the bitboard 90 degrees, rook attacks up and down a file can be examined the same way. Adding bitboards rotated 45 degrees and 315 degrees (-45 degrees) produces bitboards in which the diagonals are easy to examine. The queen can be examined by combining rook and bishop attacks.  Actually rotating a bitboard is an inelegant transformation that can take dozens of instructions.

Direct hashing
The rank and file attack vectors of rooks and the diagonal and anti-diagonal attack vectors of bishops can be separately masked and used as indices into a hash table of precomputed attack vectors depending on occupancy, 8-bits each for rooks and 2-8 bits each for bishops.  The full attack vector of a piece is obtained as the union of each of the two unidirectional vectors indexed from the hash table.  The number of entries in the hash table is modest, on the order of 8*2^8 or 2K bytes, but two hash function computations and two lookups per piece are required., see the hashing scheme employed.

Magic bitboards
Magic bitboards are an extrapolation of the time-space tradeoff of direct hashing lookup of attack vectors. These use a transmutation of the full attack vector as an index into the hash table.  Magic is a misnomer, and simply refers to the generation and use of a perfect hash function in conjunction with tricks to reduce the potential size of the hash table that would have to be stored in memory, which is 8*2^64 or 144 exabytes.  The first observation is that the outer squares or first and eighth ranks together with the 'a' and 'h' files are irrelevant to the occupancy of the attack vector: the piece attacks those squares or not (depending on other blocking pieces) regardless of occupancy, so these can be eliminated from consideration, leaving just 6x6 or 36 squares (~bits in the corresponding hash function). As with other schemes which require a perfect hashing function, an exhaustive process of enumeration, partly algorithmic and partly trial and error, is necessary to generate the hash function.  But the intractable issue remains: these are very active tables, and their size (less than a million entries in most cases) is huge relative to the lower level cache sizes of modern chip architectures, resulting in cache flooding.  So magic bitboards in many applications provide no performance gain over more modest hashing schemes or rotated bitboards.

History
The bitboard method for representing a board game appears to have been invented in the mid-1950s, by Arthur Samuel and was used in his checkers program.
For the more complicated game of chess, it appears the method was independently rediscovered later by the Kaissa team in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s, and again by the authors of the U.S. Northwestern University program ""Chess"" in the early 1970s.  The 64-bit word length of 1970s super computers like Amdahl and Cray machines, facilitated the development of bitboard representations which conveniently mapped the 64-squares of the chessboard to bits of a word.

Rotated bitboards for collating the moves of sliding pieces were invented by Professor Robert Hyatt, author of Cray Blitz and Crafty chess engines, sometime in the mid-1990s and shared with the Dark Thought programming team. They were later implemented in Crafty and Dark Thought, but the first published description wasn't until 1997.

A decade later, direct lookup methods using masked ranks, files and diagonals to index a table of attack vectors depending on occupancy states of bits under the mask, were introduced.  One such scheme utilizing a perfect hash function to eliminate hash collisions, was termed ""magic bitboards"".  Nonetheless, the large size and high access rates of such tables caused memory occupancy and cache contention issues, and weren't necessarily more efficacious than the rotated bitboard approach.
Today, game programs remain divided, with the best scheme being application dependent.

Other games
Many other games besides chess benefit from bitboards.

 In Connect Four, they allow for very efficient testing for four consecutive discs, by just two shift + AND operations per direction.
 In the Conway's Game of Life, they are a possible alternative to arrays.

444,34407588,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%20Vikas,Gram Vikas,"Gram Vikas is an Indian non-governmental organisation based in Odisha, and founded in 1979. Gram Vikas works towards enabling rural communities to lead a dignified life. This is done by building capabilities of village communities, strengthening community institutions and mobilising resources. Gram Vikas works on six focus areas which are water, livelihoods, sanitation & hygiene, habitat & technologies, village institutions and education.

""Gram Vikas"" translates to ""village development"", both in Hindi and in Odia, the official language of Odisha.

History

Origins
Led by Joe Madiath, 400 volunteers from the Young Students Movement for Development, Chennai came to Odisha after the 1971 cyclone to undertake relief and rehabilitation work in the affected areas. They worked in villages in the then Cuttack district developing lift irrigation projects. This helped increase agricultural productivity for the farmers, but had little impact on the poor, who were mostly landless. Looking to do more work with the poor, they accepted an invitation from the Ganjam district administration to work with Adivasi communities in the district. The original plan was to develop a dairy cooperative. The team soon realized that working on dairy development will not benefit the tribal communities.

Mobilization for rights & development: 1979 onwards
The Kondh tribe of the Kerandimal hills in Ganjam district were suffering at the hands of liquor merchants and from land alienation. The Kerandimal Gana Sangathan was mobilized as a movement of the Adivasi community to obtain their rights to address the development needs of the villages. The Adivasi Bhumi Adhikar Sangha, a peoples’ movement in Thuamul Rampur block of Kalahandi, successfully resisted the move to convert tribal agricultural lands into tea plantations and were able to retain control over their land.

The organisation then expanded its work to cover areas in Gajapati and Kalahandi districts working with Saura and Kondh tribes. The Integrated Tribal Development Programme supported village communities in community health, non-formal education, small savings and forest protection. Village Water & Sanitation Committees have been supported, to anchor, own and, manage community access to safe sanitation and water. VWSCs have been the key community institution interface for Gram Vikas since 1998.

Education: 1982 onwards
In remote tribal villages, government schools either did not exist or were not functioning. Education levels were very poor and the exploitation of people because illiteracy was high. Gram Vikas started balwadis, non-formal education centres and adult literacy programme in the Villages. Soon it became clear that NFE would never give tribal children the opportunity to join the mainstream education system and fully reach their potential. To meet this need, Kerandimal Middle Education School, a residential school for tribal children was established at Konkia, Ganjam district in 1982.

The four residential schools, managed now by independent trusts, cater to more than 1200 boys and girls from remote tribal villages. Mahendratanaya Ashram School was established at Koinpur, Gajapati district in 1992. In 1995, the KME school was upgraded as the Gram Vikas Residential School. Gram Vikas Shikhya Niketan was established at Kumudabahal in Kalahandi district in 1998. Gram Vikas Vidya Vihar was started in Rudhapadar, Ganjam district in 1992.

Renewable Energy: 1982 onwards
Dwindling tree cover increased drudgery of women in collecting fuel for cooking. Biogas was identified as an appropriate technology alternative to address this. Between 1983 and 1993, Gram Vikas built 54,000 biogas plants across villages of Odisha. Gram Vikas has continued to adapt, demystify and disseminate renewable energy technologies for rural development. Work in solar PV, micro-hydro and biofuels for power generation and water pumping.

Natural Resource Management: 1985 onwards
To address challenges to livelihood security faced by the tribal communities, due to massive deforestation, Gram Vikas initiated the Social forestry Programme in 1985. About 10,000 hectares of private & community wasteland were brought under fruit, fuel & timber yielding species in Ganjam, Gajapati & Kalahandi districts. The tribals of Odisha practice shifting or slash-burn cultivation on hill slopes. Reduced access to common land due to stringent laws resulted in reduced rotation cycles in this practice and the degradation of land. Horticulture interventions and integrated land and water management measures were adopted to address this. Recurring droughts in the region also prompted focus on land and water management based on watershed principles. Water harvesting structures, soil conservation measures and drainage line treatment were taken up on a ridge-to-valley principle. Work on natural resource management also expanded to include the chronic drought-prone areas of Bolangir and Bargarh districts.

Habitat Development: 1995 onwards
Enabling rural communities to lead a dignified life meant supporting improvements in the physical living environment. Regular natural hazards like cyclone affect lives in coastal Odisha, causing damage to homes and property. Gram Vikas supports rural communities to build cost-effective, disaster-proof houses; community buildings and facilities such as schools, grain banks, roads, drainage etc.

Water & Sanitation: 1994 onwards
The high levels of morbidity caused by pollution of drinking water sources through improper disposal of human waste need to be addressed through a community-managed, all-inclusive mechanism. The Rural Health & Environment Programme was developed by Gram Vikas in 1995 through wide consultations with village communities in different parts of Odisha.

Activities
Since its inception, Gram Vikas has worked on a variety of development issues, including biogas promotion, community forestry, rural habitat development, and education. Since 2019, Gram Vikas has been working on six focus areas which are water, livelihoods, sanitation & hygiene, habitat & technologies, village institutions and education.

Water
Gram Vikas mobilises and supports village communities to build and manage their own piped water supply systems and ensure continuous availability of clean water for drinking and domestic uses. Water integrated with sanitation facilities enable households to adopt safe sanitation practices and reduce drudgery for women. Awareness, knowledge and processes to ensure sustainability of water sources lead to communities becoming water secure in the long run.

Livelihoods
Gram Vikas ensures the sustainability of land and forest resources, skills people and creates diversified and secure income sources. Tribal communities access their rights over forests. They gain new knowledge in using natural resources thereby improving the land quality and making it more productive.

Sanitation and Hygiene
The organisation motivates communities to adopt safe sanitation and hygiene behaviour and helps them with building household infrastructure. This integrated water and sanitation model reduces incidences of water-borne diseases and lowers malnutrition rates thereby keeping children and families healthy. Access to private, safe toilets and bathrooms with water affords women dignity and reduces the daily drudgery of fetching and carrying water.

Habitat and Technologies
The organisation has been promoting the use of renewable and appropriate technologies in energy and housing. Together with communities, they build disaster-resistant houses making lives secure during natural disasters. Sustainable energy solutions bring water to and light up households in remote off-grid tribal villages.

Village Institutions
Gram Vikas has been building village-level capabilities, structures and processes to enable stronger self-governance by the communities. The design of these structures and the principles of the processes ensure that women participate and lead. Community institutions take the leadership to influence local government decisions and stake claims to their rightful share in the resources deployed locally.

Education
The organisation supports Gram Vikas residential schools to provide high-quality and technology up-to-date education for children from Adivasi communities. Children go back to their communities as role models and inspire other families to educate their children. The special focus on girls results in equal or more number of girls, from communities that have historically had few educated girls, completing school.

Outreach
Gram Vikas’ work has reached 1700 villages, supporting 600,000 people. The organisation's work has ensured the 2,11,907 women have access to safe, private bathrooms with running water and 54,000 families have renewable energy sources for cooking. Work with village communities has resulted in 10,000 hectares of wasteland being regenerated for natural resources-based livelihoods.

446,6560729,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovada,Ovada,"Ovada (Uà and Guà in Ligurian, Ovà  in Piedmontese) is a comune (municipality) of 11,484 inhabitants in the Province of Alessandria in the northern Italian region Piedmont, located about  southeast of Turin and about  south of Alessandria.

Ovada is the main comune of the Ovadese area, an area of the Lower Piedmont and Upper Montferrat, located in the southern portion of the province of Alessandria.

Geography

The area, located on the northern foothills of the Ligurian-Piedmontese Apennines and at the entrance of the Stura valley leading to the Turchino pass, is hilly, tending to mountainous heading south, with plains where agriculture is practiced and where the industries have established their factories near the main connections. The city lies on the confluence of the Stura of Ovada torrent into the Orba river, at an altitude of 186 meters above sea level.

The fauna includes badgers, dormice, deer, wild boar, martens, squirrels, hares, partridges, foxes and weasels. There are also nocturnal birds like owls, hawks, kestrels and buzzards. The more frequent  fish is trout.

Climate
The climate is temperate with quite marked features of continental climate. Being protected from the south by the south and south-west winds by the chain of the Apennines, the winters have moderate snowfalls: Ovada receives more snowfall than other Italian towns located at the same altitude since the territory of the low Alessandrino and generally in Lower Piedmont, is often home to major inversions that warm southerly winds fail to unseat. Also for this reason, morning temperatures in winter easily drop below 0 °C. The close proximity to the Ligurian Sea (less than 25 km), where  cyclones often dig deep minimum of low pressure, combined with the orographic lift effect of the Apennines south of Ovada, mean that precipitation proves fairly abundant especially in the autumn months. Spring is often very windy and moderately rainy. Summer in Ovada is the driest season, unlike the rest of the Piedmont (where, due to the proximity of the Alps, storms often form). Remaining, even in summer, rather windy, the summer weather in Ovada hardly looks sultry and temperatures only during strong African heat waves exceed 30 °C. In the fall with the return of the Atlantic cyclones the weather is often overcast and rainy, and occasionally the fog appears, although much less than in other areas of Piedmont and the Po Valley.  Ovada is also affected for a few days a year of moist air coming from the Ligurian Sea, called Marin, which in some cases can even lead the smell of salt air in these territories and mild temperatures even in winter.

459,23306893,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der,Gerhard Schröder,"Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schröder (; born 7 April 1944) is a German retired politician, consultant and lobbyist, who served as the chancellor of Germany from 1998 to 2005, during which his most important political initiative was Nord Stream. As Chancellor, he led a coalition government of his Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Alliance 90/The Greens. From 1999 to 2004 he was the Leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Schröder was nominated to become a director of the Russian state owned company Gazprom in February 2022 and has been chairman of Russian energy company Rosneft since 2017.

Before becoming a full-time politician, he was a lawyer, and before becoming Chancellor he served as Minister President of Lower Saxony (1990–1998). Following the 2005 federal election, which his party lost, after three weeks of negotiations he stood down as Chancellor in favour of Angela Merkel of the rival Christian Democratic Union. He is currently the chairman of the board of Nord Stream AG and of Rosneft, after having been hired as a global manager by investment bank Rothschild, and also the chairman of the board of football club Hannover 96.

Schröder has been criticized of colluding with Putin's Russia and thus being complicit in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On March 1, 2022, Schröder’s entire staff including long-time office manager Albrecht Funk resigned due to Schröder’s alliances with Russia and Vladimir Putin directly.

Early life and education
Schröder was born in Blomberg, Lippe, in the Greater German Reich. His father, Fritz Schröder, a lance corporal in the Wehrmacht, was killed in action in World War II in Romania on 4 October 1944, almost six months after Gerhard's birth. His mother, Erika (née Vosseler), worked as an agricultural labourer to support herself and her two sons.

Schröder completed an apprenticeship in retail sales in a Lemgo hardware shop from 1958 to 1961 and subsequently worked in a Lage retail shop and after that as an unskilled construction worker and a sales clerk in Göttingen while studying at night school for a general qualification for university entrance (Abitur). He did not have to do military service because his father had died in the war. In 1966, Schröder secured entrance to a university, passing the Abitur exam at Westfalen-Kolleg, Bielefeld. From 1966 to 1971 he studied law at the University of Göttingen. In 1976, he passed his second law examination, and he subsequently worked as a lawyer until 1990.

Among his more controversial cases, Schröder helped Horst Mahler, a founding member of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist group, to secure both an early release from prison and permission to practice law again in Germany.

Early political career
Schröder joined the Social Democratic Party in 1963. In 1978 he became the federal chairman of the Young Socialists, the youth organisation of the SPD. He spoke for the dissident Rudolf Bahro, as did President Jimmy Carter, Herbert Marcuse, and Wolf Biermann.

Member of the German Bundestag, 1980–1986
In 1980, Schröder was elected to the German Bundestag (federal parliament), where he wore a sweater instead of the traditional suit. Under the leadership of successive chairmen Herbert Wehner (1980–83) and Hans-Jochen Vogel (1983–86), he served in the SPD parliamentary group. He also became chairman of the SPD Hanover district.

Considered ambitious from early on in his political career, it was widely reported and never denied, that in 1982, a drunken Schröder stood outside the West German federal chancellery yelling: ""I want to get in."" That same year, he wrote an article on the idea of a red/green coalition for a book at Olle & Wolter, Berlin; this appeared later in Die Zeit. Chancellor Willy Brandt, the SPD and SI chairman, who reviewed Olle & Wolter at that time, had just asked for more books on the subject.

In 1985, Schröder met the GDR leader Erich Honecker during a visit to East Berlin. In 1986, Schröder was elected to the parliament of Lower Saxony and became leader of the SPD group.

Minister-President of Lower Saxony, 1990–1998
After the SPD won the state elections in June 1990, Schröder became Minister-President of Lower Saxony as head of an SPD-Greens coalition; in this position, he also won the 1994 and 1998 state elections. He was subsequently also appointed to the supervisory board of Volkswagen, the largest company in Lower Saxony and of which the state of Lower Saxony is a major stockholder.

Following his election as Minister-President in 1990, Schröder also became a member of the board of the federal SPD. In 1997 and 1998, he served as President of the Bundesrat. Between 1994 and 1998, he was also chairman of Lower Saxonian SPD.

During Schröder's time in office, first in coalition with the environmentalist Green Party, then with a clear majority, Lower Saxony became one of the most deficit-ridden of Germany's 16 federal states and unemployment rose higher than the national average of 12 percent. Ahead of the 1994 elections, SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping included Schröder in his shadow cabinet for the party's campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Kohl as Chancellor. During the campaign, Schröder served as shadow minister of economic affairs, energy and transport.

In 1996, Schröder caused controversy by taking a free ride on the Volkswagen corporate jet to attend the Vienna Opera Ball, along with Volkswagen CEO Ferdinand Piëch. The following year, he nationalized a big steel mill in Lower Saxony to preserve jobs.

In the 1998 state elections, Schöder's Social Democrats increased their share of the vote by about four percentage points over the 44.3 percent they recorded in the previous elections in 1994 – a postwar record for the party in Lower Saxony that reversed a string of Social Democrat reversals in state elections elsewhere.

Chancellor of Germany, 1998–2005

First term, 1998–2002

Following the 1998 national elections, Schröder became Chancellor as head of an SPD-Green coalition. Throughout his campaign for Chancellor, he portrayed himself as a pragmatic new Social Democrat who would promote economic growth while strengthening Germany's generous social welfare system.

After the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine as Leader of the Social Democratic Party in March 1999, in protest at Schröder's adoption of a number of what Lafontaine considered ""neo-liberal"" policies, Schröder took over his rival's office as well. In April 1999, in Germany's first session in the restored Reichstag, to applause he quoted Albanian writer Ismail Kadare, saying: ""The Balkans is the yard of the European house, and in no house can peace prevail so long as people kill each other in its yard."" In a move meant to signal a deepening alliance between Schröder and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom, the two leaders issued an eighteen-page manifesto for economic reform in June 1999. Titled ""Europe: The Third Way"", or ""Die Neue Mitte"" in German, it called on Europe's centre-left governments to cut taxes, pursue labour and welfare reforms and encourage entrepreneurship. The joint paper said European governments needed to adopt a ""supply-side agenda"" to respond to globalisation, the demands of capital markets and technological change.

Schröder's efforts backfired within his own party, where its left-wing rejected the Schröder–Blair call for cutbacks to the welfare state and pro-business policies. Instead, the paper took part of the blame for a succession of six German state election losses in 1999 for the Social Democratic Party. Only by 2000, Schröder managed to capitalise on the donations scandal of his Christian Democratic opposition to push through a landmark tax reform bill and re-establish his dominance of the German political scene.

Schröder's tenure oversaw the seat of government move from Bonn to Berlin. In May 2001, Schröder moved to his new official residence, the Federal Chancellery in Berlin, almost two years after the city became the seat of the German Government. He had previously been working out of the building in eastern Berlin used by the former leaders of East Germany.

Second term, 2002–2005

Throughout the build-up to the 2002 German election, the Social Democrats and the Green Party trailed the centre-right candidate Edmund Stoiber until the catastrophe caused by rising floodwater in Germany led to an improvement in his polling numbers. Furthermore, his popular opposition to a war in Iraq dominated campaigning in the run-up to the polls. At 22 September 2002 vote, he secured another four-year term, with a narrow nine-seat majority down from 21.

In February 2004, Schröder resigned as chairman of the SPD amid growing criticism from across his own party of his reform agenda; Franz Müntefering succeeded him as chairman. On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats (CDU) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections ""as soon as possible"". A motion of confidence was subsequently defeated in the Bundestag on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. In response, a grouping of left-wing SPD dissidents and the Party of Democratic Socialism agreed to run on a joint ticket in the general election, with Schröder's rival Oskar Lafontaine leading the new group.

The 2005 German federal elections were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schröder's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by Angela Merkel achieved a majority in parliament, but the CDU/CSU had a stronger popular electoral lead by one percentage point. On election night, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory and chancellorship, but after initially ruling out a grand coalition with Merkel, Schröder and Müntefering entered negotiations with her and the CSU's Edmund Stoiber. On 10 October, it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a grand coalition. Schröder agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy. Merkel was elected chancellor on 22 November.

On 11 October 2005, Schröder announced that he would not take a post in the new cabinet and, in November, he confirmed that he would leave politics as soon as Merkel took office. On 23 November 2005, he resigned his Bundestag seat.

On 14 November 2005, at a SPD conference in Karlsruhe, Schröder urged members of the SPD to support the proposed coalition, saying it ""carries unmistakably, perhaps primarily, the imprint of the Social Democrats"". Many SPD members had previously indicated that they supported the coalition, which would have continued the policies of Schröder's government, but had objected to Angela Merkel replacing him as Chancellor. The conference voted overwhelmingly to approve the deal.

Domestic policies

In his first term, Schröder's government decided to phase out nuclear power, fund renewable energies, institute civil unions for same-sex partners, and liberalise the naturalization law.

During Schröder's time in office, economic growth slowed to only 0.2% in 2002 and Gross Domestic Product shrank in 2003, while German unemployment was over the 10% mark. Most voters soon associated Schröder with the Agenda 2010 reform program, which included cuts in the social welfare system (national health insurance, unemployment payments, pensions), lower taxes, and reformed regulations on employment and payment. He also eliminated capital gains tax on the sale of corporate stocks and thereby made the country more attractive to foreign investors.

After the 2002 election, the SPD steadily lost support in opinion polls. Many increasingly perceived Schröder's Third Way program to be a dismantling of the German welfare state. Moreover, Germany's high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government. Schröder's tax policies were also unpopular; when the satirical radio show The Gerd Show released ""Der Steuersong"", featuring Schröder's voice (by impressionist Elmar Brandt) lampooning Germany's indirect taxation with the lyrics ""Dog tax, tobacco tax, emissions and environmental tax, did you really think more weren't coming?"", it became Germany's 2002 Christmas #1 hit and sold over a million copies. The fact that Schröder served on the Volkswagen board (a position that came with his position as minister-president of Lower Saxony) and tended to prefer pro-car policies led to him being nicknamed the ""Auto-Kanzler"" (car chancellor).

European integration
In 1997, Schröder joined the ministers-president of two other German states, Kurt Biedenkopf and Edmund Stoiber, in making the case for a five-year delay in Europe's currency union. After taking office, he made his first official trip overseas to France for meetings with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in October 1998. A 2001 meeting held by both leaders in Blaesheim later gave the name to a regular series of informal meetings between the French President, the German Chancellor, and their foreign ministers. The meetings were held alternately in France and Germany. At the fortieth anniversary of the Elysée Treaty, both sides agreed that rather than summits being held twice a year, there would now be regular meetings of a council of French and German ministers overseen by their respective foreign affairs ministers. In an unprecedented move, Chirac formally agreed to represent Schröder in his absence at a European Council meeting in October 2003.

In his first months in office, Schröder vigorously demanded that Germany's net annual contribution of about $12,000,000,000 to the budget of the European Union be cut, saying his country was paying most for European ""waste."" He later moderated his views when his government held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 1999.

In 2003, Schröder and Chirac agreed to share power in the institutions of the European Union between a President of the European Commission, elected by the European Parliament, and a full-time President of the European Council, chosen by heads of state and government; their agreement later formed the basis of discussions at the Convention on the Future of Europe and became law with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Ahead of the French referendum on a European Constitution, Schröder joined Chirac in urging French voters to back the new treaty, which would have enshrined new rules for the expanded EU of 25 member states and widened the areas of collective action.

Also in 2003, both Schröder and Chirac forced a suspension of sanctions both faced for breaching the European Union's fiscal rules that underpin the euro – the Stability and Growth Pact – for three years in a row. Schröder later called for a revision of the Lisbon Strategy and thereby a retreat from Europe's goal of overtaking the United States as the world's most competitive economy by 2010. Instead, he urged the EU to reform the Pact to encourage growth, and to seek the reorientation of the €100,000,000,000 annual EU budget towards research and innovation. By 2005, he had successfully pushed for an agreement on sweeping plans to rewrite the Pact, which now allowed EU members with deficits above the original 3% of GDP limit to cite the costs of ""the reunification of Europe"" as a mitigating factor.

Schröder was regarded a strong ally of Prime Minister Leszek Miller of Poland and supporter of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. On 1 August 2004, the sixtieth anniversary of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, he apologised to Poland for ""the immeasurable suffering"" of its people during the conflict; he was the first German Chancellor to be invited to an anniversary of the uprising. Both Schröder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also supported the accession of Turkey to the European Union.

Foreign policy

Marking a clear break with the caution of German foreign policy since World War II, Schröder laid out in 1999 his vision of the country's international role, describing Germany as ""a great power in Europe"" that would not hesitate to pursue its national interests.

Schröder also began seeking a resolution ways to compensate Nazi-era slave labourers almost as soon as he was elected Chancellor. Reversing the hard-line stance of his predecessor, Helmut Kohl, he agreed to the government contributing alongside industry to a fund that would compensate people forced to work in German factories by the Nazi regime and appointed Otto Graf Lambsdorff to represent German industry in the negotiations with survivors' organisations, American lawyers and the US government.

Schröder sent forces to Kosovo and to Afghanistan as part of NATO operations. Until Schröder's chancellorship, German troops had not taken part in combat actions since World War II. At the beginning of the Iraq crisis, Schröder declared in March 2002 that Germany would not take part in the Iraq war without a UN mandate. In the summer of 2002, during the federal election campaign, he proclaimed the ""German Way"" as an alternative to the ""American warmongering"" in Iraq and presented Germany as a peace power.

In May 2019 at WORLD.MINDS in Belgrade, 20 years to the day after the bombing of Belgrade by NATO troops, Schröder stated unequivocally that in retrospect, if he had to make the decision again, he would authorize the aerial bombardment of the former Yugoslavia again. Schröder said that ""the easiest solution would be to first accept Serbia into the European Union and then within, as an integral part the EU, find a solution [to the Kosovo issue]."" With Germany having a long experience with terrorism itself, Schröder declared solidarity with the United States after the September 11 attacks in 2001. When Schröder left office, Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States, UK, France, Canada and after two years Afghanistan.

Relations with the Middle East

During their time in government, both Schröder and his foreign minister Joschka Fischer were widely considered sincerely, if not uncritically, pro-Israel. Schröder represented the German government at the funeral service for King Hussein of Jordan in Amman on 9 February 1999.

When British planes joined United States forces bombing Iraq without consulting the United Nations Security Council in December 1998, Schröder pledged ""unlimited solidarity"". But, long with French President Jacques Chirac and many other world leaders, Schröder later spoke out strongly against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and refused any military assistance in that enterprise. Schröder's stance caused political friction between the US and Germany, in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign. Schröder's stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD. The parliamentary leader of the SPD, Ludwig Stiegler, compared US President George W. Bush to Julius Caesar while Schröder's Minister of Justice, Herta Däubler-Gmelin, likened Bush's foreign policy to that of Adolf Hitler. Schröder's critics accused him of enhancing, and campaigning on, anti-American sentiments in Germany. After his 2002 re-election, Schröder and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the US and Europe. Bush stated in his memoirs that Schröder initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion, to which Schröder responded saying that Bush was ""not telling the truth"". When asked in March 2003 if he were at all self-critical about his position on Iraq, Schröder replied, ""I very much regret there were excessive statements"" from himself and former members of his government (which capitalised on the war's unpopularity).

Relations with Russia

On his first official trip to Russia in late 1998, Schröder suggested that Germany was not likely to come up with more aid for the country. He also sought to detach himself from the close personal relationship that his predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, saying that German-Russian relations should ""develop independently of concrete political figures."" Soon after, however, he cultivated close ties with Yeltsin's successor, President Vladimir Putin, in an attempt to strengthen the ""strategic partnership"" between Berlin and Moscow, including the opening of a gas pipeline from Russian Dan Marino-Pipelines over the Baltic Sea exclusively between Russia and Germany (see ""Gazprom controversy"" below). During his time in office, he visited the country five times.

Schröder was criticised in the media, and subsequently by Angela Merkel, for calling Putin a ""flawless democrat"" on 22 November 2004, only days before Putin prematurely congratulated Viktor Yanukovich during the Orange Revolution. In 2005, Schröder suggested at the ceremonial introduction of the Airbus A380 in Toulouse that there was still ""room in the boat"" of EADS for Russia.

Only a few days after his chancellorship, Schröder joined the board of directors of the Nord Stream joint venture, thus bringing about new speculations about his prior objectivity. In his memoirs Decisions: My Life in Politics, Schröder still defends his friend and political ally, and states that ""it would be wrong to place excessive demands on Russia when it comes to the rate of domestic political reform and democratic development, or to judge it solely on the basis of the Chechnya conflict.""

Relations with China

During his time in office, Schröder visited China six times. He was the first Western politician to travel to Beijing and apologise after NATO jets had mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999. In 2004, he and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao established a secure, direct telephone line. He also pressed for the lifting of the EU arms embargo on China.

After Chancellorship

Personal life 
Schröder rents an apartment in Berlin while retaining his primary residence in Hanover. As a former Chancellor, he is entitled to a permanent office, also situated in Berlin. In late 2005, he spent time in the UK improving his English language skills.

Representative role
After leaving public office, Schröder represented Germany at the funeral services for Boris Yeltsin in Moscow (jointly with Horst Köhler and Helmut Kohl, 2007) and Fidel Castro in Santiago de Cuba (jointly with Egon Krenz, 2016).

Schröder and Kurt Biedenkopf served as mediators in a conflict over privatization plans at German railway operator Deutsche Bahn; the plans eventually fell through. In 2016, he was appointed by Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel to mediate (alongside economist Bert Rürup) in a dispute between two of Germany's leading retailers, Edeka and REWE Group, over the takeover of supermarket chain Kaiser's Tengelmann.

Following the release of German activist Peter Steudtner from a Turkish prison in October 2017, German media reported that Schröder had acted as mediator in the conflict and, on the request of Gabriel, met with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to secure the release. After the 2018 elections in Turkey, he represented the German government at Erdoğan's swearing-in ceremony in Ankara.

Business activities
Schröder's plans after leaving office as Chancellor and resigning his Bundestag seat included resuming his law practice in Berlin, writing a book, and implementing plans for twin pipelines for Gazprom, Russia's leading energy company. He was subsequently retained by the Swiss publisher Ringier AG as a consultant. Other board memberships include the following:

 Herrenknecht, Deputy Chairman of the supervisory board (since 2017)
 Nord Stream, Chairman of the Shareholders' Committee (since 2006)
 CargoBeamer, Member of the Advisory Board
 N M Rothschild & Sons, Member of the European Advisory Council (since 2006)
 Hannover 96, Chairman of the supervisory board (2016-2019)
 TNK-BP, Member of the International Advisory Board (2009)

Other activities
In addition, Schröder has held several other paid and unpaid positions since his retirement from German politics, including:
 Berggruen Institute, Member of the Council for the Future of Europe and the 21st Century Council.
 Bundesliga Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
 German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Member of the Advisory Council

Criticism and controversies

Relationship with Gazprom and Rosneft
As Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder was a strong advocate of the Nord Stream pipeline project, which now supplies Russian gas directly to Germany, thereby bypassing transit countries.

At the time of the German parliamentary election, according to Rick Noak of The Washington Post:

On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schröder stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee had never been used. Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.

German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped. In an editorial entitled Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout, the American newspaper The Washington Post also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schröder's new post. Democrat Tom Lantos, chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, likened Schröder to a ""political prostitute"" for his recent behaviour. In January 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that Schröder would join the board of the oil company TNK-BP, a joint venture between oil major BP and Russian partners.

In 2016, Schröder switched to become manager of Nord Stream 2, an expansion of the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder.

In 2017, Russia nominated Schröder to also serve as an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer Rosneft. At the time, Rosneft was under Western sanctions over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis. Schröder told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post. His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections. German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor, saying ""I do not think what Mr Schröder is doing is okay"".

Schröder also serves on the International Advisory Board of the China Investment Corporation (CIC).

Defamation lawsuit (2002)
In April 2002, Schröder sued the DDP press agency for publishing an opinion of public relations consultant Sabine Schwind saying that he ""would be more credible if he didn't dye his gray hair"". The court decided to ban the media from suggesting that he colours his hair.  The Chancellor's spokesman said: ""This is not a frivolous action taken over whether he does or doesn't dye his hair, but is a serious issue regarding his word."" The agency's lawyer said that they could not accept a verdict which ""does not coincide with freedom of the press"".

Dispute over Estonian war memorial
During a heated dispute between Russia and Estonia in May 2007 over the removal of a Soviet-era war memorial from the centre of the Estonian capital Tallinn to a military cemetery, Schröder defended the Kremlin's reaction. He remarked that Estonia had contradicted ""every form of civilised behaviour"". Consequently, the Estonian government cancelled a planned visit by Schröder in his function as chairman of Nord Stream AG, which promotes the petroleum pipeline from Russia to Germany.

Comments on Kosovo independence
Schröder has criticised some European countries' swift decision to recognise Kosovo as an independent state after it declared independence in February 2008. He believes the decision was taken under heavy pressure from the US government and has caused more problems, including the weakening of the so-called pro-EU forces in Serbia. In August 2008, Schröder laid the blame for the 2008 South Ossetia war squarely on Mikhail Saakashvili and ""the West"", hinting at American foreknowledge and refusing to criticize any aspect of Russian policy which had thus far come to light.

Comments on Crimean crisis
In March 2014, Schröder likened Russia's intervention in Crimea with NATO's intervention in Kosovo, citing both cases as violations of international law and the UN Charter. He further stated that there had been ""unhappy developments"" on the outskirts of the former Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War, leading Putin to develop justifiable ""fears about being encircled"". On 13 March 2014, an attempt by the German Green Party to ban Schröder from speaking in public about Ukraine was narrowly defeated in the European parliament. His decision to celebrate his 70th birthday party with Putin in Saint Petersburg's Yusupov Palace in late April elicited further criticism from several members of Merkel's grand coalition, including human rights spokesperson .

Paradise Papers 
In November 2017, an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in ""Paradise Papers"" allegations.

Filmography

Television

Personal life

Schröder has been married five times: 
 Eva Schubach (married 1968, divorced 1972);
 Anne Taschenmacher (married 1972, divorced 1984);
 Hiltrud ""Hillu"" Hampel (married 1984, divorced 1997);
 Doris Köpf (married 1997, divorced 2018);
  (married 2018)

Doris Köpf had a daughter from a previous relationship with a television journalist. She lived with the couple. In July 2004, Schröder and Köpf adopted a child from Saint Petersburg. In 2006, they adopted another child from Saint Petersburg.

When not in Berlin, Schröder lives in Hanover. In 2013, Schröder and Köpf purchased another home in Gümüşlük, Turkey, in a real estate project developed by Nicolas Berggruen.

Schröder's fourth marriage has earned him the nickname ""Audi Man"", a reference to the four-ring symbol of Audi motorcars. Another nickname is ""The Lord of the Rings"".

Schröder married for the fifth time in 2018. His wife is the Korean economist and interpreter Kim So-Yeon.

Schröder's fifth marriage has earned him the nickname ""Olympic Man"", a reference to the five-ring symbol of the Olympic Games.

Schröder identifies himself as a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany, but does not appear to be religious. He did not add the optional phrase So wahr mir Gott helfe (""so help me God"") when sworn in as chancellor for his first term in 1998.

Schröder is known to be an avid art collector. He chose his friend Jörg Immendorff to paint his official portrait for the German Chancellery. The portrait, which was completed by Immendorff's assistants, was revealed to the public in January 2007; the massive work has ironic character, showing the former Chancellor in stern heroic pose, in the colors of the German flag, painted in the style of an icon, surrounded by little monkeys. These ""painter monkeys"" were a recurring theme in Immendorff's work, serving as an ironic commentary on the artist's practice. On 14 June 2007, Schröder gave a eulogy at a memorial service for Immendorf at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin.

Reception 
Schröder's close connection to Vladimir Putin and his government after his chancellorship was widely criticized in Germany.

Especially as tensions between Russia and NATO mounted ahead of the conflict over Ukraine, Schroeder's stance as a ""Putin understander"" was criticized.  Schröder critized the behaviour of the western countries as ""saber rattling."" ARD-journalist Georg Schwarte stated that, Schröder would not be any longer ""a former chancellor. At best"" , he would be a ""ex-chancellor with a sense of money."" The recent chancelor Olaf Scholz (SPD) made later clear ""I don't want his advice.""

It was described by Dru Drury in 1773. It is found in North America from southern Ontario and New Hampshire south to Georgia and west to Colorado and Texas.

The average length of a sample of forewings was 15.77 mm. The forewings are dark brown to black dorsally with pale buff to ivory bands. The ground colour of the hindwings is highly variable, ranging from yellow to scarlet or pink. The markings are black. There are two generations per year in northern Ohio. In the northern part of the range, adults are mostly on wing from May to June in one generation. In the southwest adults have been recorded on wing from April to October.

The larvae feed on various low-growing plants, including alfalfa and plantain.

This species was formerly a member of the genus Grammia, but was moved to Apantesis along with the other species of the genera Grammia, Holarctia, and Notarctia.

463,61749768,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamland%20%28Pet%20Shop%20Boys%20song%29,Dreamland (Pet Shop Boys song),"""Dreamland"" is a song by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys featuring English synth-pop band Years & Years. It was released on 11 September 2019 as the lead single from Pet Shop Boys' fourteenth studio album, Hotspot (2020).

The release of the single coincided with the announcement of Pet Shop Boys' first ever greatest hits tour, titled Dreamworld: The Greatest Hits Live which will see the duo performing in arenas around the UK.

During their headline slot at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park, Pet Shop Boys performed ""Dreamland"" live for the first time with Years & Years frontman Olly Alexander joining them on stage.

Background
During the writing process, Neil Tennant explained that the title of the track came when Alexander told the duo that he had just visited the Dreamland Margate amusement park. According to an interview in The Guardian, the trio wrote the track in 2017, with Alexander explaining, ""I felt like I didn't want to write about politics simply because I felt like I should but then last week I wrote a song with the Pet Shop Boys. It's inspired by a fairground in Margate called Dreamland, but while I was writing it, Neil Tennant said to me, 'This makes sense right now with Trump closing the borders.' The song became something that touched on what's going on in the world. I'd write lyrics and he'd say, 'No, it needs to be more direct.' He'd take a simple line and interject a subversive political statement. That's the challenge as a pop writer, to do both at once"".

Of the single, Pet Shop Boys said: ""It's so exciting that our new single is a collaboration with Years & Years, one of the most original and successful bands to emerge this decade, and we really enjoyed writing and recording it with Olly Alexander"". Alexander added, ""It was a dream come true to create something with two of my heroes, and spending time with Chris and Neil was an absolute joy. I had to pinch myself repeatedly!""

Hadromophryne natalensis is found in Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland.
It is a common species inhabiting montane forests and grasslands. It breeds in fast-flowing, perennial streams. Because the larval development takes two years, permanent streams are required for reproduction. It is potentially threatened by modifications of its habitat caused by afforestation, damming and siltation of streams, and water extraction. It is also negatively affected by the introduced trout.

Location
Carrowreagh Court Tomb is located  northwest of Aclare, high in the Slieve Gamph Mountains in the middle of a peat bog.

History
Carrowreagh Court Tomb was constructed in the Neolithic, c. 4000–2500 BC. A cist was found nearby, 30 m (33 yd) to the SW.

The court was located in the northwest. The gallery is kite-shaped with an entrance 2 m (6½ ft) wide. This widens to over 3 m (10 ft) at the jambs.  There may have been three or four terminal chambers, an unusually high number – it is hard to be exact as the stones are in disarray.

Worland was the son of C.H. ""Dad"" Worland, the founder of the town of Worland, and was a noted local entrepreneur.

The house is a good example of the Bungalow style popular at the time. It was designed and built by local contractor H.C. Shirk. The house retains its architectural integrity and is the best example of its style in Worland. The house sits on a raised concrete block basement, fronted by a large porch, now enclosed. The entrance is offset from the center, under deep overhangs and a gable detailed with flat trim. The house extends deep into the lot, deeper than it is wide, with projecting small bays on either side and a rear enclosed porch addition. The interior retains its original detailing with stained oak trim and furnishings, including bookcases with leaded glass doors, flanked by Ionic columns as room dividers. Much of the kitchen is original.

The Worlands entertained extensively, holding dances in the basement for local young people. They sold the house in 1925 to G.C. Muirhead, the president of the Stockgrowers State Bank.  The Muirhead family lived there until 1978.

The Worland House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

474,1437801,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis%20Reed,Willis Reed,"Willis Reed Jr. (born June 25, 1942) is an American retired basketball player, coach and general manager. He spent his entire professional playing career (1964–1974) with the New York Knicks. In 1982, Reed was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was voted one of the ""50 Greatest Players in NBA History"". In October 2021, Reed was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

After retiring as a player, Reed served as assistant and head coach with several teams for nearly a decade, then was promoted to general manager and vice president of basketball operations (1989–1996) for the New Jersey Nets. As senior vice president of basketball operations, he led them to the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003.

Early life and education
Reed was born on June 25, 1942, in Dubach, Louisiana within Lincoln Parish. He grew up on a farm in nearby Bernice, Louisiana. His parents worked to ensure Reed got an education in the segregated South. Reed showed athletic ability at an early age and played basketball at West Side High School in Lillie, Louisiana.

Reed attended Grambling State University, a historically black college. Playing for the Grambling State Tigers men's basketball team, Reed amassed 2,280 career points, averaging 26.6 points per game and 21.3 rebounds per game during his senior year. He led the Tigers to one NAIA title and three Southwestern Athletic Conference championships. Reed also became a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

Career
The New York Knicks selected Reed in the second round, with the eighth overall selection, in the 1964 NBA draft. Reed quickly made a name as a fierce, dominating and physical force on both ends of the floor. In March 1965, he scored 46 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, the second-highest single-game total ever by the Knicks' rookie. For the 1964–65 season, he ranked seventh in the NBA in scoring (19.5 points per game) and fifth in rebounding (14.7 rebounds per game). He also began his string of All-Star appearances and won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award while also being named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.

Reed proved to be a clutch playoff performer throughout his career. He gave an early indication of this in the 1966–67 season when he improved his regular season averages to 20.9 points per game, and scoring 27.5 points per game in the postseason.

He played center. Despite his relatively average stature for a basketball player, he made up for his lack of height by playing a physical game, often ending seasons with respectable averages in blocking and rebounding. He stood  but like common practice was listed with shoes at 6'10, when contemporaries such as Wilt Chamberlain stood  and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was  in their playing careers.

The team continued to struggle for a few years while adding good players through trades and the draft. Dick McGuire was replaced as coach with Red Holzman, midway through the 1967–68 season. The Knicks had gone 15–22 under McGuire; Holzman steered them to a 28–17 finish. In 1968, New York's record was 43–39, its first winning record since the 1958–59 season.

Reed continued to make annual appearances in the NBA All-Star Game. By this time, he was playing power forward, to make room for Walt Bellamy. Reed averaged 11.6 rebounds in 1965–66 and 14.6 in 1966–67, both top 10 marks in the league. By the latter season, he had adjusted to the nuances of his new position, averaging 20.9 points to rank eighth in the NBA.

In 1968–69, New York held opponents to a league-low 105.2 points per game. With Reed clogging the middle and Walt Frazier pressuring the ball, the Knicks would be the best defensive club in the league for five of the next six seasons.

Reed scored 21.1 points per game in 1968–69 and grabbed a franchise-record 1,191 rebounds, an average of 14.5 rebounds per game.

First championship
In the 1969–70 season, the Knicks won a franchise-record 60 games and set a then single-season NBA record with an 18-game win streak. In 1970, Reed became the first player in NBA history to be named the NBA All-Star Game MVP, the NBA regular season MVP, and the NBA Finals MVP in the same season. That same year, he was named to the All-NBA First Team and NBA All-Defensive First Team, as well as being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, and the Sporting News NBA MVP.

Reed's most famous performance took place on May 8, 1970, during game seven of the 1970 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers in Madison Square Garden. Due to a severe thigh injury, a torn muscle that had previously kept him out of game six, he was considered unlikely to play in game seven. However, Reed surprised the fans by walking onto the court during warmups, prompting widespread applause. Starting the game, he scored the Knicks' first two field goals on his first two shot attempts, his only points of the game. Following the game in the winner's locker room, a moved Howard Cosell told Reed on national television, ""You exemplify the very best that the human spirit can offer.""

Second championship
The Knicks slipped to a 52–30 record in the 1970–71 season, still good enough for first place in the Atlantic Division; and in mid-season, Reed tied Harry Gallatin's all-time club record by grabbing 33 rebounds against the Cincinnati Royals. Once again, Reed started in the All-Star Game. For the season, he averaged 20.9 points and 13.7 rebounds per game, but the Knicks were eliminated by the Baltimore Bullets in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1971–72, Reed was bothered by tendinitis in his left knee, limiting his mobility. He missed two weeks early in the season and returned, but shortly thereafter the injured knee prohibited him from playing, and he totaled 11 games for the year. Without Reed, the Knicks still managed to make the NBA Finals, but were defeated in five games by the Los Angeles Lakers.

The 1972–73 Knicks finished the season with a 57–25 record and went on to win another NBA title. Reed was less of a contributor than he was two seasons earlier. In 69 regular season games, he averaged only 11.0 points. In the playoffs, the Knicks beat the Bullets and upset the Boston Celtics, and again faced the Lakers in the NBA Finals. After losing the first game, the Knicks captured four straight, claiming their second NBA championship with a 102–93 victory in game five. Reed was named NBA Finals MVP.

Reed's career was cut short by injuries, and he retired after the 1973–74 season. For his career, Reed averaged 18.7 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, playing 650 games. He played in seven All-Star Games.

Post-playing career
Reed spent several years coaching before moving into general management. He coached the Knicks in 1977–1978, and left the team 14 games into the following season (49–47 record). He was the head coach at Creighton University from 1981 to 1985 and volunteer assistant coach for St. John's University. Reed also served as an assistant coach for the NBA's Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings.

Reed debuted as head coach of the New Jersey Nets on March 1, 1988, one week after the Nets' star forward (and Reed's cousin) Orlando Woolridge was suspended by the league and was to undergo drug rehabilitation. He compiled a 33–77 record with the Nets. In 1989, he was hired as the Nets' general manager and vice president of basketball operations (1989–1996). During this time, he drafted Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson, acquired Dražen Petrović, and made the Nets a playoff contender throughout the early 1990s. Reed hired Chuck Daly to coach the Nets for the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. In 1996, Reed moved to the position of senior vice president of basketball operations, with the continued goal of building the Nets into a championship contender. The Nets made the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003.

Reed next took the position of vice president of basketball operations with the New Orleans Hornets in 2004. He retired from that position in 2007.

In popular media
Rap songs have mentioned Reed, recognizing his impressive athleticism and skill. Examples include Kurtis Blow's 1984 hit ""Basketball"" on his Ego Trip album, and the Beastie Boys' ""Long Burn The Fire"" on their 2011 album Hot Sauce Committee Part Two.

Reed's name has become synonymous with playing through injury, as Cris Collinsworth described an injured Aaron Rodgers as having a ""Willis Reed kind of night"" on the NBC Sunday Night Football broadcast on September 9, 2018.

476,4196017,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20craft,American craft,"American craft is craft work produced by independent studio artists working with traditional craft materials and processes. Examples include wood (woodworking and furniture making), glass (glassblowing and lampworking),  clay (ceramics), textiles, and metal (metalworking). Studio craft works tend to either serve or allude to a functional or utilitarian purpose, although they are just as often handled and exhibited in ways similar to visual art objects.

History
The American studio craft movement is a successor to earlier European craft movements.  Modern studio crafts developed as a reaction to modernity and, particularly, the Industrial Revolution.  During the nineteenth century, Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle and English social critic John Ruskin warned of the extinction of handicrafts in Europe.  English designer and theorist William Morris continued this line of thought, becoming father of England's Arts & Crafts Movement.  Morris distinguished the studio craftsman in this way:  ""[O]ur art is the work of a small minority composed of educated persons, fully conscious of their aim of producing beauty, and distinguished from the great body of workmen by that aim.""  Both European and American craft traditions have also been influenced by Art Nouveau.  Both of these movements influenced the development of the contemporary studio craft movement in the United States during the late nineteenth century, throughout the twentieth century and to the present.

American craft pioneers
In the early nineteenth century it became popular for rural Americans of modest means to take the decoration of their homes and furniture into their own hands. The artist Rufus Porter was an early proponent of the American craft movement. In 1825 he published  A Select Collection of Valuable and Curious Arts, and Interesting Experiments Which are Well Explained, and Warranted Genuine, and May be Prepared, Safely and at Little Expense, which is a book of instructions for domestic decorative arts, including wall, floor, and furniture painting.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the preindustrial craft trades had almost disappeared.  Industrial expansion and westward movement had largely severed American culture from early Colonial American and Native American craft roots.  Against this backdrop, Louis Comfort Tiffany was a pioneer of the American craft movement, arguing for the placement of well-designed and crafted objects in the American home.  Tiffany's elegant stained glass creations were influenced by the values of William Morris and became America's leading embodiment of art nouveau.

Gustav Stickley, the cabinetmaker, was an early leader in the development of Studio Furniture and the American craft movement.  Stickley's designs were distinguished by their simplicity and by their harmony between interior decorative art and architecture.  Stickley's magazine, ""The Craftsman,"" was a forum for this movement from 1901 through 1916.  Originally focused on expounding ideas from the England's Arts and Crafts Movement, ""The Craftsman"" increasingly developed American craft concepts over the years of its publication. Stickley's ideas later had influence on Frank Lloyd Wright and future generations of American craftsmen, artists and architects.

The Roycroft movement was an American adaptation of the British arts and crafts movement founded by Elbert Hubbard and his wife Bertha Crawford Hubbard in the small-town of East Aurora, New York in 1895.  Its focus was on writing and publishing ornate books, but it also made furniture and metal products. Roycroft was organized as a living/working artisans' community along the lines of a Medieval European guild.

Early craft institutions
  
The studio crafts movement was fostered by the establishment of crafts programs within post-secondary educational institutions.  In 1894, for example, North America's first university ceramics department was begun at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.  This was followed in 1901 by the establishment of the first ceramics art school at Alfred University in Alfred, New York.  Similarly, the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island established the first metal arts class in 1901 and the first textiles class in 1903.

After World War I, a postwar spirit of internationalism influenced the establishment of other important craft institutions, such as the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.  Cranbrook craftsmen translated organic and geometric forms into the style that would be known as Art Deco.  At Cranbrook, teachers like Maija Grotell produced important work in their own right while also teaching a new generation of young studio craft artists.

The Depression years and World War II
During the Depression years, the federal Works Progress Administration funded crafts projects as well as public works and murals as a way to both keep workers working and as a way to increase national morale.  This enabled crafts to flourish at a local level.  At the same time, American art programs began to include craft studies into their curricula.

World War II brought an influx of European artists and craftsmen. These European exiles brought with them a range of historical traditions including not only European craft practices but also knowledge of Asian and other non-Western cultures. One example of this influx is Tage Frid, a Danish furniture maker, who established the reputation of the Furniture Making program at Rhode Island School of Design, and there are certainly others. Also during the post World War II period a general dissatisfaction with industrial society began to fuel further support for handmade art objects.  In 1943, the American Craft Council was founded to support craftspeople and cultivate an appreciation for their work.  The ACC's founder, Aileen Osborn Webb was a potter interested in creating marketing opportunities for studio craftsmen.  The organization eventually grew to include American Craft magazine and the Museum of Arts and Design (then called the Museum of Contemporary Crafts and at one point known as the American Craft Museum).  As a result of these phenomena, post-war American craft became stylistically more refined as well as technically more proficient.

The 1950s and Peter Voulkos

During the 1950s, some artists turned to the truth-to-materials doctrine.  This movement entailed an emphasis on the collective production of crafts work.  Craftsmen sometimes worked together during this period to develop more ambitious projects.   Throughout the 1950s and afterwards, potter Peter Voulkos developed increasingly largescale and nontraditional ceramic works, influenced by Abstract Expressionism, which transformed traditional understandings of the craft media.  Like the Abstract Expressionists, Voulkos emphasized performance, process and primal expression in his ceramic forms.  In some cases, Voulkos deconstructed and reconstructed traditional ceramic vessel forms such as plates, ice buckets, and tea bowls.  In other works, Voulkos created new nonutilitarian forms, such as his purely sculptural, large-scale cylindrical ""stacks.""

Voulkos was also influenced by Zen Buddhism after a 1952 encounter with Japanese potter Shoji Hamada.  Hamada encouraged Voulkos to embrace a Zen approach to ceramics based not only upon technical proficiency but also upon a mental and spiritual union between creator and art object.  Voulkos later cited Hamada's statement that it ""took him ten years to learn the potter's wheel and another ten years to forget it""—an insight that inspired Voulkos' early attempts to fully form a teapot in two minutes.

Voulkos taught at Black Mountain College in 1953, where he was further exposed to the avant-garde movements.   In 1954, he founded the ceramics department at the Otis College of Art and Design (then called the Los Angeles County Art Institute).  In California, Voulkos' pottery rapidly became abstract and sculptural.  Voulkos then moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he founded another ceramics department and taught from 1959 until 1985.  At Berkeley, Voulkos became increasingly prominent for his massive, cracked and slashed pots.

The 1960s and the new glassblowing movement
The culture of the 1960s was even more conducive to the development of studio crafts.  This period saw a rejection of materialism and exploration of alternative ways of living.  For some, the creation of handicrafts provided just such an outlet.  In 1962, then-ceramics professor Harvey Littleton and chemist Dominick Labino began the contemporary  glassblowing movement.  The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Thus Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. Harvey Littleton extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching.  Over the years, Harvey Littleton trained many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including Marvin Lipofsky, Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and Dale Chihuly.  These Littleton students in turn developed the new movement and spread it across the country.  Marvin Lipofsky, for example, is credited with being one of the founders of the Glass Art Society and introducing studio glass to California.   In 1967, Lipofsky founded the glass program at the California College of Arts and Crafts, which he headed for two decades.

In 1971, Dale Chihuly and Ruth Tamara began the influential Pilchuck Glass School near the rural town of Stanwood, Washington, financially supported by John and Anne Hauberg who supported the idea for a glass-blowing summer school program in the rural Northwest. The subsequent development of this program became the Pilchuck Glass School.Influenced by the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts (the first school to have a glass furnace), and the Penland School of Crafts,  Pilchuck Glass School has become a center of the contemporary American studio glass movement, of which Chihuly is a leading figure. Artist Toots Zynsky, a Pilchuck pioneer, observed that the choice of a Western location for the school reflected a conscious rejection of the Eastern art establishment. The naming of the school also reflected the founders' countercultural attraction to Native American culture.  Chihuly chose the name ""Pilchuck,"" derived from the Chinookan words for ""red"" and ""water,"" alluding to the iron-rich waters of the nearby Pilchuck River.

The Renwick Gallery

In 1972, the Smithsonian Institution's Renwick Gallery was founded as a studio craft department of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Housed in the original Corcoran Gallery of Art building across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, it provided a distinguished setting for American studio craft objects in Washington, D.C.

The Year of American Craft
In 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed a proclamation designating 1993 as The Year of American Craft.  As part of this commemoration, Renwick Gallery director Michael Monroe selected seventy-two works by seventy American craftsmen which were donated to the White House to serve as The White House Collection of American Crafts.  This collection was displayed for four months at the National Museum of American Art in 1995.

478,10616068,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef%20Hirsch%20Dunner,Josef Hirsch Dunner,"Rabbi Josef Hirsch Dunner (4 January 1913 – 1 April 2007), aka ""Harav Yosef Tzvi Halevi Dunner"", was a distinguished hareidi rabbi from Germany, who spent most of his life in London, England. He served as Chief Rabbi of East Prussia before World War II, and as Rabbi of the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations in London from 1960 to 2007. He also served as the rabbi of the Adath Yisroel Synagogue, set up the London Beis Yaakov Seminary and was the European President of Agudath Yisroel.

Early years
Josef Hirsch Dunner was born in Cologne, Germany on 4 January 1913, and named after his grandfather's oldest brother, a former Chief Rabbi of Amsterdam. His father was Boruch Chaim Dunner. He completed his rabbinical studies at the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary (Rabbiner Seminar für das Orthodoxe Judenthum) in Berlin under Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg, author of Seridei Eish, in 1936.

Königsberg
In 1936 Josef Dunner was appointed Chief Rabbi of East Prussia, serving in its capital, Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). While serving the needs of the large Hareidi community of East Prussia, he fought a relentless battle against Reform. In 1937 he married Ida Freyhan, daughter of Zev Freyhan, a founding member of Agudath Yisroel. In November 1938 he was arrested as part of the Kristallnacht pogrom. The Nazi authorities were, however, prevented from moving him to the Dachau concentration camp as that entailed a land journey through Poland, which refused to allow access to its territory for the transport of political prisoners. His wife then contacted Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld in London, who obtained a precious rabbi's visa for Josef Dunner, his wife and year-old son, Avrohom (1937–2011; known as Aba).

In the UK
On arrival in England Josef Dunner became the rabbi of the Westcliff Jewish community. In 1940 the British Government interned him, along with other Jews of German nationality, on the Isle of Man. At the internment camp he kept up the spirits of his fellow Jewish internees, many of whom were thoroughly demoralised by the experience of being interned together with German Nazis.
After his release from internment, he was appointed to be minister to the Jewish community in Leicester which, at that time, included many servicemen and evacuees. He built relationships in those years which endured for the remainder of his life.

London 1947–2007
In 1947 Dunner was brought by Schonfeld to Stamford Hill in north London, and here was to spend the rest of his life. In London, with the help of Rabbi Schonfeld, Dunner set up the London Beis Yaakov Seminary for girls of post-school age, one of the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. Previously, it had been possible for the daughters of Orthodox Jewish families in London to be sent to the Continent to complete their studies, but this was no longer an option after the Holocaust.
He continued to head the Beis Yaakov Seminary until the mid-1990s, when he handed leadership of the institution to his nephew, Rabbi Binyomin Dunner.

Leadership of Orthodox Jewry in the UK
Dunner succeeded Schonfeld in 1960 as head of the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, the umbrella organisation of chareidi Jewry in London, and as rabbi of Adath Yisroel. He retained both positions to the end of his life. He was also a critical figure in the Jewish Secondary Schools Movement, which had been started by Schonfeld during the Second World War to provide a more strictly Orthodox education than the diluted variant found in long-established foundations such as the Jews' Free School.

Dunner further imbued the JSSM with the philosophy of ""Torah im Derech Eretz"", pioneered by the great Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch—the 19th-century father of German ""neo-Orthodoxy"". The concept of ""Torah im Derech Eretz"" means ensuring that one is thoroughly educated in both Jewish and secular subjects. Its adherents strictly observe orthodox Judaism whilst at the same time are actively engaged in wider society as loyal citizens of the country of their residence.

Dunner also subsequently served as European President of Agudath Israel, the main organisation representing the political interests of azionistic Orthodox Jews. He was an unbending supporter of the right of Jews to practise shechita in the UK, in the face of numerous attempts by animal rights groups to ban it. Typically, he argued that if kosher meat had to be imported, the costs would become so prohibitive that the largely poor Orthodox communities of Stamford Hill and beyond would effectively be forced to become vegetarians.

Kashrus
Josef Dunner took a leading role in promoting kashrus within his community. In his early years at the Adath and UOHC he chaired the Kashrus Committee (Kedassia), where he took a personal interest in seeing that all the requirements of halacha were met. He supervised personally the baking of machine matzos for the UOHC community, first at Bonn & Co in England and later at Ludmir's matzo bakery in Jerusalem, where he lost a finger in the process of meticulously checking the machinery.

Controversy
Dunner was thrust into the public eye in 2002 when he placed an advert in the Jewish Chronicle, the UK's most prominent Jewish newspaper, along with Rabbi Bezalel Rakow, the rabbi of Gateshead, in which they expressed profound concern over passages in a slim volume, The Dignity of Difference, produced by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi.

Rabbi Sacks appeared to contend that Judaism did not necessarily possess a monopoly on spiritual truth; this would have been an unremarkable sentiment coming from a Liberal or a Reform rabbi, but coming from the best-known public face of the largest Orthodox organisation in the UK, it seemed at best ripe for misinterpretation, and at worst heresy.

""We urge Rabbi Sacks upon reflection to repudiate the thesis of the book and to withdraw the book from circulation,"" wrote Dunner and Rakow. Sacks conceded that he had been ""misunderstood"" and decided to restate his position in ""less problematic terms"" in the next edition of the book. The passages were duly revised, to the intense irritation of non-Orthodox elements.

Publications
No writings of Dunner were published during his lifetime. In 2007 his grandson Ze'ev Dunner published a collection of novellae on the Pentateuch titled ""Mikdash Halevi"" (Sanctuary of Levi). In 2006 the first volume appeared of a detailed study of Dunner's minhagim (customs), most of which were representative of the customs (""minhag Ashkenaz"") of Orthodox Jews in pre-War Germany. This volume covers the customs of the Jewish holidays. A further volume with day-to-day customs is in preparation.

Gomès was born in Algiers, Algeria. He was appointed by the Congress of New Caledonia after the provincial election held on 10 May 2009. He is backed by a wide coalition of the four main loyalists (i.e. anti-independence) parties that control 36 of the 54 seats in the Congress, now political allies after having fought each other during the campaign : The Rally–UMP, Caledonia Together (Gomès' party), Future Together and Movement for Diversity. In the Government, 7 of the 11 members come from those pro-France parties.

A former member of RPCR (older name of The Rally–UMP and historical anti-independence party in New Caledonia), Gomès left it in 2004 to found with others dissidents (like Marie-Noëlle Thémereau or Harold Martin) the Future Together (Avenir ensemble) party that defeated RPCR in the provincial election on 9 May 2004. Then, Philippe Gomès became president of the South Province, by far the most economically developed and most urbanized part of New Caledonia. After a conflict between him and some members of the party, including Harold Martin or Didier Leroux, he entered again in dissent, leaving Future Together to create his own movement called Caledonia Together (Calédonie ensemble).

He was also mayor of La Foa, a rural commune on the West Coast of Grande Terre (the main island of the archipelago), from 1989 to 2008. In this village, he notably created an annual film festival, the first and the only one in New Caledonia. Its first president was the French film director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and among his successors have included Claude Pinoteau, Jane Campion, Claude Brasseur or Patrice Leconte.

Since March 2011, he served in the New Caledonia Government, as minister for Transfers of civil security, civil and commercial rules, and of civil status.

On 17 June 2012, he was elected as member of the National Assembly of France in the 2nd constituency of New Caledonia. He joined the Union of Democrats and Independents group in the National Assembly, chaired by former minister Jean-Louis Borloo.

480,3543239,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esplanade%20Hotel%20%28Melbourne%29,Esplanade Hotel (Melbourne),"The Esplanade Hotel, commonly known locally as ""The Espy"", is a hotel and music venue in the inner bayside suburb of St Kilda, in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Built in 1878, it overlooks Port Phillip from the Upper Esplanade. It is famed for its long history of live music, and served as the filming location for the live music trivia program Rockwiz.

History 

The hotel was built in 1878 and remains one of the earliest, largest and most prominent 19th-century resort hotels in Victoria.  Originally intended to be three large terraces, the building was altered to become a hotel during construction, and became one of the premier hotels in Melbourne outside the city. The Esplanade Hotel provided rooms overlooking Port Phillip Bay, at a time when St Kilda was both a suburb of the wealthy, and the preferred place to partake of the waters in one of the many sea-bath establishments for both Melburnians and visitors.

The Esplanade Hotel was the home of wealthy philanthropist and National Gallery of Victoria benefactor Alfred Felton from 1892 until his death in 1904. The hotel also hosted many famous visitors, including Mark Twain in the 1880s, and actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1920.

A large dining room (later known as the Gershwin Room) in the rear wing was redecorated in Art Nouveau style in c1910.

In 1921 the hotel changed hands to become Carlyon’s Esplanade Hotel, and alterations were made changing it from exclusive residential use for the wealthy to incorporate entertainment for the middle classes. A ground level extension created a much larger lounge bar, and a grand staircase and entry was added. The ""Eastern Tent Ballroom"" was constructed to the rear of the site, and in the early 1920s became an important jazz and dance venue, at a time when the St Kilda foreshore area was one of the main entertainment districts in Melbourne, with numerous dance halls, cinemas, baths, hotels and an ice rink. It closed in 1925, and in 1929 the ballroom was rebuilt as the Spanish style Baymor Court flats.

Col Jackson took on the lease in 1967 and heralded a new era in music at The Espy. In the 1970s the Gershwin Room was turned into a disco, complete with flashing Saturday Night Fever-style dance floor, and later hosted live bands, as did the front bar, dubbed the Nimrod Room. From the 70s and through the 1980s and 90s, live music on up to three stages was an almost every night occurrence, as the Espy became one of the major venues of Melbourne's vibrant live music scene. By the 1980s, the upper floor guest rooms had been abandoned, and by the 1990s the Baymor Court flats were unused as well. The Esplanade Hotel was classified by the National Trust of Australia in October 1990.

The hotel was bought by Carlton and United Breweries in 1995 and then sold to Becton Corporation in 1997 with plans to develop a large residential and retail complex on the site. Becton's proposal for a 35 storey residential complex behind a partly retained hotel resulted in 9,000 residents registering objections and the trade union movement threatening to boycott construction if the pub was demolished. Community opposition supported the Espy's role in Melbourne culture and independent music scene. The eventual compromise was a lower 10 storey apartment building to the rear and side replacing rear wings, a yard, the Baymor Court flats and the bottle shop, separate from the main part of the hotel building. 

In 2001, Becton put out to tender the sale of a 200 year lease for the separated Espy Hotel. The community based Lewis/Comey/Esplanade Alliance bid was pipped by former nightclub operators Paul Adamo and Vince Sofo (who previously owned the popular Chevron nightclub in Chapel Street). Following some refurbishment the Gershwin Room at the rear reopened for live bands in 2004 and became home for the SBS television show Rockwiz. In 2006 the apartment development, designed by Fender Katsalidis, was completed. Adamo and Sofo attempted to sell the lease in early 2014, without success. They closed the hotel suddenly on 17 May 2015, with the stated intention of refurbishment, but no work happened,  with only the Gershwin Room used occasionally for special gigs.

In May 2017, The Espy was sold yet again, to Melbourne-based hospitality group Sand Hill Road, who have operated and redeveloped licensed venues since 2000. After an extensive renovation, a transformed Espy reopened in November 2018, with three live music or performance stages, numerous bars and restaurants, finally renovating and reusing all four floors, and the basement.

Music 

The Esplanade Hotel is reputed to be the longest continuously running live music venue in Australia. In May 1995, Paul Kelly recorded tracks for his album, Live at the Continental and the Esplanade (1996), in the hotel's Gershwin Room. Since 2005, the SBS music quiz show RocKwiz has been filmed in the same room. Show host Julia Zemiro used to work at the hotel as a waitress.

Travels
Between 1995 and 1998 he traveled  on a Honda Fireblade and then between 2001 and 2006 he traveled  around the world on a Yamaha YZF-R1, nicknamed Florentina. One journalist deemed the Yamaha sportbike to be ""by its nature"" inappropriate for the journey's demands of ""off-road traveling, desert and deep water crossing"". His solo travels of the 2000s are documented in the film Sjaak the World and the book Life on 2 wheels written by Lucassen. A  trip from Florida to Alaska with German long-distance rider Doris Wiedemann beginning January 2009 was documented in her 2010 book, Winter Ride to Alaska: By Motorcycle from Florida to the Shore of the Arctic Ocean. In March–April 2013, Lucassen rode from Barrow, Alaska to Key West, Florida, starting with traversal over sea ice and frozen tundra from Barrow to Nuiqsut, towing a sledge part way.

In a 2012 interview for the Royal Dutch Touring Club, Lucassen reckoned he had spent ten years of his life journeying in the saddle of a motorcycle.

Around 2015, Sjaak announced he planned to make another harrowing trip on a Yamaha YZF-R1, this time a custom build version, nicknamed aRctic1. He is planning to ride his R1 to the Northpole, starting from Anchorage, Alaska. Currently he is in the process of building his custom R1, including air suspension, by which he can raise and lower the bike some 10 inches, a 330mm front tyre from Avon and an even wider fully custom made rear tyre. Also the aRctic1 carries an onboard compressor for inflating and deflating the tyres.

Teams 
The league originally featured 60 teams. However, it saw the bankruptcy and subsequent withdrawal of Andria, Mestre, Reggiana and Vicenza.

To fill the vacancies in Serie B, Novara, Catania and Siena became the repechage candidates from Serie C, to the objection of Pro Vercelli and Ternana. However, on 10 August Lega B announced that a 19-team calendar would be commissioned for the 2018–19 and no repechage would take place.

The first team of Bassano Virtus was relocated to Vicenza as L.R. Vicenza Virtus. While its owner, had also acquired some assets from the liquidators of Vicenza.

On 3 August 2018, it was officially announced by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) that Juventus Under 23 would take part in Serie C, making it the first ""B Team"" in Italy to do so since 1934. Also, Cavese and Imolese were admitted from Serie D to fill the vacancies created.

Due to several issues regarding vacancies and trials at both Serie B and Serie C level, the Serie C league committee delayed the season kickoff day to September, also hinting at the possibility of an indefinite delay because of the unclear situation. The season eventually kicked off on Saturday 15 September, but saw all games of Novara, Pro Vercelli, Ternana, Siena and Catania delayed indefinitely due to their judicial requests to be admitted to Serie B, as well as Viterbese, after the club threatened not to participate in Serie C due to their opposition to being admitted to the Southern group. Virtus Entella's second game was also delayed after the club was accepted on appeal for being readmitted to Serie B by the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio (, TAR Lazio).

On 14 February 2019, Matera were excluded from Serie C for missing four consecutive matches which was followed by the exclusion of Pro Piacenza on 18 February 2019 after missing several games and presenting a makeshift team composed of teenagers and a physiotherapist in their final game, where they were beaten 20-0 by Cuneo.

Promotion and relegation rule changes 
On 30 January 2019, it was announced that five teams rather than the usual four would be promoted to Serie B for the 2019-20 season, after FIGC decided to incorporate an extra club in Serie B to bring the league up to 20 teams. The decision also meant that only seven clubs would be relegated to Serie D rather than the original eight.

Due to the exclusions of Pro Piacenza and Matera from the league, the football league committee, in accordance with the Italian Football Federation, agreed on 2 April 2019 to a change in the relegation rules, by decreasing the number of relegations to five as follows:

 Group A, which originally featured 20 teams, later reduced to 19 following the exclusion of Pro Piacenza, will have no direct relegation unless there are eight or more points between the last and second-last placed team at the conclusion of the regular season. In the case of less than eight points between the two bottom teams, a two-legged relegation playoff will be played.
 Group B (20 teams), as the only one that was not affected by league exclusion, will have a direct relegation for the bottom placed team in the regular season, plus a two-legged relegation playoff between the 18th and 19th placed team.
 Group C (19 teams, later reduced to 18 teams due to Matera's exclusion) will feature the same relegation system as in Group A.
 The two relegation playoff winners from Group A and Group C (or the respective second-last placed teams in the regular season, in case of no relegation playoff being held) will subsequently take part in another relegation playoff to determine the fifth team relegated to Serie D in 2019–20.

490,12591950,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Courtenay%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Devon,"William Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon","William ""Kitty"" Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon (c. 1768 – 26 May 1835), was the only son of William Courtenay, de jure 8th Earl of Devon, 2nd Viscount Courtenay and his wife Frances Clack. He attracted infamy for a homosexual affair with art collector William Beckford from boyhood when it was discovered and publicised by his uncle. From October 1788 until 1831, his official title was The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Courtenay of Powderham.

Family 
Courtenay was baptized on 30 August 1768, the fourth of 14 children (his siblings all being girls)  and was known as ""Kitty"" to family and friends. On his father's death he became The 3rd Viscount Courtenay of Powderham. With his new title and wealth, the young Lord Courtenay led an excessively flamboyant lifestyle. He was responsible for the addition of a new Music Room at Powderham Castle, designed by James Wyatt, which included a carpet made by the newly formed Axminster Carpet Company.

Homosexuality
Courtenay was in his time considered a notorious homosexual. His near neighbour and contemporary Rev. John Swete (1752–1821) of Oxton House, Kenton in Devon, wrote of him in veiled terms as follows in connection with a discussion of the Parsonage House of the parish of Powderham: 
""Unconnected with the Lord of the Castle, to me its contiguity would be considered as a drawback of no little weight; I speak as a clergyman who would be solicitous for the welfare of his flock, and who is fully satisfied that his most earnest exhortations to the poor dependants, to be zealous after God and to attend their church, would have but a momentary effect when he who should set them an example was parcus deorum cultor et infrequens"" (""Heaven's niggard and unfrequent worshipper"") (Horace, Odes, Book I, Ode 34, line 1).

Courtenay was described as follows by the genealogist Thomas Christopher Banks (1765–1854) in a letter to Lord Chancellor Brougham (1778-1868), who was an active force behind the decision of the House of Lords to revive the Earldom in his favour:
""One who ought to think himself happy that his titles and estates have not been forfeited, or himself paid the debt to the law like the Lord Hungerford of Heytesbury"" (beheaded in 1541 for offences against the Buggery Act 1533), ""one against whom a bill being found 'never ventured to put the question of guilt to a trial' but remained skulking abroad, afraid to venture on taking his seat in Parliament, his motto Ubi Lapsus, Quid Feci"" (i.e. ancient motto of the Courtenay family, ""Where did I slip, what have I done?"") ""putting  a question which its owner avoids to leave to a tribunal of his country to answer"".

Relationship with William Beckford 
As a youth, 'Kitty' Courtenay was sometimes named by contemporaries as the most beautiful boy in England. Courtenay was homosexual and became infamous for his affair with William Beckford; they had met when Courtenay was ten. Beckford, 8 years his senior was a wealthy art collector and sugar plantation owner.

In the autumn of 1784, a houseguest overheard an argument between the then 18-year-old Hon. (his title at that time) William Courtenay and Beckford over a note of Courtenay's. There is no record of what the note said, but the houseguest said that Beckford's response on reading it was that he entered Courtenay's room and ""horsewhipped him, which created a noise, and the door being opened, Courtenay was discovered in his shirt, and Beckford in some posture or other — Strange story.""  Beckford was subsequently hounded out of polite British society when his letters to Courtenay were intercepted by Courtenay's uncle, Lord Loughborough, who then publicised the affair in the newspapers.

Later life 
Courtenay was forced to live abroad, and lived in the United States where he owned a property on the Hudson River in New York. This was Claremont, the 100-acre estate of shipowner Michael Hogan at what is now Riverside Park. Courtenay took up residence in 1807, and from there watched the trial run of Robert Fulton's North River Steamboat. According to publisher Frank Leslie, Courtenay's land included the site of the Amiable Child Monument, the only single-person private grave on city-owned land in New York City. Around 1813, Courtenay moved to France, in Paris and in Draveil where he owned a castle. He died unmarried, and fathered no known children.

In 1831, as The 3rd Viscount Courtenay, he successfully petitioned to revive the title of Earl of Devon for the head of the Courtenay family, that title having been dormant since 1556, and so became the 9th Earl.

He died on 26 May 1835 at age 66 in Paris due to natural causes. He was loved by his tenants, who insisted that he be buried in stately fashion. He was buried on 12 June 1835 in Powderham.

491,11588289,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia%20E.%20Jenckes,Virginia E. Jenckes,"Virginia Ellis Jenckes (November 6, 1877 – January 9, 1975) served three terms as a U.S. Representative (March 4, 1933 – January 3, 1939) from Indiana's Sixth Congressional District. The Terre Haute, Indiana, native was the first woman from Indiana to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Alongside Kathryn O'Loughlin McCarthy, she was the second woman Representative from the Midwest and the first who was not succeeding a male relative. In 1937 she became the first American woman appointed as a U.S. delegate to the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Paris, France. The outspoken, independent-minded farmer from Vigo County was an advocate for women and became known for her support of flood control measures and repeal of Prohibition, as well as her opposition to communism. Jenckes's most significant accomplishment for her Indiana constituents was obtaining an $18 million appropriation for the Wabash River basin that eventually became law.

While Jenckes broadly supported New Deal initiatives in general and voted with the majority of the Democrats in the U.S. Congress, she did not always follow the Democratic majority. During her later years, Jenckes became especially concerned about thwarting what she believed to be communist propaganda and its perceived threats, despite the public ridicule she received. After retiring from Congress in 1939, Jenckes served as an American Red Cross volunteer for more than twenty years. During the Hungarian uprising of 1956, she gained national attention for her efforts to assist five Catholic priests in their escape to the United States from Hungarian prisons. In 1969 Jenckes returned to Indiana, where she spent the final years of her life.

Early life
Virginia Ellis Somes, the daughter of James Ellis Somes, a pharmacist, and Mary Oliver Somes, was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, on November 6, 1877. She attended public schools in Terre Haute, including Wiley High School, where she enrolled at the age of eleven and became the youngest student in the school’s history. She left high school early to complete her formal education by taking two years of courses at Coates College for Women.

In 1912, when Jencks was thirty-four, she married sixty-eight-year old Ray Greene Jenckes, a Terre Haute farmer and grain dealer. Together, they managed a  farm along the Wabash River in western Indiana. After her husband's death in 1921, Jenckes inherited the farm along with his grain business and assumed sole responsibility for their management. Their only child, a daughter named Virginia, was born in 1913 and died of tuberculosis on September 18, 1936, at the age of twenty-two.

Career

Early years
Jenckes, who had been involved in farming in Vigo County, Indiana, since her marriage in 1912, was well aware of the damage that frequent river flooding could do to farms. Jenckes later reported that her farm had flooded nine times in fourteen months during the 1920s. In 1926 Jenckes took a more active role in flood-control efforts after she and other local farmers organized the Wabash-Maumee Valley Improvement Association. Juncos served as the association's secretary until 1932.

In 1928 Jenckes was one of two women from the Terre Haute area who traveled to the Democratic National Convention in Houston, Texas, to join others in successfully lobbying for the inclusion of one of her association's flood-control plans as a plank in the Democratic Party's national platform. Jenckes also attained national prominence in 1928 as secretary of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress.

U.S. Congresswoman
In 1932 Jenckes became the first woman from Indiana to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She was elected as a new Deal Democrat to represent Indiana's Sixth Congressional District in the Seventy-third Congress and was re-elected to the two succeeding Congresses. Jenckes served in the U.S. House of Representatives from March 4, 1933, to January 3, 1939.

First term
Jenckes's first campaign for a seat in Congress began in 1932, the year after redistricting established Indiana's Sixth Congressional District, which included ten counties along the Wabash River in western Indiana. The district, a predominantly rural area of the state, extended north from Vigo County to Warren County. With her teenaged daughter as her chauffeur, the forty-four-year-old Jenckes campaigned extensively in the new district. It is estimated that she delivered more than two hundred speeches. During her campaign, Jenckes focused on repealing Prohibition, which she felt was contributing to the decline in grain prices, along with her previous record and efforts related to flood control.   
 
In order to win her first election, Jenckes had to defeat two incumbents. She beat the Democratic incumbent, Courtland C. Gillen of Greencastle, Indiana, in the party's primary in May 1932. In the general election she defeated Fred S. Purnell, an eight-term Republican congressman from Attica, Indiana, who had represented the northern counties in a district that was lost in the reorganization. Jenckes, who was one of four women in the United States who ran for a seat in Congress in 1932, easily won election in the Democrats' landslide election of 1932. Jenckes received 54 percent of the vote to Purnell's 46 percent and won in seven of the new congressional district's ten counties.

Jenckes quickly distinguished herself in Congress, despite her failure to secure the assignment she wanted on the Agricultural Committee or the Rivers and Harbors Committee. Instead of membership in these more prominent committees, Jenckes was assigned to the Mines and Mining, Civil Service, and District of Columbia committees. Jenckes retained her membership in the Civil Service and District of Columbia committees throughout her congressional career, but left the Mines and Mining committee after the conclusion of the 74th Congress.

An advocate of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies, including the Civilian Conservation Corps, banking regulations, economic supports for farmers, public housing, and Social security measures, Jenckes also favored the repeal of Prohibition and supported agricultural issues, especially flood control measures. During her first term in Congress, Jenckes took action on her campaign promise to repeal Prohibition by voting in support of the Cullen-Harrison Act, which allowed for the production, transportation, and sale of beer; it passed in March 1933. She also voted in favor of the Agricultural Adjustment Act and alternate legislation after the U.S. Supreme Court declared the Act was invalid. Through her work on the District of Columbia Committee, Jenckes sought to provide the city's voters ""with a greater voice in their government,"" to reduce the workload of its firefighters, and to monitor its schools.

In addition, Jenckes was as an advocate for U.S. veterans and American workers. She voted in favor of the Patman Greenback Bonus Bill, which extended a pay bonus to World War I veterans, and encouraged adoption of the Railroad Retirement Act. While Jenckes broadly supported New Deal initiatives, she did not always follow the Democratic majority and the Roosevelt administration's lead. In her first vote in Congress she expressed her independent mindedness when she voted against the Economy Act of 1933 because its cuts in government expenses would reduce veterans benefits, a move that Jenckes had promised her constituents she would not allow. Jenckes's most significant accomplishment for her constituents was to successfully obtain an $18 million appropriation for the Wabash River basin that eventually became law.

Second term
Jenckes won re-election to Congress in a close race in 1934, when she once again defeated Purnell, this time by a margin of 383 votes out of a total of 135,000 that were cast. During her second term in office, Jenckes took a more active role in speaking on so-called women's issues. Two themes characterized the remainder of her congressional career: Jenckes's ""self-identification as a champion of women’s interests"" and presenting herself as someone who could offer a feminine perspective on legislative issues. Endorsed by the National Woman's Party during her 1934 re-election campaign, Jenckes advocated for political equality for women, although she was not a radical feminist by later-defined standards. Jenckes emphasized ""traditional gender distinctions"" and supported policies that would benefit women as well as consumer and business interests. As one example, Jenckes urged Congress to reduce taxes on cosmetics, although she acknowledged that drug industry members had persuaded her to support the cause. Jenckes argued that cosmetics were ""necessities for many working women"" and the taxes were discriminatory.

Jenckes tended to favor programs that provided her constituency with economic supports and voted with the majority of the New Deal Democrats in general, even though she was ambivalent about some of these programs. For example, she voted in favor of the Social Security Act in 1935, but refused to accept Social Security benefits in her later years. Jenckes commented, ""I think when you give dole to people you take away their self respect.""

Third term
In 1936 Jenckes won a third term in the U.S. House, largely due to Roosevelt's landslide victory, by defeating Noble J. Johnson, her Republican challenger, only a few weeks after her daughter's death from tuberculosis. Jenckes became more conservative in her later years. In 1938 she petitioned Congress to ban the Works Progress Administration from competing in construction projects because she felt the federal program ""unfairly competed"" with the building trades. Jenckes was also a fervent supporter of J. Edgar Hoover and advocated congressional funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Jenckes was vocal in her opposition to communism and especially active in efforts to eliminate what she believed to be subversive activities in America. Jenckes's American patriotism and strong interest in national symbols also led her to introduce legislation that required the American flag to be flown atop federal buildings. Jenckes publicly stated that she believed the lack of flagpoles flying American flags atop public buildings in Washington, D.C., was due to the efforts of communist propagandists and called on other Americans, especially women, to join her anticommunist crusade. These as well as other related comments subjected Jenckes to public ridicule and also helped to make her ""a controversial figure"" throughout her years in Congress.

By the mid-1930s her intense patriotism and anticommunist views had overshadowed her advocacy of women's interests. In 1935 Jenckes supported an amendment to a Washington, D.C., appropriations bill that prohibited teaching, advocating, or mentioning communism in the city's public schools. The House repealed the amendment in 1937, but not before disagreements over the bill caused conflicts between Jenckes and other members of the District of Columbia Committee. Following re-election to her third and final term in Congress, Jenckes continued to create controversy about her anticommunist comments and ongoing distrust of Russia and Japan.  In 1937, for example, she advocated for the removal of cherry trees in Washington, D.C., that Japan had given to the United States at an earlier time as a gift of friendship. Jenckes suggested that they be replaced with American cherry trees because she thought that Japan's trees represented ""a symbol of traitorism and disloyalty"" and a means to ""open the way for their spies and propagandists.""

In 1937 Jenckes became the first American woman appointed as a U.S. delegate to the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Paris, France. The goal of the annual gathering, which she attended with three male U.S. senators, was to promote peace and cooperation in an effort to establish representative democracies. When Jenckes returned to the United States after the conference, she expressed her growing concern about Germany's expanding building programs and urged the U.S. government to demand repayment of loans made to European countries during World War I, a move that she thought would discourage rearmament. As an isolationist, Jenckes also supported a strong defense buildup, arguing that ""a strong defense was the best way to keep the United States out of war.""

Jenckes, a Democrat in a heavily Republican congressional district, was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1938 to the Seventy-sixth Congress. While her actions generally reflected her district's conservatism, Jenckes's work on behalf of her constituents did not to save her from defeat. Jenckes ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, but Noble J. Johnson, her Republican challenger, narrowly defeated her in the general election. Jenckes, who suggested her loss was the result of ballot tampering, was among the seventy Democrats in the U.S. House who were defeated for re-election that year.

Later years
After retiring from the U.S. Congress in 1939, Jenckes remained in Washington, D.C., where she was a volunteer for the American Red Cross for nearly two decades As a Red Cross volunteer, Jenckes worked in the first blood bank in the United States.

She also retained her anticommunist views. In 1956, when Jenckes was seventy-nine, she gained national attention for her efforts to assist five Catholic priests in their escape to the United States from prisons in Budapest, Hungary, during the Hungarian uprising. Jenckes also served as a liaison between Hungarian freedom fighters and the American government.

In 1969 Jenckes came home to Indiana. She lived in Indianapolis for two years before returning to Terre Haute  in 1971.

Death and legacy
After fracturing her pelvis, Jenckes was moved from her home in Terre Haute, Indiana, to a local nursing facility, where she died on January 9, 1975, at that age of ninety-seven. She was interred in Terre Haute's Highland Lawn Cemetery.

Jenckes, who represented ""populism"" and American ""patriotism,"" was among the ""more colorful"" politicians in Congress during the New Deal-era. An outspoken congressional leader whose conservatism increased over time, she also remained a staunch anticommunist, despite the public ridicule she received.  It has been said that Jenckes was ""a Cold War warrior even before, officially, there was a Cold War.""

Models

HP-15C
The HP-15C is a high-end scientific pocket calculator with a root-solver and numerical integration. A member of Hewlett-Packard Voyager series of programmable calculators, it was produced between 1982 and 1989. The calculator is able to handle complex numbers and matrix operations. Although out of production, its popularity has led to high prices on the used market. The HP-15C was a replacement for the HP-34C. The 15C used silicon on sapphire technology for its processor, resulting in very low power consumption.

HP 15c Limited Edition
After showing a prototype labelled ""HP 15c+"" at the HHC 2010, HP announced the HP 15c Limited Edition (NW250AA) on 1 September 2011. It is based on a flashable controller utilizing the same ARM7TDMI core already used in the 2008 revision of the 12C but in a different package, an Atmel AT91SAM7L128-AU running an emulator written by Cyrille de Brébisson to execute the old HP Nut code much faster than on the original hardware. The calculator was released alongside the HP 12c 30th Anniversary Edition. This model is powered by two CR2032 batteries, and can easily be differentiated from the original model by the ""Limited Edition"" script below the company logo as well as the black text on brushed metal back label, as opposed to the white text on black of the original.The power consumption of the processor is greater than that of the original HP-15C, as HP did not use the same technology in any of the future models.

Emulators
An official PC emulator for the 15C is available as freeware from Hewlett-Packard. Another version is commercially available for Android and iOS devices.

Clones
On 6 February 2012, SwissMicros (previously known as RPN-Calc) introduced a miniature clone named DM-15CC approximating the size of an ID-1 credit card (88 mm × 59 mm × 7 mm). It closely emulates the functionality of the original HP-15C by running the original ROM image in an emulator on an ARM Cortex-M0-based NXP LPC1114 processor. Newer DM15 models feature a better keyboard and more RAM (LPC1115). With a modified firmware (M80 and M1B), the additional memory allows for up to 129 or even 230 registers and up to 1603 or 896 programs steps. A DM15 Silver Edition in a titanium case is available as well in three color variants (metal, brown, blue). Deviating from the original, these calculators feature a dot-matrix display, switchable fonts and clock speeds, and, based on a Silicon Labs CP2102 converter chip, they come with a USB (Mini-B) serial interface to exchange data with a PC etc. for backup purposes and possibly to communicate with applications (like PC-based HP-15C emulators) or to update the firmware. In September 2015, SwissMicros introduced the DM15L, a version of the calculator about the same size as the original HP-15C. It still comes with a USB Mini-B connector. Powering via USB is not supported.

493,3722569,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Sheas%20Casino,O'Sheas Casino,"O'Sheas Casino is a casino located within The Linq, a hotel-casino and shopping promenade on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. O'Sheas originally opened in 1989 and operated in between the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino (later The Linq) and the Flamingo Las Vegas.

Owner Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced in 2011 that O'Sheas would close and be relocated to become part of the company's new shopping promenade nearby, known as The Linq. O'Sheas reopened in its new location on December 27, 2013. The revitalized O'Sheas has three bars - the main Dublin Up Bar, the Lucky Bar and the exterior-facing Blarney Bar. The casino includes beer pong tables, a stage, a dance floor and a pit with games including blackjack, roulette, and craps.

History

Hilton Nevada Corporation broke ground for the Irish-themed O'Sheas casino on September 7, 1988, with an opening planned for June 1, 1989. The project was built on the Las Vegas Strip, north of the company's Flamingo Hilton hotel-casino. The five-story building included three floors for parking space. The $22 million casino, with , would increase Hilton Nevada's casino space on the Strip by 30 percent. Its target clientele was middle-income tourists. R. Duell & Associates of Los Angeles was the designer, and Rissman & Rissman of Las Vegas was the architect. O'Sheas was designed to resemble an Irish pub, and would include hardwood floors, brass, Irish artifacts, and detailed wall designs. The casino would include 650 slot machines, 19 table games, keno, and a sportsbook, as well as a lounge, snack bar, and restaurant.

Construction was still underway in May 1989, and O'Sheas opened later that year. It was operated in conjunction with the Flamingo Hilton. Unlike most of the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, prior to this date O'Sheas was not part of a resort and had no hotel. O'Sheas was briefly featured in the 1997 movie Vegas Vacation, when character, Rusty Griswold, won a car through a slot machine sitting outside the casino.

On February 26, 2000, O'Sheas made the 2001 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records by having 220 patrons contribute to the largest crowd to participate in a nationwide toast. The Great Guinness Toast, as it is called, was tallied nationwide as having 320,470 participants. That easily broke the previous year's record of 197,846 participants. In 2006, Vince Neil, lead singer of the band Mötley Crüe, opened Vince Neil Ink, a tattoo parlor inside of O'Sheas. It featured a room called ""The Stage"" that was visible from the Las Vegas Strip, so visitors could watch the tattoo artists work from outside.

Relocation

Owner Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced in August 2011 that as part of The Linq shopping project nearby, O'Sheas would close and be relocated there. O'Sheas closed on April 30, 2012. On May 1, 2012, the 7 story parking structure for O'Sheas was imploded as part of The Linq project. O'Sheas reopened on December 27, 2013, located in The Linq shopping promenade. The new location contains . It is also connected to the casino floor at The Linq hotel-casino (formerly known as The Quad and the Imperial Palace).

Casino
O'Sheas targets, and typically attracts, younger crowds in their 20s and early 30s. The casino offered low minimums on table games, a poker room, and a World Series of Beer Pong branded beer pong area. Before being purchased by Caesars Entertainment (known then as Harrah's Entertainment), O'Sheas branded itself as having low minimums and liberal rules on table games, thus attempting to draw ""locals"" and savvy, low-minimum gamblers. After being acquired by Harrah's, O'Sheas generally offered the least advantageous table games in Nevada (i.e., bad for players), especially on Blackjack (where Blackjack only paid 6:5 on all games), and had branded itself as a ""party"" casino. The casino offers five beer pong tables in addition to the other games.

It is located along PA Route 982 in a heavily wooded area about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh at an elevation of 1,209 feet.

History
Kecksburg, ca. 1860, was laid out on 5 acres of land purchased by German merchant, farmer, and businessman Johann Martin Keck. In 1868 he was appointed postmaster of the town, being the first to occupy this position after the establishment of the office and held the role for 26 years.

UFO incident

On December 9, 1965 a large, brilliant fireball was seen by thousands in at least six states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan/Windsor, Ontario area, dropped metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, and caused sonic booms in Western Pennsylvania. The fireball landed in the woods just outside Kecksburg and was reportedly acorn-shaped. Some speculated that it was a UFO, however the United States government officially stated that it was just a meteor.

A large bell-shaped metallic object was made by Unsolved Mysteries for their story on the incident. After the story aired, the show donated the model to the town, and it was placed upon a three-legged wooden pedestal behind the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department. The model was taken indoors for a time, however it is now back outside on a new metal pedestal lit with spotlights.

To celebrate this local event, the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department holds an annual festival featuring presentations by UFO enthusiasts, vendor booths, and a community parade.

Hussein was the first Somali female to compete at the Olympics for her country when she competed in the 400 metres at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

She was not always supported in Somalia, where female athletes are uncommon and older men would criticise her for not staying at home. Hussein's father disliked the idea, as he was concerned that it would prevent her from finding a husband. Nevertheless, he subsequently allowed her to compete in Sydney for the sake of Somalia.

She finished her heat in 6th place and did not advance to the next round.
