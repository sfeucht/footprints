0,3,29157,"This document has been created to describe a concept that may be of use in a variety of fields.
It should be considered a general concept only and is subject to change.

This CPAN/POD version of the document,
first published in December 2004 at http://ali.as/devel/threatnetwork.html,
has been released to independantly timestamp and archive the concept and proposal in case of future patent-related issues by companies and to attempt to keep the core idea available to all.

On the Internet there exists an increasing number of different ways in which hosts are being misused or abused.
Likewise there is also an increasing number of ways in which these known-bad hosts are being identified.
Most of these occur in the process of a particular task,
such as checking an email message for spam status.

As these hosts are identified,
their identify is transmitted across to internet to members of threat networks.
The most common of these are the various email ""black lists"",
most of which use DNS or some other method to publish lists of known-bad ips or ip ranges.
Mail processing services submit requests to a DNS server storing these lists to determine if a particular host contacting them is a known spammer.

This draft specification describes a system which would be used to identify a specific category of these bad ips,
hosts that can be considered ""Active Threats"".
An Active Threat is a host that is currently engaged in anti-social,
damaging or criminal behaviour,
such as actively sending out spam or viruses.
This specification is NOT intended to deal with long-term offenders,
as they are addressed by a number of current systems.

If applied to long term offenders,
hosts would be registered as an Active Threat when they commence their anti-social behaviour,
and fall off any list during periods in which they are not conducting this behaviour.

The general intent is to deal with only those hosts that are actively engaged in damaging behaviour,
whether or not they are long term offenders or new offenders.
And to deal with the hosts as soon as possible,
ideally within a few seconds.

The ThreatNet concept is specifically intended to address active and transient threats.
If a Verified Threat is detected at time $t,
other members of the same Threat Network should start to recieve notification before time $t + 1 (within 1 second).
Full propagation to all members,
and any subsequent responses,
should be complete within by $t + 60 (within 1 minute).

Within a second of a host being detected conducting some anti-social behaviour,
the member should be able to confirm this behaviour and the host ip responsible for it,
and classify the host as a Verified Threat,
issuing a message into a Threat Network.
Notification to all members of the Threat Network and any other linked networks should occur as quickly as the Internet and Threat Network itself is able to spread this information.
Any members who wish to respond to the threat,
or are able to neutralise it,
should be able to act within a few seconds and certainly within a minute.

For the example of spam,
this would allow newly compromised hosts (""zombies"") acting as spam or virus agents that are not on current block lists to be dealt with and blocked before they are able to send significant amounts of spam.
This could also allow for compromised hosts on dynamic IPs to be blocked each time they move IPs without significantly damaging subsequent users of the IPs,
or needing to block the entire IP range.
This could also help to reduce the impact of new and fast-moving viruses,
as any newly infected computers appearing within properly managed ISPs could be disconnected and disabled before they are able to make a significant number of attempts to reproduce.

The implementation should be as flexible as possible and integrate with many other current systems,
or provide a way for developers to do this integration themselves.
Although the initial idea for this concept was as an anti-spam system,
it should not be considered solely"

IMMEDIATE RELEASE

"
4,23,4569,"In the art of article handling, various types of sorting devices have been provided heretofore. For example, switches have been provided for receiving articles from two or more input conveyors and for converging the articles, so that all articles are directed to a single output conveyor. Other switches have been designed to receive articles from a single input conveyor and to divert the articles so that the articles are selectively directed to one of two or more output conveyors. Still other sorting switches have operated to receive articles from a pair of input conveyors and to direct articles to a pair of corresponding output conveyors while selectively combining certain articles by directing them to a third output conveyor.
A number of devices have been developed which provide horizontal switching and sorting capabilities. Examples of such devices are the sorting switches disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,986,596 issued Oct. 19, 1976 to D. R. Hamilton, U.S. Pat. No. 3,987,888 issued Oct. 26, 1976 to I. E. Wickam and U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,206 issued Apr. 2, 1985 to J. W. Moore. The foregoing patents, all of which are assigned to the Assignee hereof, disclose and claim sorting switches that constitute important contributions to the art of sorting switches and article handling. These switches are, however, primarily adapted to handle articles comprising integral units, such as boxes or tightly wrapped packages and are not particularly suitable for handling or sorting articles comprising loosely bound bundles of papers, letters or magazines.
Currently, the handling and sorting of loosely bound bundles of papers, letters and magazines is largely done by hand. For example, mail is delivered to post offices in sacks of loosely bound bundles of papers, letters and magazines. The bundles are removed from the sacks and manually delivered to individual work stations where the individual pieces are sorted. This process is labor intensive and time consuming. Heretofore the process of delivering the bundles of mail to the individual work stations has not been mechanized or automated due to the lack of a switch adapted to and suitable for sorting and switching loosely bound bundles of papers, letters and magazines.
The present invention comprises a novel sorting switch which fulfills the foregoing and other requirements long associated with the prior art. In accordance with the broader aspects of the invention, a plurality of pallets are mounted for sequential movement around a closed course incorporating an upper article sorting portion and a lower return portion. The upper sorting portion of the closed course comprises diverging article conveying paths. The diverging article conveying paths are defined by guide members, and the pallets may be selectively switched to travel along the article conveying paths defined by the guide members. The lower portion of the closed course comprises a return section wherein return guide members align the pallets along a central path corresponding to the location of a switching mechanism.
In accordance with the more specific aspects of the invention, a closed course is defined by a pair of parallel roller chains. Each pallet is slideably supported on a pair of parallel tubular pallet support members extending between and connected to the roller chains. Each pallet comprises an upper article bearing surface and arcuate lower side surfaces. Each pair of tubular pallet supports is positioned relative to the adjacent pairs of tubular pallet supports such that the sides of each pallet are maintained in substantially abutting relationship with the sides of each adjacent pallet as the pallets move through the closed course. Consequently, there are no gaps between the pallets through which a loose paper, letter or magazine might fall. Moreover, the arcuate lower side portions of the pallets allow the pallets to remain in constant contact as the pallets travel from the upper article sorting portion of the switch to the lower return portion.
Knife edge conveyors are used to load and unload bundles of loosely fastened papers, letters and magazines to and from the article sorting switch. The knife edge conveyors enable the sorting switch to be loaded and unloaded at substantially the same vertical elevation as the upper article sorting portion of the switch. Thus, loose bundles of papers, letters and magazines may be conveyed and switched without being subjected to any substantial vertical drops. The absence of any substantial vertical drops minimizes the number of bundles that are broken or fall apart and consequently reduces the amount of labor required to collect and rebundle loose pieces.
The present invention provides numerous advantages over the sorting switches of the prior art. The present invention provides a means of mechanizing the handling of loosely fastened bundles of papers, letters and magazines which, prior to the present invention, required the expenditure of significant labor. Another advantage of the present invention is the capability of switching and sorting loosely fastened bundles of papers, letters and magazines without subjecting the bundles to any substantial vertical drops, thereby minimizing the number of bundles broken, and the number of loose pieces requiring rebundling. Still another advantage of the present invention is the handling of articles comprising loosely bundled papers, letters and magazines in an"

Thor: Hey Josh, Thor Wood founder of SnapShyft. How are ya?





During our last call-in show, Thor wowed us with his 30-second elevator pitch. He wanted to be on the show so bad that he called over 200 times until he got through. Now that’s a superfan. And when he was talking to me on the phone, he crushed it.

Now, let’s see how Thor does in front of five hungry VCs... in the pitch room.

From Gimlet this is The Pitch. I’m Josh Muccio.

Our investors today

I’m Charles Hudson

Charles started Precursor Ventures, where he’s invested $45 million in over 100 startups to date.

I’m Sarah Downey

Sarah’s a partner at Accomplice and they’ve invested $600 million in over 200 startups so far, one example, a company called Draftkings.

I’m Michael Hyatt

Michael built and sold two software companies for over $500 million dollars and now he invests for himself.

I’m Jillian Manus

Jillian is an angel investor and a partner at Structure Capital, where they’ve invested $98 million in high-profile startups like Uber.

I’m Phil Nadel

Phil companies that sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. Now he manages Forefront Venture Partners, one of the largest syndicates on AngelList.





The pitch for SnapShyft... is coming up. In just a moment.





Alright, here we go.

Sarah: Your name is Thor?

Jillian: Hi. Thor?

Thor: Yes, ma’am.

Sarah: You look like a Thor.

Jillian: I love that name!

Michael: Okay Thor the mighty.

Thor: My name’s Thor Wood. I’m the founder and CEO of SnapShyft. So a priest, a rabbi and a nun are sitting in a restaurant waiting for service. And in walks an elephant. They immediately recognize the danger of this situation and quickly vacate. This elephant in the room is the seemingly unsolvable problem that’s plaguing the food and beverage and hospitality industry. Staffing. You’ve got record high turnover, record low retention for workers and managers. It takes a month to replace an employee. And replacement costs alone are a staggering $150 billion each year in the US. Solutions that exist today have done nothing to mitigate the problems. So we created the SnapShyft labor marketplace. Our solution connects these understaffed food and beverage and hospitality operations with actual qualified industry pros on demand.

Think of Thor’s business is like a match-making service for restaurants and hotels who need to cover shifts... and workers looking to pick up extra work here and there.





Thor: We’re growing 45% month over month. And this is directly tied to our actual chart topping fulfilment rate that is three times the staffing industry average. And that's just part of the story. Because the workers love us. They're getting paid near instantly through us. Earning on average over 50% more than the national industry rate. Now I'm here today to raise $250,000 to help us move forward with additional pilots, and product enhancements for our target customer base. Thank you.

Jillian: Fantastic.

Michael: Okay, so I need a sous chef right away. Sell me on signing up.

Thor: So, it would take roughly 3 minutes for you to create an account, as a business. We validate you, that you exist with tax ID. And it’ll take you 30 seconds to post a shift. And immediately it’s broadcast in a radial pattern. So it’s going to hit the highest rated, that are the closest, that meet your requirements.

Michael: Smart. How fast can I get somebody? It’s 3 pm and I just heard my sous chef’s not gonna turn by 5. Can I, is that fast?

6,13,12046,"What if We Were to Act Like a Family?

It began with the whole family returning from a week at camp. We walk in the door, and there’s no air conditioning. Suspecting that our 17 year old furnace and air conditioning units had finally died, we started calling around for quotes.

Since we had a maintenance plan in place with a company, where you pay a monthly amount in exchange for free parts and labour, we decided to give them a call. They sent a technician, who determines that the problem is with our thermostat, and he promptly replaces it, because that is covered under our plan.

Expensive fix

He still can’t get the furnace to read from the thermostat, however, and thus determines that the wire connecting the two would need replacing. That would NOT be covered, and I would have to pay $129.99 + tax for a service visit to install that. I declined, as I was not excited about paying this company any more money than we already were.

My husband and I were already discussing replacing both units, and would likely be getting a new line anyway with their installation. So we proceeded with the quotes on an entire HVAC system, all the while sweating it out for the next couple days, both because of the heat, and because of the looming decision before us.

Costly replacement

As we were pondering over the difference between one system for a few thousand dollars, and another for a few thousand dollars more, something happened. At our mid-week chapel meeting, we shared our burden.

“You don’t have air conditioning?”

I explained the situation.

“You know [my husband] has wired the whole furnace/air conditioning system for this chapel, don’t you? At the very least, we could lend you some box fans for the next few days until you get something in place.”

Helpful saints

I humbly agreed, and that very evening, this wonderful saint, her husband and son appeared at our door, box fan in hand. My husband showed her husband the furnace, and half an hour later, the whole system was fully functioning.

Apparently when the technician had installed the new thermostat, he neglected to properly place the furnace door, and reset the safety switch. The $129.99 + tax thermostat wire was moot, and, at least in the meanwhile, we had some time until we really had to replace both units.

Place we go or a holy body

It all got me thinking. This is why God Himself designed His people to be in fellowship. What would it look like, if instead of turning to Google or the Yellow Pages, we were to turn to each other? What if we were to act like a family, instead of like disparate members, naively under the impression that we are slave to the worldly systems?

I believe that Satan puts incredible effort into making us believe that we are poorer than we really are. What better way to do this, than to make us all think that church is just a place we go to, instead of one holy body that we are responsible for.

Financial repercussions

What would our bank accounts look like, if we could just stop with these maintenance plans, these insurance policies, these yearly contracts? What would our mental, emotional, and even physical health look like without all this nail biting and hair pulling? What would our spiritual health look like, if we actually had the faith in God that we say we do, instead of this “just-in-case-God-fails” mentality that has driven us to legal systems, contracts, terms, conditions, and protection policies?

It’s as if, as Christians, we receive this inheritance deposit cheque from God at our salvation, but we walk around with it in our back pocket, holding off on cashing it in. Then when problems strike, we desperately run off to the cash money store, for a filthy expensive cash loan, thinking we are broke.

Wealth mentality

Jesus named the two greatest commandments as loving God, with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength, and loving your neighbour as yourself (Luke 10:27). I believe He said this for our sake, rather than for His. With complete trust in God, and complete fellowship with others in His body, we are far richer and healthier than we settle for, even while still on this earth.

We just need to cash in that cheque.

7,13,18762,"Probability bounds analysis

Probability bounds analysis (PBA) is a collection of methods of uncertainty propagation for making qualitative and quantitative calculations in the face of uncertainties of various kinds. It is used to project partial information about random variables and other quantities through mathematical expressions. For instance, it computes sure bounds on the distribution of a sum, product, or more complex function, given only sure bounds on the distributions of the inputs. Such bounds are called probability boxes, and constrain cumulative probability distributions (rather than densities or mass functions).

This bounding approach permits analysts to make calculations without requiring overly precise assumptions about parameter values, dependence among variables, or even distribution shape. Probability bounds analysis is essentially a combination of the methods of standard interval analysis and classical probability theory. Probability bounds analysis gives the same answer as interval analysis does when only range information is available. It also gives the same answers as Monte Carlo simulation does when information is abundant enough to precisely specify input distributions and their dependencies. Thus, it is a generalization of both interval analysis and probability theory.

The diverse methods comprising probability bounds analysis provide algorithms to evaluate mathematical expressions when there is uncertainty about the input values, their dependencies, or even the form of mathematical expression itself. The calculations yield results that are guaranteed to enclose all possible distributions of the output variable if the input p-boxes were also sure to enclose their respective distributions. In some cases, a calculated p-box will also be best-possible in the sense that
the bounds could be no tighter without excluding some of the possible
distributions.

P-boxes are usually merely bounds on possible distributions. The bounds often also enclose distributions that are not themselves possible. For instance, the set of probability distributions that could result from adding random values without the independence assumption from two (precise) distributions is generally a proper subset of all the distributions enclosed by the p-box computed for the sum. That is, there are distributions within the output p-box that could not arise under any dependence between the two input distributions. The output p-box will, however, always contain all distributions that are possible, so long as the input p-boxes were sure to enclose their respective underlying distributions. This property often suffices for use in risk analysis and other fields requiring calculations under uncertainty.

We study theoretically the effect of driving low-lying collective modes of the condensate by a weak asymmetric sinusoidally time-dependent field. We find that driving the radial breathing mode further destabilizes the condensate, while excitation of the quadrupolar surface mode causes the condensate to become more stable by imparting quasi-angular momentum to it. We show that a significantly larger number of atoms may occupy the condensate, which can then be sustained almost indefinitely. All effects are predicted to be clearly visible in experiments and efforts are under way for their experimental realization.'

13,5,9742,"Darrel Kent

Darrel Brock Kent (born October 1942) is a former Ottawa City Councillor. He served on council from 1980 to 1982 and from 1985 to 1991. He ran for mayor of Ottawa in 1982 and for Chair of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton in 1991.

Early career
Kent was involved in politics as a student at Carleton University, where he was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada Student Federation. 

Before entering politics, he was an elementary school history teacher at Alta Vista Public School. Kent first ran for city council in 1978 in Alta Vista Ward, but lost to incumbent alderman Don Kay. Kent had been a supporter of Kay's in the previous election, but became disillusioned citing an inattentiveness to projects in the ward and taking an ""irresponsible stand"" on the Quebec-Ontario construction border war.  He ran on a platform on providing services to the Eastway Gardens neighbourhood and turning the CN railway into a rapid transit route. At the time of the election, he was living on Southvale Cres. Kent ended up placing third with 21% of the vote, well behind Kay who won with 49% of the vote.

First term
Kent tried again to unseat Kay in the 1980 municipal election in the newly created Canterbury Ward. During the campaign, Kent cited traffic problems, a buffer around Sheffield Glen, improved day care services and making the NCC green space into an all-age recreation area, and for the NCC to clean up a swampy area behind Eastway Gardens. During the campaign, Kent was the target of election sign vandalism (which resulted in Kay being charged with public mischief) and ""hate literature"", where pamphlets were handed out with headlines re-arranged in ""obscene, sexual ways"" and that Kent should be murdered and is a sexual deviate. Kent would go on to defeat Kay, winning 57% of the vote to Kay's 43%.  

Following his election, Kent was appointed to the city's policy and priorities committee.  In his first term on council (which also gave him a seat on the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Council), Kent supported the re-election of Andrew S. Haydon for regional chair. Kent was a member of the so-called ""gang of nine"" on city council, a group of conservative-leaning aldermen who would often vote as a majority bloc to curb social spending, against the wishes of the city's left leaning mayor, Marion Dewar.

Mayoral run
On February 26, 1982, Kent announced that he would be challenging Dewar for mayor of the city in the 1982 mayoral election. He had been a vocal critic of Dewar, and played a role in cutting the city's budget for 1982.  The main issue of the campaign would be over Dewar's support of an $8.4 million arts centre at the Ottawa Teacher's College, which Kent opposed.  Kent would go on to lose to Dewar, winning 44% of"

16,29,22680,"With 2015, comes a new season of Minnesota Twins baseball. However, this season will be very different from the 2014 season, as the Twins will look to bring a World Series championship to the Twin Cities under newly-acquired manager Paul Molitor.

In the last 29 seasons for the Minnesota Twins, they have only hired two other managers besides Paul Molitor: Tom Kelly and Ron Gardenhire. Tom Kelly was the manager who brought the Twins their two World Series championships. He managed the Twins for 16 years, compiled a win/loss record of 1140-1244, managed the 1988 and 1992 All-Star games for the American League, and was the AL Manager of the Year in 1991. After the 2001 season, Ron Gardenhire replaced Tom Kelley as manager of the Twins. In Gardenhire’s 13 years as the Twin’s manager, he compiled a win/loss record of 1068-1039, took the Twins to the postseason five times, and won the 2010 AL Manager of the Year award. Despite all the success Gardenhire had as the Twins’ manager, the team felt it was time to move on, because the last four seasons have not been positive (388 losses). As one can see, the Twins don’t hire new managers often, and when they do they believe their new manager is the perfect choice to help the Twins contend.

(*) Now Paul Molitor has no former managerial experience, but that shouldn’t deem him to fail as the manager of the Twins. Last year, the Detroit Tigers hired Brad Ausmus, a former Major League Baseball catcher, who never managed a baseball team at any level, but got the job because he was a great man with a lot of knowledge about the game of baseball. In his first season as the manager of the Tigers, Aumus and the Tigers won the AL Central with a 90-72 record, but were swept in the ALDS by the Baltimore Orioles. Like Ausmus, Molitor was a Major League Baseball player who played designated hitter, third base, and second base in 21 seasons between the Milwaukee Brewers, the Toronto Blue Jays, and the Minnesota Twins. The Hall-of-Famer has a career line of.306/.369/.448/.817 with 234 HR and 1307 RBI in 2,683 games. So, Molitor knows how to play the game extraordinarily well at the Major League level, and hopefully he has the ability to teach his team what it takes in order to become a dominant club in Major League Baseball.

Since 2010, the Twins have not had a winning season. In 2011 they lost 99 games, in 2012 they lost 96 games, in 2013 they lost 96 games, and in 2014 they lost 92 games. If the Twins are going to try to reverse their current trend of losing around, it may be hard, but it can be achieved.

The AL Central may have gotten stronger this year with the White Sox acquiring a lot of players, the Indians trading for Brandon Moss, the Royals upgrading their team with names like Alex Rios and Edison Volquez, and the Tigers boosting their team with names like Yoenis Cespedes, Alfredo Simon, and Tom Gorzelanny, but the Twins still aren’t out of contention.

In response to the other actions performed by their rivals in the AL Central, the Twins have also made moves of their own in order to stay competitive. Adding Torii Hunter on a one-year, $10.5 million deal, gives the Twins a player who can play right field and can create runs (113 wRC+ as stated by FanGraphs). Drafting J.R. Graham in the Rule 5 Draft gave the Twins a pitcher, who was a former top-100 prospect, and if he stays on the Major League roster during the course of the season, he could possibly become essential to the team’s rotation or bullpen. The Acquisition of Ervin Santana on a four-year, $55million deal, gives the team a viable starter that could help improve the team’s rotation, which was dead last in the American League last season with a team 4.57 ERA and 1.44 WHIP. Extending Phil Hughes on a three-year, $42 million extension, gives the Twins an extra year of service for a pitcher that performed really well for them in 2014. In 2014, Hughes went 16-10 with a 3.52 ERA (2.65 FIP) with an outstanding K/BB ratio of 182/16 in 202.2 innings. The signing of Brock Peterson on a minor-league deal gives the Twins another name who could be"

What is ion foot spa machine-ARG Dual foot spa machine with Belt (ARG722B) is a fast,effective and non-invasive way of stimulating and balancing the bio-energetic. It is strongly recommended that you follow a regular and continuous Detox stimulation and detoxification programme.The Dual foot spa machine ionizes the water in the footbath by the interaction between the arrays, the water and the salt. This results in an electromagnetic field that stimulates your body bio-energetically via the feet or hands. The result is that your body can detox safely and at its own pace, by mobilizing residues and wastes stored within the body. This detoxification happens mainly after treatment and is likely to take place via the organs of detoxification i.e. the kidneys, liver and skin.

Why do We need to detox?

1. Increase the static energy of the body.
2. Activate the cells and adjust the vegetative nerve.
3. Boost the metabolism and enhance the immunity.
4. Purify the blood and prevent the arteriosclerosis.
5. Stimulate the Digestive system.
6. Reduce the burden on the liver.
7. Boost the intestines and stomach function.
8. Get rid of aches and increase wound healing.
9. Physical therapy massage.

The detox foot spa prohibitions

Please don’t use the detox foot spa if the below.
1) pacemaker or other magnetic devices.
3) medicine for heart disease

The detox foot spa course suggestion:

1) Children over 3 should only use with adult supervision,aprox 30 mins or less
2) Adults One daily treatment for 14 days, and repeat after 3 weeks.

Colors and Objects in the Water:

Many colors and objects appear in the water during an ionic cleanse session.
For mostly people, the water color will be changed into brown or darken except few people who have numerous toxins from the body.

It is important to understand that the water will change color even if the unit is operating without feet in the water.

In fact, the darken color (including the “rust” smell) is not all your toxins from your body. It’s the result of the reaction between all of the variables in the water (the toxins, particles in the water, the salt added to the water) and the metals in the array and the acidity or alkalinity of the person being bathed.

The toxins in our bodies will look the same as the toxins predominant in a specific area; however, there will be more toxic particles in the water with feet in it. You will also find that water-based toxins will not stick to the side of the bucket and array and is easily rinsed off, whereas substances"

============

Microbiota acquisition is a dynamic and progressive process, beginning from birth and gaining stability into the toddler stage of development^[@CR1],[@CR2]^. The neonate gut is colonized through vertical transmission of maternal microbes, which can be influenced by factors including length of gestation^[@CR3]^, mode of delivery (vaginal vs caesarean)^[@CR4]^, and whether the infant is breast fed or formula fed^[@CR5],[@CR6]^. The composition and diversity of the microbiota, particularly that of the intestine, is essential to the maintenance of host homeostasis. The gut microbiota demonstrates considerable influence on the development of host immunity^[@CR7]^, and as such, perturbations of the microbiota composition can prove deleterious to the host. Interestingly, the intestinal microbiota of premature infants display high abundance of *Enterobactericiae*, primarily *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*^[@CR8]--[@CR10]^.

Although microbiota composition can be dynamic within the first few years of life, ""long-term colonizers"" can stably occupy the intestinal tract. Their persistence has been associated with the expression of several virulence genes which may have deleterious consequence on the host. For example, *E*. *coli* belonging to the B2 phylogenetic group^[@CR11]^, carry the pathogenic polyketide synthase (*pks*) island, a virulence gene cluster responsible for the production of colibactin, a genotoxin capable of inducing DNA damage^[@CR12]^. The presence of the *pks* was strongly associated with the majority of long term colonizing *E*. *coli* strains identified in a longitudinal study involving infants^[@CR13]^. Interestingly, we previously demonstrated a murine adherent-invasive *E coli* (NC101), containing the *pks*, contributes to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC)^[@CR14]^. Subsequent studies showed that *pks* + *E*.*coli* are present in biofilm of intestinal mucosal tissues from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients and participate, along with enterotoxic *Bacteroides fragilis* in carcinogenesis in pre-clinical models^[@CR15]^. Other bacteria have also been discovered to carry the *pks* gene, including *Klebsiella pneumoniae*^[@CR12],[@CR16]--[@CR18]^, and exhibit cytotoxic capabilities *in vitro*^[@CR16],[@CR19]^.

    We propose how to quantify high-frequency market sentiment using high-frequency news from [NASDAQ news platform](http://www.NASDAQ.com/news) and support vector machine classifiers. News arrive at markets randomly and the resulting news sentiment behaves like a stochastic process. To characterize the joint evolution of sentiment, price, and volatility, we introduce a unified continuous-time sentiment-driven stochastic volatility model. We provide closed-form formulas for moments of the volatility and news sentiment processes and study the news impact. Further, we implement a simulation-based method to calibrate the parameters. Empirically, we document that news sentiment raises the threshold of volatility reversion, sustaining high market volatility.\

    **Sentiment-Driven Stochastic Volatility Model:\
    A High-Frequency Textual Tool for Economists**[^4]

Introduction
============

Sentiment measures based on textual analysis of media contents such as news articles, message boards, or even search volumes have gained popularity among researchers [@tet:07; @antweiler2004all]. Whereas previous research considers low-frequency data, witnessing tremendous growth in the number of released news having shorter distances between the releases, it is tempting to ask a question if this almost “continuous” news feed can be used to measure a “continuous” changes in market sentiment. Even more interesting would then be to learn if such high-frequency news sentiment contains financially relevant information concerning stock price and volatility. To understand the evolution and dynamics of high-frequency news sentiment, we propose to use machine learning techniques to quantify sentiment from high-frequency news from the NASDAQ news platform, and we introduce a new high-frequency text-based sentiment measures to economists. Second, we propose to model the sentiment measures as a stochastic process and document how news sentiment influences volatility and price dynamics empirically by calibrating a sentiment-driven stochastic volatility model on data. Third, we provide explicit analytical moments that allow studying the non-trivial correlation of sentiment and volatility theoretically.

Sentiment and its role in financial markets have been attracting the attention of researchers from the early days. [@keynes1936general] argued that markets can fluctuate wildly due to investors’"

Archelon is an extinct marine turtle from the Late Cretaceous, and is the largest turtle ever to have been documented, with the biggest specimen measuring  from head to tail,  from flipper to flipper, and  in weight. It is known only from the Dakota Pierre Shale and has one species, A. ischyros. In the past, the genus also contained A. marshii and A. copei, though these have been reassigned to Protostega and Microstega, respectively. The genus was named in 1895 by American paleontologist George Reber Wieland based on a skeleton from South Dakota, who placed it into the extinct family Protostegidae. The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) was once thought to be its closest living relative, but now, Protostegidae is thought to be a completely separate lineage from any living sea turtle.

Archelon had a leathery carapace instead of the hard shell seen in sea turtles. The carapace may have featured a row of small ridges each peaking at  in height. It had an especially hooked beak and it jaws were adept at crushing, so its diet probably consisted of hard-shelled crustaceans and mollusks while slowly moving over the seafloor. However, its beak may have been adapted for shearing flesh, and Archelon was likely able to produce powerful strokes necessary for open-ocean travel. It inhabited the northern Western Interior Seaway, a mild to cool area dominated by plesiosaurs, hesperornithiform seabirds, and mosasaurs. It may have gone extinct due to the shrinking of the seaway, increased egg and hatchling predation, and cooling climate.

Research history

The holotype specimen, YPM 3000, was collected from the Late Campanian-age Pierre Shale of South Dakota along the Cheyenne River in Custer County by American paleontologist George Reber Wieland in 1895, and described by him the following year based on a mostly complete skeleton excluding the skull. He named it Archelon ischyros, genus name from the Ancient Greek ἀρχη- arkhe- ""first/early,"" χελώνη chelone """

Multiple gluon radiation is allowed during each time step, where the number $n$ of radiated gluons is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with the mean taken as $\langle N^a_g \rangle$. Thus, the probability for the inelastic scattering process is $P^a_\mathrm{inel}=1-e^{-\langle N^a_g \rangle}$. Note for $g\rightarrow gg$ process, $\langle N^g_g\rangle/2$ is taken as the mean for the Poisson distribution to avoid double counting.

It has come to my attention that mechanical engineers (such as myself) are a completely outnumbered minority when it comes to robotics... And my experience shows that the majority robot builder is by trade a programmer...

So I am curious about what everyones specialty is. Please vote!

If you have not been officially trained in any of the fields (at a university), just vote for the one you think you are best at. If you are equal in two different areas, choose the one that you want to be best at.

If you are a specialist in an outside field that still relates to robotics, such as psychology (for AI) or biology (for biomimetics), choose Other and let us know!

Just a hobbyist, no university degree (yet). However I work as a computer technician and I have an assistant computer programming (intensive) course diploma. In highschool I did electronics as a hobby and I was a lathe machine operator after finishing high school. So I have some knowledge from all the fields, but not a university diploma.

Hi i am doing some Serious Robotics stuff for last 9 years when i was in my 8 grade. Since then i had develop skills in mechanical, electronics and programing.But i am more inclined to mechanicals but i am doing my undergraduate engineering in electronics

Hello, I just recently got into robotics. I am studying to be a computer engineer(3rd year) so I know about both circuit design and programming. I also have more friends than I can count that are mechanical engineers. One of them even taught me how to use SolidWorks when I made my first robot.

I'm a mechanical Engineer, doing a PhD in applied dynamics and control systems (how stuff moves and making it move how you want). I think starting off in robotics you don't need too much of these skills though. As the 50 dollar robot shows, two servos and some cardboard wheels and you're moving about. I think understanding electronics is a harder first step in robotics for someone starting to learn from scratch, because I think people have a more intuitive feel for mechanics (force, mass, velocity...etc) than they do voltage, inductance, capacitance.

All engineering is just problem solving, whether circuit trouble, bugs in your code, mechanical failure, you use the same basic skills to try and figure out what's going wrong its just the tools that are different (oscilloscope, debugger, HAMMER )

Using Instagram as a Tool to Level Up

I recently came across this great article in Dance Magazine on the way social media, particularly Instagram, is influencing our art, addressing the wide-reaching impact the current trends could have on the ballet world. These trends don't just affect the insiders in the ballet scene (a.k.a. you & me - the ones struggling to ""make it"" in such a cutthroat field while we are bombarded with snapshots of extreme flexibility and tricks to compete with) but also the way ballet is seen and appreciated by our audience (the ones who aren't educated in the nuances of our technique and are being taught to expect these extreme feats as a necessary part of ballet). What will happen when they go see a classical performance devoid of all the overstretched positions and wow-worthy jumps? Will they be bored and expect more? Are all the flashy tricks numbing us to what is really beautiful about our elite art?

Even though Instagram has been around for almost 10 years, it is still relatively new to us all. We are still figuring out how to use it. I know how destructive it can be when I get caught in the comparison game, yet I still find myself scrolling aimlessly through dozens of pictures that make me feel bad about myself and only serve to feed the demons in my head. The author of the article describes it as ""dance erotica,"" which is a fairly accurate description for how we can often get sucked into Instagram. We attempt to momentarily escape from the real world as we fetishize about the feet we want, or the extensions we desire, or the ability to pull off 11 pirouettes. You know that sickening feeling you get when you've just spent 45 minutes drooling over wow-worthy photos of perfect ballerinas that you feel so depressed and worthless about yourself that you just want to curl up in a ball and hide in a dark room forever?

Yeah, that's the kind of unhealthy impact we want to avoid with Instagram.

I won't go too deep into the dark side of Instagram since this article does a great job of covering that. However, I do want to shed a little light on the perks and how to ensure your personal Instagram experience is beneficial to your growth both as a dancer and a human being. There's no denying that Instagram is an important part of marketing yourself as a dancer as well as a platform for your artistry.

In addition, programming and erasing a flash memory involves higher than normal voltages as compared to performing read operations. The use of these higher-than-normal voltages can cause problems when trying to implement the capability to simultaneously read while programming/erasing. Such problems include difficulties in distributing the high voltages required for the program and erase operations along with normal voltage for read operations and handling increased noise induced on the read sense outputs by the use of high voltages elsewhere within the device. Further, depending on the implementation, redundant logic may also be employed which introduces further complexities.
A new type of flash memory has recently been developed that is capable of providing simultaneous read and write operations. In this type of flash memory, the memory device is divided into two or more banks. Each bank includes a number of sectors and each sector includes a set of memory cells. Each bank has a respective decoder circuit that selectively receives an address from an input address buffer or from an internal address sequencer controlled by an internal state machine. The output data for each bank can be communicated to a read-sense amplifier or a verify-sense amplifier. The read-sense amplifier connects to the output buffer while the verify-sense amplifier connects to the state machine. When one bank receives a write command (program or erase), the internal state machine takes control and starts the program or erase operation. While one bank is busy with the program or erase operation, the other bank can be accessed for reading data.
For a detailed discussion of sliding bank architecture, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,867,430 entitled xe2x80x9cBANK ARCHITECTURE FOR A NON-VOLATILE MEMORY ENABLING SIMULTANEOUS READING AND WRITINGxe2x80x9d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,998 entitled xe2x80x9cNON-VOLATILE MEMORY ARRAY THAT ENABLES SIMULTANEOUS READ AND WRITE OPERATIONS,xe2x80x9d which are herein incorporated by reference.
As known to those skilled in the art, flash memory may be used to store various types of information. In general, the information can be divided into two categories, code and data. Code corresponds to program code that is used to execute various operations that the flash memory is capable of performing. Data generally corresponds to fields of data that changes more frequently than code. Because code rarely, if ever, changes in lifetime of some devices, it is desirable to have the ability to write-protect sectors that store code, while leaving some sectors unprotected. Providing a write-protect function allows manufacturers to ensure that data does not mistakenly get written into a"

By the end of her first day among fellow
freak-teens, Sophie has quite a scorecard: three powerful enemies who look like
supermodels, a futile crush on a gorgeous warlock, a creepy tagalong ghost, and
a new roommate who happens to be the most hated person and only vampire student
on campus. Worse, Sophie soon learns that a mysterious predator has been
attacking students, and her only friend is the number-one suspect.

As a series of blood-curdling mysteries starts
to converge, Sophie prepares for the biggest threat of all: an ancient secret
society determined to destroy all Prodigium, especially her.

My
Thoughts:

I was really looking forward to reading this one, so
many people love this series and I had wanted to read this for such a long
time. I am sorry to say that while I didn't hate this book, it didn't live up
to my expectations.

Sophie Mercer is a witch, sentenced by the council
to go to school at Hex Hall with her fellow punished Prodigium. She doesn't know much about being a witch. Her
mother is human and her father is a warlock, who she has never met. Going to a
reform school full of witches, werewolves, and faeries is something new for
Sophie and she doesn't know what to expect.

I don't know what it was about this book that I just
didn't connect completely with, because there wasn't anything that I hated
about it but, there also wasn't anything that I loved. One reason I think I
didn't fall in love with this book was written for more middle grade at least
in my opinion. Normally this doesn't
bother me but, for some reason it did. But, some of the positives of this one
is that it made me smile, it was a great story for a younger middle grade
reader. I also enjoyed her friendship with her roommate Jenna, a vampire.

Overall, this book was a fun read but, maybe just too
young for me. Sophie was a strong protagonist and she was ready for anything,
definitely the main character type that I love. I recommend this book for
younger readers and it is definitely great for a first time paranormal reader.
I know I have many readers out there who love these books so, tell me your
thoughts and opinions.

Recently banished, unfairly,
by the school’s popular crowd, former “it girl,” Miranda Prospero, finds
herself in a brave new world: holding dominion amongst a rag-tag crew of geeks
and misfits where she works at the Hot-Dog Kabob in the food court of her local
mall. When the worst winter storm of the season causes mall workers and
last-minute shoppers to be snowed-in for the night, Miranda seizes the
opportunity to get revenge against the catty clique behind her social exile.
With help from her delightfully dweeby coworker, Ariel, and a sullen loner
named Caleb who works at the mall’s nearby gaming and magic shop, Miranda uses
charm and trickery to set things to right during this spirited take on
Shakespeare’s The Tempest.

My Thoughts:

I received this book from the publisher in
exchange for review.

I really enjoyed this book,
it was short and sweet yet it was packed with so much plot that kept me
entertained throughout the entire thing. I have to be honest but, I haven't
read The Tempest since high school and I really didn't pay much attention to
the plot, wish I did now though. Our main character is named Miranda Prospero,
which is right out of Shakespeare's play.

John Calvin Fiser (May 4, 1838 – June 4, 14, or 15, 1876) was an American merchant and soldier. He served as an officer in the Confederate Army  during the American Civil War, fighting in both the Eastern as well as the Western theaters. Fiser was seriously wounded five times in the conflict, losing an arm in 1863's Battle of Fort Sanders, and he was appointed a general officer late in the war; however, the appointment was never confirmed by the Confederate Senate.  Afterward he returned to his business interests and was active in Confederate veterans organizations.

Early life and career
John Fiser was born in 1838 in the city of Dyersburg located in Dyer County, Tennessee. His father was Matthew Day Fiser (died 1852) and his mother's identity (died 1849) is not known. In 1848 Fiser's family moved to Batesville in Panola County, Mississippi. After his father died Fiser was raised by his uncle, John B. Fiser, a politician and merchant also living in Panola County. In 1853 he began working in Lafayette County, clerking in a country store near the shore of the Tallahatchie River. In 1855 Fiser moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and found work"

However, in the case of intending to fabricate an element with a track width of less than 100 nm, even if the narrow mask pattern can be formed by advanced exposure technology, it becomes difficult to control the under-cut, which poses a problem in that the lift-off cannot be performed.
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2004-342154 (“Patent Document 2”) describes the fact that the problem with the difficulty of lift-off in which a magnetic domain control layer is removed from above a magnetoresistive device can be prevented by the following. A mask is used to pattern the magnetoresistive element and the magnetic domain control layer is laminated on the mask remaining left. Thereafter, the magnetic domain control layer formed on the mask and a mask surface layer are removed by a planarizing process using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to expose the mask. The mask thus exposed is removed. Further, Patent Document 2 describes the fact that the magnetic head can be fabricated in which an upper electrode formed after the removal of a mask is joined to a magnetoresistive effect film through a projecting portion extending therefrom toward the magnetoresistive device.
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2004-186673 (“Patent Document 3”) describes a method of removing a resist pattern by using CMP during lift-off process. According to this method, a first CMP stopper is disposed on the magnetoresistive effect film and a second CMP stopper is disposed on a lead layer including a magnetic bias layer and a conductive layer disposed on both sides of the magnetoresistive effect film. The resist pattern and an unnecessary film on the resist pattern are removed by CMP. In this way, a read element having a narrow track-width can be fabricated.
In the CPP-type magnetoresistive effect head (CPP-GMR head, TMR head), a magnetic domain control layer is disposed on both sides of a sensor junction via an insulating film, so that a distance between a free layer and a magnetic domain control layer is increased. Therefore, a magnetic domain control layer is needed that is thicker than that of the CIP structure which allows detection current to flow parallel to the surface of the magnetoresistive effect film. To meet the necessity, it is necessary to allow a magnetic domain control layer to protrude upward from the upper surface of the magnetoresistive effect film.
The magnetic head described in Patent Document 2 is provided with an upper insulation film between a magnetic domain control layer and an upper magnetic shield so that the film thickness of the magnetic domain control layer cannot be increased.
As described in Patent Document 3, the lift-off using CMP can remove the unnecessary resist of the device track portion and a magnetic domain control layer by the planarizing effect of CMP. However, a problem simultaneously arises in that the magnetic domain control layer not protected by the CMP stopper film is scraped beyond necessity. For example, as shown in FIG. 12, a first CMP stopper film 15 is formed on top of the magnetoresistive effect film 11 and patterning is performed using a resist pattern 18. Then, a refill insulation film 12 and a magnetic domain control layer 13 are laminated on both sides of the magnetoresistive effect film 11 and a resist pattern 18 and on top of the resist pattern 18. A second CMP stopper film 16 is formed on top of the magnetic domain control layer 13 thus laminated."
56,15,214,"The Los Angeles Chargers traveled to MetLife Stadium for the second time this year and came away with their second win, defeating the New York Jets 14-7.

QB Bryce Petty went 15-of-28 for 119 yards with an interception and no touchdowns. RB Bilal Powell had an excellent day, aided by three big plays, including a long 57-yard touchdown run. He ended the game with 145 rushing yards.

QB Philip Rivers was 22-of-40 for 290 yards and a touchdown to his longtime teammate TE Antonio Gates. Gates led the Chargers in receiving as well, catching six passes for 81 yards on the day. RB Melvin Gordon had 81 yards on 19 carries and chipped in another 47 yards receiving.

With that, we give you our PFF-exclusive takeaways from the contest for each team.

Top 5 Grades:

LB Korey Toomer, 90.6 overall grade

TE Antonio Gates, 88.6 overall grade

S Jahleel Addae, 87.7 overall grade

RB Melvin Gordon, 84.5 overall grade

S Adrian Phillips, 82.4 overall grade

Performances of Note:

RB Melvin Gordon, 84.5 overall grade

Gordon surpassed the 1,000 yard mark for the first time in his career and did so by breaking five tackles in a game for the second straight week. Much like Powell on the opposite sideline, help wasn't always plentiful for Gordon from his run blockers but he made the most of what he got, whether that was breaking tackles to maximize solid blocking or breaking tackles behind the line to turn losses into no gain or short gains. This was Gordon's eighth career game forcing five or missed tackles on the ground.

TE Antonio Gates, 88.6 overall grade

Gates pulled in all six passes thrown his way against the Jets, the first time he's caught every target in a game this season when he's been targeted more than twice. Gates was busy on the left side of the field, picking up three of his catches outside the left numbers when 10 or more yards down the field. His longest gain of 27-yards was when he got open on a tight end-throwback off of play action. He sneaked through the second level, getting lost as a presumed blocker before breaking free in the secondary to set the Chargers up in the red zone on their first touchdown drive.

58,16,21233," effect may require them either to develop different dispositions from the h-traits or to rewire their networks of trust so that their h-traits function more appropriately. Our claim is that the evaluative character of h-traits - whether they should be considered epistemically good or not - depends on the structure of the social networks in which agents find themselves. This idea could be given a strong interpretation, according to which epistemic virtues are partly constituted by the material, social, and political environment, or a weaker interpretation, according to which epistemic virtues are essentially embedded in material, social, and political environments. Alfano & Skorburg (2017) call these positions the extended and embedded character hypotheses, respectively. We contend that unless one's social network is structured in a way that many real social networks are ​not ​(Sullivan et al. forthcoming; Alfano et al. 2018), one's h-traits may fail to qualify as virtues. For instance, recent simulations suggest that even ideally rational Bayesian agents are guaranteed to polarize in their opinions unless the patterns of epistemic trust and distrust that connect them are structured in the right way (Pallavicini et al. forthcoming). These structures in the ​topology ​of social networks can be analyzed and sometimes ameliorated at both the local and global level (Alfano 2016). The tension between myside and ourside bias is a problem because the h-traits are -- ideally -- supposed to forestall both individualistic manifestations of vanity, undue pride, and so on and​ groupish manifestations of these vices such as ""racism, sexism, ethnic hatred, religious hatred, and homophobia"" (Spezio et al. 2018; see also Christen, Alfano, & Robinson 2017; Christen, Robinson, & Alfano 2014). We thus need to reconsider how people can best ensure that h-traits are expressed in appropriate attitudes not only towards towards members of their own communities (a topic that has been addressed in the literature) but also towards those who belong to other communities (a topic that has been largely neglected). Here is the plan for this paper: in section 1, we argue that h-traits plausibly correct or ameliorate myside bias. Next, in section 2 we argue that, given how people's social networks are typically structured, h-traits can be expected to lead to ourside bias. Finally, in section 3 we explore three approaches to resolving the dilemma we've diagnosed. The first involves restructuring one's social network so that ourside bias is not exacerbated by h-traits. The second involves emulating the Socratic figure of the gadfly. And the third involves the Nietzschean virtue of solitude. 4 1 H-traits and myside bias Myside bias is a manifestation of a broader phenomenon referred to as confirmation bias (McKenzie 2004). It is tempered in social contexts when the group is decentralized and contains a diversity of opinions (Surowiecki 2004; see also Masterton et al. 2016, 2017, 2018 and Zollman 2012). In such groups, each individual's myside bias is harnessed in a way that leads to a better overall outcome. In particular, Mercier & Sperber (2019) argue that that the people who are sympathetic to ​p​ will tend to find and emphasize all the relevant evidence and arguments in favor of ​p​, while those who are unsympathetic to ​p​ will tend to find and emphasize all the relevant evidence and arguments against ​p​. Together, then, they manage to take into account all the evidence and arguments​ both​ in favor of and against ​p​. Such a division of cognitive labor seems to be essential to many human cognitive successes. Social scientists have institutionalized it in the form of adversarial collaborations (Mellers et al. 2001). If one is good enough at role-playing, one can even form an adversarial collaboration with oneself (Alfano 2018). The h-traits plausibly assist in these processes. For example, Baron (2008) argues that actively open-minded thinking opposes myside bias."

60,25,1049,"1. Describe your business in one sentenceHelping local businesses and residents make the most of their town with a modern, interactive and user-friendly content hub, where anyone and everyone can enjoy and contribute towards the best the town has to offer.2. How did you come up with the idea for your business?

After being partner at SwindonWeb for nine years I saw a need for an upgraded proposition in towns across the country. The market for all-encompassing town and city guides is still remarkably untapped. I think this is because many are simply focussing on 'What’s On'. Although it's a lot of hard work to cover everything from business, health and fitness, shopping, recruitment and events while doing a good job, to be really useful it needs to cover everything to suit individual tastes.

The explosion of social media has also emphasised that users want to engage with local business and the community so they can focus on local hot topics. We have developed functionality so locals can really get involved with the site rather than just be presented with standard 'local newspaper' style content.

3. What have been your key challenges and how have you overcome them?

Too many ideas with limited time, resources and budget! I have overcome these by setting small achievable targets and taking it one step at a time.

I've also found it hard to let go and delegate. If I had had the time I would have populated the entire website content myself. Fortunately, I realised very early on that my time was better spent out there selling and meeting businesses rather than sat behind a desk adding to the business directory! I have built a team of fantastic and trustworthy freelancers which means I can focus on growing the business (and it makes it easier to sleep at night!). There is obviously an ultimate goal but it would be difficult and demotivating to get there without breaking it down in to bite size chunks. Having a small but fantastic team has also been a key factor in overcoming challenges.

Another challenge which I have to be constantly mindful of is that I know Swindon and the local businesses very well so launching in Swindon meant the business has grown very quickly. It's a constant challenge to keep reminding myself that we are rolling this out across the UK and the needs in each town will differ dramatically. Luckily my investor is from outside of Swindon and is behind the scenes making sure that we 'box' Total Swindon up so that the model can be easily replicated in other areas, no matter how dissimilar they are to Swindon.4. How have you funded your start-up?

Investment from my business partner Will Seward. We have also been fortunate enough to have a customer base before we went live from clients paying for social media management and training which has helped fund staffing and designs costs. Fortunately, you can start an online company with very little costs and over heads.5. How do you market your business?

Central to all our marketing is social media and this has played a massive role in building the hype of Total Guide to Swindon. We had over 600 registrants months before the site went live - just from social media. Regular email marketing is a core part of our business. From April, we will also be covering traditional methods with four pages in a local monthly magazine which will be a taster of what's on the site, as well as billboard advertising and sponsoring local roundabouts.

Because of the nature of the business my clients are willing to give us free posters/billboard sites on their premises and we have contra-deals with other local media including local magazines and radio stations.6. What are your plans for the future?

We plan to roll out 'Total Guide To...' to five other towns and cities by the end of this year. We have decided against the route of franchising and will have managers in each area. The great thing about the business is that the site and content management system behind it can easily be tailor made to suit the needs of the area. Plus, much of the content we already have can be applied across all locations. 7. If you started again, is there anything you'd do differently?

U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

Technology stocks continue to gain steam from this morning's
rally, which was triggered after a duo of tech companies, Xilinx
and Comverse Technology, boosted hopes that the bad news on
technology spending may be coming to an end. This helped bolster
investor confidence despite the weak economic data that was
released this morning. Semiconductors, networkers and software
stocks all powered the NASDAQ higher for an almost 3% gain.
General market sectors bucking the upward trend were mostly
defensive in nature and included electricity, natural gas and
tobacco shares. While it took them a little while longer to join
the tech party, both the Dow and S&P 500 crept higher throughout
the morning.

U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY

Treasuries were enjoying another day in the green at midday as a
bout of weak economic data helped all maturities rally and mostly
ignore the gains in the stock market. Trading remained thin and
lackluster as typical summer doldrums continued to thwart
liquidity. Shorter-dated issues received a boost from the Federal
Reserve's purchase of Treasury bills. Longer-dated issues have
been cheered from weakness in the factory orders report and data
on the non-manufacturing sector.

70,2,22836," low-retention at the wet-end even at the relatively low paper machine operating speeds which prevailed at that time. In addition, the polyvinyl alcohol product described in Toland et al is soluble in water at 130.degree.F. Since many paper machine chests are maintained at prevailing temperatures of 130.degree. F., or higher, the process described in the Toland et al patent would therefore be ineffectual in most, if not all, papermaking applications.
In a 1973 publication by John Wiley and Sons on the subject of polyvinyl alcohol, Chapter 12 is devoted to discussions of the use of this product in paper manufacturing. Among other subjects, the subject of ""internally sizing"" paper with polyvinyl alcohol is addressed and references the above-noted Toland et al patent and additionally Japanese Patent No. 12,608 relating to layered board and assigned to Nippon Gohsei of Osaka, Japan. The publication describes the desirable properties of a polyvinyl alcohol product which purportedly can be used as a wet-end additive and identifies a particular grade sold by Nippon Gohsei, ""Gohsenol P-250,"" as suitable for direct addition to beater size. The Gohsenol P-250 product is described in the publication as 98-99 mole percent hydrolyzed and as having a dissolving temperature of 67.degree.-70.degree. C.
In a 1982 technical paper presented during the 982 TAPPI Papermakers Conference, Dr. David Zunker of E.I.duPont deNemours & Company, Inc. describes the significant problem in achieving any retention of polyvinyl alcohol at a wet-end of a paper machine. In that paper, the use of mixtures of polyvinyl alcohol and cationic trimethylolmelamine as a binder is proposed as a solution to the retention problem. The use of ""TMM"" as proposed by Dr. Zunker, or alternatively the use of cationic starch as a retention aid for polyvinyl alcohol has not been successful, however, because the negatively-charged anionic white water quickly neutralizes the positive cationic charges of the starch or TMM after the paper machine reaches equilibrium in its white water system. In addition, TMM is a known enhancer of wet-strength properties which presents distinct problems in repulping any fully dried broke for reuse as furnish.
Nevertheless, the use of polyvinyl alcohol as a binder for use in making paper products and other webs has increased in recent years. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,937,865 discloses the use of polyvinyl alcohol as a binder for non-woven glass fiber webs. The polyvinyl alcohol used is a powder or suspension. The glass fiber webs bonded with the polyvinyl alcohol are generally impregnated with a solution of epoxy resin, arranged as a laminate, and compressed at elevated pressure and temperature to form the final laminate.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,691 discloses the use of a particular grade of polyvinyl alcohol which is super-hydrolyzed and which is substantially insoluble in water maintained at 130.degree. F. as a ""wet-end additive"" to internally strengthen paper based products. The particular polyvinyl alcohol used has been introduced only recently for use in surface sizing. The product is processed from material imported from China. Unlike its domestic counterparts, the grade of polyvinyl alcohol used in U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,691 is a fully hydrated wet-end additive having a characteristic branched appearance and a consistency much like that of cellulose fiber. The particles have a wood fiber-like appearance as contrasted with commercial domestic grades having a uniform, generally ""crystalline"" and spherical appearance under magnification. In the manufacture of the polyvinyl alcohol product a single screw saponifier or hydrolyzer is utilized rather than the prevailing contemporary belt or tank reactors which are in use in the United States. The screw saponifier draws the polyvinyl alcohol during saponification. As a result, wood fiber-like particles are produced having a relatively low dry bulk density which swell extensively when fully hydrated. The addition of the polyvinyl alcohol at the wet-end is exemplified in the examples of U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,691 to generally be in an amount ranging from about 0.25 to about 1 percent on an oven-dried weight basis for the pulp.

VBA File Dialog.FileName removing.1 from end of file name

I am using visual basic to write a Macro for Autodesk Inventor. I created a macro that calls a file dialog, see code below. Everything works fine except when a user puts a file name in with a period and a number greater than zero following it. 
For example, if a user puts testfile.test in the box and hits ok. When I ask for what they put in there using.FileName, I get ""testfile.test"". Just like I should. 
However, if the user puts testfile.1 or testfile.10 or testfile.1mdksj or anything as long as a number greater than zero directly follows the period I get back ""testfile"". For some reason, everything after the period and the period gets removed. 
What is the reason for this? Is this a bug in visual basic or am I doing something wrong?

Fact: Unlike alcohol, nicotine, and tranquillizers, antidepressants don’t require frequent dosage increases to maintain a certain effect, and they do not cause the user to crave them.While not addictive, those using antidepressants classified as SSRIs and SNRIs do experience withdrawal effects that sometimes can last for months.Some indicators of withdrawal include upset stomach, flu-like symptoms, anxiety, strange dreams, and dizziness.

Antidepressants also carry a long list of potential side effects, ranging from mild to severe, which should be discussed with a medical professional prior to beginning treatment.But rest assured that antidepressants aren’t addictive.

81,12,18251,"The present invention relates generally to computers and communications, and more specifically, to a method and system for moving personal information over computer networks.
It is well known that data communication networks such as the Internet, Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Local Area Networks (LANs), offer efficient and ubiquitous means of organizing and distributing computerized data. These attributes have resulted in their widespread use for both business and personal applications. For example, the Internet is now a common medium for operating online auctions, academic and public forums, distributing publications such as newspapers and magazines, and performing electronic commerce and electronic mail transactions.
New services are being provided over the Internet which are personalized or customized to users"""" requirements, which has resulted in personal data being stored in the service provider""""s domain. However, there are no effective ways for the user to easily relocate this personal data from one service provider to another; personal data residing with the old service provider must be manually re-entered with the new service provider.
FIG. 1 presents an exemplary system for a typical networked application or service, such as electronic mail (E-mail). The interconnection of various hosts and other devices is shown over an Internet 100. The Internet 100 consists of a vast interconnection of computers, servers, routers, computer networks and public telecommunication networks which allows two parties to communicate via whatever entities happen to be interconnected at any particular time. Presently, the systems that make up the Internet 100 comprise many different varieties of computer hardware and software. In general, this variety is not a great hindrance as the Internet 100 is unified by a small number of standard transport protocols.
Access to this Internet 100 is provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP) 130 who convert the various communication protocols used by end-user computers 140, 150 to the standard Internet protocols. For example, end users 140, 150 may be connected to an ISP 130 using wireless communications, or hardwired connections such as cable modems, television set-top boxes, or telephone line modems, using various technologies such as ADSL (asynchronous digital subscriber line), ISDN (integrated services digital network), or other known media and technologies.
Additionally, a number of Application Service Providers (ASP) 110, 120 are typically connected to the Internet 100. These ASPs 110, 120 are third-parties which provide software and other computer-based services to users across a wide area network from a remote location. Generally, these services are provided for a fee (usually monthly or yearly), though the ASPs 110, 120 may offer basic services for no cost and generate revenues in a peripheral manner, such as through advertising or sale of advanced services. The services offered by the ASPs 110, 120 might include:
commercial or personal banking;
investment services such as stock portfolio tracking;
calendar/appointment books;
contact lists, address books;

============

In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-driven production of mRNAs in the nucleus initiates gene expression. The nascent pre-mRNAs are processed and matured into mRNAs by several protein complexes that are loaded onto transcription sites via their interaction with the C-terminal domain of RNAPII (for reviews see [@bib49]; [@bib55]; [@bib11]). Processing and maturation events include the 5′ capping and splicing, and 3′ polyadenylation of the pre-mRNAs. Further, these steps are coupled to the dynamic interaction of mRNAs with several proteins, including export factors that facilitate their transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the cytoplasm. Studies over the past years have revealed that all steps during gene expression, starting from gene activation to the nuclear export of mRNAs, are tightly coupled ([@bib57]; [@bib49]; [@bib55]; [@bib32]).

In budding yeast, the THO--transcription export (TREX) complex and the Sac3--Thp1--Sus1--Cdc31 (TREX-2; also called THSC) complex are involved in transcription-coupled mRNA export ([@bib32]). The THO--TREX complex is thought to be recruited to the elongating RNAPII via the THO subunits (Hpr1, Tho2, Mft1, and Thp2), which function in transcription and biogenesis of mRNA protein complexes (messenger ribonucleoproteins \[mRNPs\]). The additional TREX factors Sub2 and Yra1 are involved in recruiting the Mex67-Mtr2 export receptor to the mRNP, thereby coupling mRNP biogenesis with their nuclear export (for reviews see [@bib1]; [@bib49]; [@bib32]). TREX-2 potentially coordinates Spt7-Ada2-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA)-mediated transcription of a subset of genes at the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC ([@bib51]). An integral component of TREX-2 is Sac3, a multidomain protein that serves as a binding platform for other members of the complex. The N-terminal and middle domain (N+M) of Sac3 binds Thp1 and Mex67-Mtr2, whereas the C-terminal domain mediates its NPC targeting ([@bib14]) and recruits the centrin Cdc31 as well as Sus1 ([@bib13]). Recent works from several groups have demonstrated a requirement of TREX-2 in the dynamic repositioning of a subset of gene loci from the nuclear interior to the nuclear periphery upon their activation ([@bib6]; [@bib8]; [@bib7]; [@"

88,28,26122,"When I was 7 years old, my neighbor Crystal (who was 9) came over to play. I had the biggest crush on her.

As we sat on my playground (practicing our backflips on the one support beam), she began telling me the story of Freddy Krueger and this new movie Nightmare on Elm Street. Even though I’m sure it was not a 100% factual recount of the movie, what she told me both thrilled and frightened me. I knew nothing of Freddy’s trademark sweater or hat, but I knew about that glove. I knew he was horribly burnt. I knew he wanted to hurt children. My imagination went into overdrive. In fact, I’m pretty sure I never had seen a picture of Freddy until the second NOES came out (I believe it was a full page ad in the newspaper.). A few years later, she could rap the entire song Nightmare on My Street. I still might have a crush on her.

The first Nightmare I ever sat down and watched was Dream Warriors (1987).

Dream Warriors plays like a fantasy adventure (and less like a horror movie). The cast is enjoyable to see interact, and even though we came to see Freddy dominate, we rooted for them to survive. There’s some issues (especially towards the end), but for the most part the dark humor and special effects work well.

The third installment picks up a few years after the first one. Kristen (Patricia Arquette) is having nasty dreams of Freddy, and he manages to slit her wrists in one. Kristen’s mother has her admitted to Westin Hills Hospital (which has got to be the scariest hospital I’ve ever seen in my life). Kristen meets Nancy (from the original NOES) who immediately recognizes that the teen is being tortured by her old foe. She meets a group of teenagers that are also suffering from nightmares.

The teens bond in their suffering and band together with Nancy (and their doctor Neil) to take on Freddy.

Although Freddy is a horror icon, Dream Warriors plays more as an fantasy adventure. This is the first movie that Freddy begins torturing the kids with their weaknesses. He was pretty straight forward in NOES, and he attacked the kids with horrific images. (For the sake of this review and our fond memories of Freddy, we’re going to pretend that NOES 2 doesn’t even exist. But….Freddy didn’t play with his prey before he caught it in that one either.) In this one, he knows what hurts each kid. He attacks Kristen by playing on her insecurities about her mom’s feelings about her. He uses a junkie’s addiction against her.

In contrast, the kids realize that they have special powers in their dreams. This “levels” the playing field and sets up additional sequels in the series as the kids do battle with Freddy on his turf. Even as a kid, I remember my mom telling me to do the same thing when I nightmare. It makes sense, and it works perfectly. It’s not “some kid learns martial arts while rocking out to Dokken’s Dream Warriors” montage. It’s what every kid does when they sleep: Dream we are bigger and stronger than what we are. It helps us connect to the characters.

There are quite a few memorable kills in Dream Warriors. We have the marionette kill, the television kill (which I still can’t figure out how they consider that a suicide–her feet are a good foot off the ground. How’d she swing that??), and the syringe fingers. All 3 of these rank high on style points for Freddy’s career.

The end does fall apart a little bit. For some reason, Neil has Nancy’s drunken father driving him around town. The hospital allows Nancy and Neil to be in contact with the kids despite blaming them for the deaths thus far. Freddy rips off his sweater to show off his abs (or should I say “soul patch”) for no relevant reason. Nancy declares victory waaaaaaay to early.

What I loved best about this third installment is that it starts to build the Freddy timeline. We learn that he is the “bastard son of a hundred madmen” (which has to be the greatest title bestowed upon an enemy ever). We learn about his mother, and we see the series take a turn from dark shadows to dark humor. Freddy peaked in this one as he managed to ride the fence between being scary and funny. Parts 4 (Dream Master) and 5 (Dream Child) really try to capture the magic this"

Introduction to Angel-Guided Star Creation Sigils™

VAL'S NAME AS STARS
See interpretation at end
of this post.

Ever wonder or imagine when looking up at the
stars shining so bright if you have a star among them? Do you believe that
stars are part of our own story to claim and to use to guide us?I was guided by Archangel Uriel to believe
that the star nation includes our own personal constellation, our cosmic energetic blueprint, and
that many more are created with our words, intentions and thoughts.

Is it any wonder that this blew my mind?

I came to believe and have begun my transformation into a greater, expanded reality by embracing my pure, archetype, star essence, and I am answering the call to invest in anyone who
also says ""Yes!"" to this sacred synchronicity opportunity. You are cordially invited to discover your own relationship to Angel-Guided Star Sigils™as as a pioneer in what is called the Greater Reality.

Deepen your investment in your story of spirituality; of being a humanitarian; of transforming; of growing; of manifesting;of changing; and of succeedingby becoming one with your own constellation.

A star sigil is a quantum ""warehouse"" that combines
archetypes, oracle guidance, angel numbers, universal consciousness keys, and
intuitive intelligence in one multidimensional star constellation that supports you and your creative becoming.

The ancients believed that astronomical phenomena were connected to terrestrial events. ~From ""Star of Bethlehem, Wikipedia

My healing artist palette includes, but is not limited to, the following:

What I provide is a mix of personal session time with you, and
additional amounts of time off-session performing calculations and creating sigils. Our personal time represents three-four hours
(depending upon what's best for you)that mayinclude:

a free 15 minute consultation session (Are We a Match?)

an Intuitive Intelligence
and Muscle Testing session (What We Need To Know)

a session to explore the best Angel-Guided Star Sigils™ offer for you

a session to review your sigil

a Digital Vision Board creative session

a CHILL™ - Chumpi Illumination session

Approximately
three (3) hours is spent calculating, creating, and interpreting your sigil. You
receive it via a link to view and download it. Future
follow-up sessions are scheduled if needed on a per hour payment basis.

Here are a some options for you, althoughstar sigils are determined based upon individual need beyond what you see offered below.

Note:The Angel-Guided Star Sigils™offers continue to evolve as I receive more angel guidancesincethey are dynamic forms, and more is emerging. I reserve the right to make changes as required to what I offer for the Highest Benefit.

What is a Sigil?Sigils are considered the marks of angels, deities, and other
entities, and arearchetypes, conduits for great creative quantum energy. My angel
guides gave me a sigil calculation formula by which to convert words(names and
sentences) into quantum energy-powered star constellations using sigils.

What is Intuitive Intelligence?Intuitive intelligence is a deep, instantaneous, inner feeling or inner knowing; a form of divine communication from one's highest consciousness, frequency or Self. It's been described as a gut feeling that may be associated with sounds or feelings in the body that confirmit.

For years, research on RNA modifications focused mainly on transfer RNAs (tRNAs) as a result of their relative abundance and their small size, with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) following after technological advances in sequencing methodology were made \[["

I also feel confident that ReAuthored will fit in quite nicely at Granny's. I was thrilled when Diane agreed and I am working away on a variety of products to place there. I'll even be making some custom frames to showcase these incredible cards by Chris McGee...

If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend checking out Granny's Antiques in Rocheport, MO. It is an incredible little town that is 10 miles and 100 years away from Columbia, MO. Eat lunch at the Rocheport General Store, shop at Granny's, drink some wine at Les Bourgeois winery, eat dinner at Abigail's, and stay at one of the many bed and breakfasts...all on the Missouri River.

Compared to that experience – which I outline in detail below – meeting my favorite TV outlaw proved about as easy as it would have been to toss an ewok anywhere within a three-foot radius in the comic-con convention center and manage to hit a virgin over the age of 45.

A chin that can not only take a punch, but can throw one too.

The line moved super fast and Bruce was not spending too much time chatting with each person. We were basically a line of Campbell cattle. I initially wanted to shake the man’s hand until I heard him deny the same request to a person right in front of me saying, “Shake your hand? That’s kind of cheesy… what are you, a politician?”. DOH! Change of plans.

When I got my 10 seconds of Campbell time, I quickly explained to him that I loved him in Brisco and was bummed about it getting the Firefly treatment (albeit this was before Firefly). He agreed and proceeded to comment on the less than stellar IQ level of many entertainment executives that tend to make ‘final’ decisions on those matters.

Oh yeah, we bonded…

I was also able to mention how Brisco County Jr. played a part in inspiring my blog for Geek Outlaw, and I graciously gifted him with not just one, but two of my very limited edition Geek Outlaw stickers. (Including having him sign one for myself). He actually smiled for what felt like half a nano second and seemed genuinely interested in the concept… or genuinely confused.

Seriously Bruce, my wiener dog could have made your signature more legible.

Despite the impromptu nature of the experience, it did send a bit of a tingle down my leg to meet the cowboy that helped open the door to my western sci-fi geekiness. I will remember it always as I’m positive he will too… for as long as it took him to autograph the next Spider-Man poster.

Smoking VS Vaping

Comparing Smoking To Vaping

Facts About Smoking Tobacco

Everyone knows that smoking is dangerous and horribly bad for your body as well as the people around you. The facts about cigarettes are absolutely astounding:

Just one cigarette contains over 4,800 chemicals—69 of those are known to cause cancer.

The average smoker in the United States spends $1,500 to $3,300 each year on cigarettes.

Secondhand smoke exposure accounts for approximately 50,000 deaths each year in the United States.

According to the World Health Organization, 15 Billion cigarettes are smoked worldwide every day.

69% of smokers want to quit completely.

8.6 million people in the US live with a serious illness that was caused by smoking.

Facts about Vaping

98,2,25711,"Sixteen-year-old Monica buried her face in a pillow, trying to rest for school the next day, as the clock ticked past 11 p.m.

Sleep was a battle in the tiny apartment. Hunched at the other end of the family’s only mattress, two of her brothers played a video game while a third lounged next to her, watching virtual soccer players skitter on screen. Her 2-year-old niece toddled barefoot near the door, toying with a pile of pennies.

In all, seven people live in this wedge of space in Historic South-Central, including Monica’s mother and the mother of the little girl — the longtime girlfriend of one of her brothers. They squeeze into an apartment roughly the size of a two-car garage, sharing a bathroom, a small kitchen and one common room.

“We’re not comfortable,” Monica’s mother, Josefina Cano, said in Spanish. “But what can we do? It’s better than being on the street.”


Cano and her family live in one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the country. Nearly 45% of the homes there are considered “crowded” — having more than one person per room, excluding bathrooms, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data spanning 2008 to 2012. Almost one home in six is severely crowded, with more than two people per room.

Southern California is an epicenter for crowded housing: Out of the most heavily crowded 1% of census tracts across the country, more than half are in Los Angeles and Orange counties, a Times statistical analysis found. They are sprinkled throughout areas such as Westlake and Huntington Park around Los Angeles, and Santa Ana and Anaheim in Orange County.

INTERACTIVE: Mapping the country’s crowded homes

From the outside looking in, it is a largely invisible phenomenon. Places such as Maywood and Huntington Park, south of Los Angeles, look little like the high-rises of Chicago or Boston. Yet behind the closed doors of small bungalows or squat apartment buildings, they are home to thousands more people per square mile than those large cities.


“This is an example of poverty that can go unseen in our communities,” said Jason Mandell, United Way of Greater Los Angeles spokesman. “It’s easy to miss if you’re not paying attention.”

The crowding is felt in ways big and small.

Around South Gate and Huntington Park, Head Start instructors who visit children at home find they have trouble focusing amid the hubbub. In the Florence-Firestone area, longtime resident Paula Trejo said, street parking is always scarce.

UCLA and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers have found that children in crowded homes have poorer health, worse scores on math and reading tests and more behavioral and emotional problems — such as tantrums and depression — even when poverty is taken into account.

106,26,27585,". (2016) proposes a different people, likely from Iran, as the source for the Middle Eastern ancestry of the Yamnaya people, finding that ""a population related to the people of the Iran Chalcolithic contributed ~43% of the ancestry of early Bronze Age populations of the steppe"". That study asserts that these Iranian Chalcolithic people were a mixture of ""the Neolithic people of western Iran, the Levant, and Caucasus Hunter Gatherers"". However, a different analysis, carried out by Gallego-Llorente et al. (2016), concludes that Iranian populations are not a likelier source of the'southern' component in the Yamnaya than Caucasus hunter-gatherers.

Genetic relationship with the Catacomb culture
A genetic study published in August 2014 examined the DNA of the remains of a number of individuals from the Yamnaya culture and the Catacomb culture, who succeeded the Yamnaya culture as the dominant force on the Pontic steppe. Catacomb people were found to have much higher frequencies of the maternal haplogroups U5 and U4 than people of the Yamnaya culture. Haplogroups U5 and U4 are typical of Western Hunter-Gatherers and Eastern Hunter-Gatherers. A generic similarity between Catacomb people and northern hunter-gatherers, particularly the people of the Pitted Ware culture of southern Scandinavia, was detected. It was suggested that the Catacomb people and the Yamnaya people were not as genetically admixed as previously believed. Interestingly, the modern population of Ukraine was found to be more closely related to people of the Yamnaya culture than people of the Catacomb culture.

Haplogroups
Haplogroup R1b is the most common Y-DNA haplogroup found among both the Yamnaya and modern-day Western Europeans.

In 2015 studies published in Nature, the remains of twelve individuals ascribed to the Yamna culture were analyzed. Eleven individuals were determined to belong to haplogroup R1b1a2 (R-V88) or various subclades of it, while one individual was determined to belong to haplogroup I2a2a1b1b.

A February 2018 study published in Nature included an analysis of a Yamnaya male in Bulgaria. He carried haplogroup I2a2a1b1b.

107,7,9216,"""Startling"" is a word you don't often hear from an Alaskan meteorologist with over three decades of experience, especially in a place used to wild swings in weather. But this month's warmth in the state is out of bounds, even for Rick Thoman.

The climate expert at NOAA's Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy used the word when stating that the month of March — for Alaska as a whole — will be the 29th month since January 2013 to be ranked in the warmest ten percent since 1925.

And it's likely to get even warmer as we round out the month. On Saturday, villages along the northern coast of Alaska, right on the Arctic Ocean, are expected to spike to 40 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.

""March is now so warm that not only is it certain that this will be the warmest March, but would be warm enough to be in the top 10 Aprils!"" Thoman said about the temperatures in Alaska.

This is startling: for Alaska as a whole, March is going to be the 29th month since Jan 2013 to be ranked in the warmest ten percent since 1925. That's 39% of months. In the same period, one month, April 2013, ranks in the coldest 10%. #akwx #Arctic @Climatologist49 @IARC_Alaska pic.twitter.com/VucrVBvJT5 — Rick Thoman (@AlaskaWx) March 27, 2019

At least three cities in the northern half of the state — Deadhorse, Kotzebue and Eagle — are expected to soon shatter records for the largest March departure from normal for any city in the U.S. by the end of the month, according to climatologist Brian Brettschneider.

It should be noted that while temperatures are running 23 degrees above normal in Deadhorse, the average March temperature there is 13 below zero — so the weather is"

En la Ciudad faltan docentes. De hecho, en 2017 quedaron 144 cargos de maestro de grado sin cubrir. Asimismo, cada vez se reciben menos en los institutos de formación. Ante ese panorama, desde el gobierno porteño creen que la solución radica en la creación de una universidad pública y gratuita que concentre a los 29 institutos de formación que hoy existen.

Frente a esta iniciativa de la Ciudad, los gremios docentes ya expresaron su rechazo -argumentan que se enteraron ""por los medios""- y amenazaron con medidas de fuerza. Todo esto pese a que las autoridades aseguraron que el proyecto no pone en riesgo los empleos de los profesores que hoy dictan clases en los institutos que se desintegrarán.

Cristina Núñez, secretaria gremial de SADOP, dijo a Infobae: ""Más allá de la promesa, no tenemos ninguna certeza. La medida, que surgió sin diálogo y de la cabeza de tres iluminados atrás de un escritorio, pone en riesgo muchos puestos de trabajo"".

En tanto, Jorge Adaro, secretario general de Ademys, remarcó: ""Rechazamos enfáticamente la disolución de los institutos. Lo mismo hicieron en Jujuy. La universidad no deja de ser un anuncio abstracto muy marketinero del que todavía no se sabe nada. Buscan responsabilizar al docente de los fracasos escolares"".

Los sindicatos ya tienen planteadas distintas instancias en los próximos días en las que resolverán, a través de asambleas, las medidas a tomar. Todos aclaran, sin embargo, que ""el paro es una posibilidad concreta que está contemplada"" y que pretenden llegar a un acuerdo en conjunto para definir el curso de acción. En caso de que se oficialice la medida, resta saber cómo finalizará el calendario escolar, sabiendo que en los 29 colegios donde hubo tomas tendrán clases hasta el 29 de diciembre.

La iniciativa de la universidad se oficializó ayer en una presentación en el Museo de Arte Moderno. Allí el jefe de gobierno porteño, Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, habló de ""recuperar la vocación docente perdida"". Sobre ello, UTE se manifestó a través de un comunicado. ""Dice que no hay maestros porque hay una crisis vocacional en la Ciudad. ¿Por qué en otras ciudades o provincias no falta vocación docente? ¿La vocación aparece repentinamente al cruzar la avenida General Paz?"".

La razón de la falta de maestros, dicen, pasa por ""la reducción sistemática del presupuesto educativo y la estigmatización a los docentes"" y adv"

112,19,11969,"British Somali teenagers are being taken back to their parents’ homeland under the pretence of a holiday and then kept in detention centres before being forced into marriages.

Under the practice of dhaqan celis, loosely translated as “the rehabilitation community”, Somali children and teenagers are routinely taken to the country, where they are often sent to “rehabilitation” centres.

The centres promote themselves as “re-education” schools to align young people with Somali cultural values and their Somali roots. The Home Office, however, says they tend not to deliver an academic curriculum and are in fact detention centres where young people are routinely subjected to physical, sexual and mental abuse. In some cases, those held against their will are told the only way out is to get married.

David Myers, joint head of the Home Office’s forced marriage unit (FMU) in the UK, said: “What we are seeing in these communities is that young people who have antisocial behaviour issues, are getting involved in gangs and drugs, and are being sent back to Somalia by their parents for re-education and rehabilitation.

Home secretary vows to take action over forced marriages Read more

“The concept in Somali culture, dhaqan celis, means returning to the culture to help them rehabilitate and they are sent to what they call schools but what we call detention centres. We have had reports of physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse within these centres, where they are kept in really strict conditions.

“These teenagers and children are told that the only way they can escape these centres is to get married to another Somalian and that is where the forced marriage element comes into it.”

The latest figures show there has been a 100% year-on-year increase in the number of forced marriage cases handled by Home Office involving Somali children and teenagers. In 2017, the figure rose to 91, more than India.

Myers said: “The Somalia case is unusual. Traditionally, when you look at these cases you always think of South Asian communities but the Somalian community is a new and emerging community in the UK and the second generation are coming of age.”

The number of cases reported to the FMU in 2017 was more than double the number received the previous year. Almost 75% of the victims, some younger than 15, were already overseas when they contacted the FMU.

There were calls from 65 females and 26 males. Of those, 23 were under the age of 15. London had the highest number of victims at 64. Seven came from north-west England.

When the Guardian contacted a number of UK-based Somali community organisations and charities, most said they had not heard of the practice or denied that forced marriage involving British Somali nationals was taking place.

Sahra Abdi, the head of the Lodge Lane Somali women’s group in Liverpool, said forced marriage was not a problem within the Somali communities in the north of England and was concentrated in London.

Abdi, a mother of six, once missed a flight to Somalia after being questioned by police at the airport. She was travelling with her three daughters aged 14, 12 and 10. She said officers were concerned she was taking her daughters back to Somalia to force them to marry.

That was two years ago. Abdi said she had never heard of forced marriage involving Somali British nationals in Liverpool: “I don’t think this is happening in Liverpool. It’s probably going on in London. Because Somali children in London get involved in drugs. Most of this is happening in London. Never heard of Somali people in Liverpool taking their children for forced marriage.

117,19,27275,"Q:

Normal distribution - values are recorded to the nearest 10th of a kilogram problem

I am having problems with understanding the solution to the following exercise, which is as follows:

The weights of a large number of miniature poo-
  dles are approximately normally distributed with a
  mean of 8 kilograms and a standard deviation of 0.9
  kilogram. If measurements are recorded to the nearest
  tenth of a kilogram, find the fraction of these poodles
  with weights
  (a) over 9.5 kilograms;
  (b) of at most 8.6 kilograms;
  (c) between 7.3 and 9.1 kilograms inclusive

now, the solution is:
(a)  $ = P(X >
9.55) = P(Z > 1.72) = 0.0427. $
(b)  $ = P(X <
8.65) = P(Z < 0.72) = 0.7642. $
(c)
 $= P(7.25 < X < 9.15) = P(−0.83 < Z < 1.28) = 0.8997 − 0.2033 = 0.6964. $
Now, I have successfully completed the exercise a). The exercise said that the measurements are recorded to the nearest tenth of a kilogram. What I did in a) was add half a kilogram to 9.5 which gives us 9.55 because it's the first higher value (>) which is recorded
However, in b) my solution was 
b) $P(X≤8.6)$,
and in 
c) $P(7.25 ≤ X ≤ 9.00).$
My method was to add half a kilogram to the x value whenever the sign was ""greater or equal to"", and to subtract half a kilogram from the x value whenever the sign was ""less or equal to"".
Obviously my ""trick"" did not work in those two exercises and I have no clue why. Can anyone help?

A:

One way to conceptualize the model here is to think of two random variables, say $Y$, which is the weighed value to the nearest $0.1$ kg, and the true value $X$, which is not observable due to the limited instrument precision.  So if $Y = 8.2$ kg observed, this means that $X$ is some value in the interval $[8.15, 8.25)$.
Then what we are given is that $$X \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\mu = 8, \sigma = 0.9),$$ not $Y$, because the latter is a rounded value, thus it is not possible to observe $Y = 8.2353$, for example.  You'd observe $Y = 8.2$ instead.
We are asked in Part (a) to compute $\Pr[Y > 9.5]$ the probability of poodles whose observed weights exceed $9.5$ kg.  This of course must correspond to $\Pr[X \ge 9."

to about 15-20', repeatedly).

I'm having a good time with the Brits and their Brit humor. Earlier, someone
uttered the phrase, ""you could see her tonsils through her rectum.""
You'd probably never hear an American string words together like that. :)

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 21: MOUNT MOKARRAN

12:21 - Hammerhead!! Two great hammerheads (and a beautiful frigate bird) are
circling the boat here at Mount Mokarran. One is probably just over 10', and the
other is said to be about the same size (I just spent 45 minutes with one of them
and didn't see the other one). Anna did a fantastic job wrangling the shark onto
the dive platform, which gave all of us opportunities to get some chomping shots.
He (the shark) was completely unafraid, gliding between us at arm's length.

I believe that perfectly sums up our recent misconceptions on diet. Fat isn't the problem, Sugar is! In Canada we were indoctrinated with the Canada food guide for a decades telling us things like “a glass of juice is the equivalent of 2 servings of fruit”. Fruit juice is packed with sugar, as a single glass of juice is made up of a number of fruits, but it is missing the fibre and phytonutrients of a raw fruit.





In the hopes of living a healthier lifestyle my family started researching more and more which led us to is something called the KETO diet. Keto is an ULTRA LOW CARB diet. There are many different versions of the diet a 4-1 ratio a 3-1 ratio and then one called the modified Atkins as some examples. The basic principle is that you eat a lot of fat, a small amount of protein and almost no carbohydrates at all (20 net grams a day). Now while I haven’t been strictly following a hard 4-1 rule I have been limiting my carbs by not keeping classic carbohydrates in the house and have been actively eating more fats.





Why is it called KETO? It is called KETO because the body produces small food molecules called KETONES, when there is a short supply of glucose in the body. The body produces KETONES in the liver from fat, (which is why you eat so much of it) next it will target stored body fat, this leads often to weight loss.





What is the major way to cut your carbs down to such extreme levels? Stop eating bread, potatoes, rice, sweet drinks and no more adding sugar to any foods.





Now what are some of the scary things that we hear when we talk about decreasing our carbohydrate intake? A HUGE LOSS in ENERGY! That is probably the biggest one. This is problematic in sport.





For me this has not only been untrue but in fact I would say the opposite. We ride a rollercoaster of energy levels all day everyday based on the food we ingest. Often times we don’t eat out of hunger, but we also eat because we feel a drop in our energy levels, or drowsy especially after lunch.





This is a symptom of the food that we eat. Who isn’t sleepy after their big turkey dinner. It isn’t because of the TRYPTOPHAN, There is actually more tryptophan in chicken. So why are we so sleepy? Because of the dinner rolls, stuffing, carrots, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, and gravy thickened with flour. That is carbs on top of carbs packaged in carbs. Staying awake after that is a modern miracle. I have been drinking less coffee than I have in years and rarely have an afternoon lull.

Another benefit is that foods that are rich in fat are also rich in flavour, whipping cream, pork belly, nuts and cheese are delicious. Not feeling guilty about the amount of dressing on my caesar salad (sans croutons) was beautiful music"

130,20,10626,"Will military leaders' shift on gay troops sway GOP?

WASHINGTON — A North Carolina gay-rights group is asking a leading Republican lawmaker on military issues to join its fight to repeal the Pentagon's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy, which bans gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.

However, North Carolina Rep. Sue Myrick, while a strong supporter of the military, isn't yet in line with many of the military's top officers, led by Navy Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who have called for the policy's repeal.

The issue is a rare one that divides the Pentagon's top leaders, along with much of the rank-and-file, and the GOP's socially conservative base.

Myrick, who's been a vocal opponent of gay rights, received a 91 percent rating from the American Conservative Union in 2008. In 2004, she was a leading supporter of legislation to keep states from recognizing same-sex marriage, and she told reporters that the topic triggered more calls and e-mails to her office than any other issue.

The nation's leading gay rights advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign, has given Myrick a rating of ""zero,"" the same as the state's other Republicans in the House of Representatives.

The Charlotte Rainbow Action Network for Equality, or CRANE, plans to rally Friday and launch its ""March for Myrick"" campaign. Matt Comer, a Charlotte resident and the group's organizer, said the group chose to focus on Myrick, who was elected to the House in 1994, because of her work on military issues.

""Representative Myrick has very much a pro-military, pro-national security record,"" Comer said. ""In past couple years, she's spoken out on issues, especially when it comes to the war on terror. Since she does place such an importance on military readiness, it makes no sense she would not sponsor the military readiness bill.""

In the next month, supporters hope to gather 13,500 plastic toy soldiers to deliver to Myrick's office at the end of March. The soldiers represent the estimated 13,500 troops who've been kicked out of the military for being gay since the policy took effect in 1993, Comer said. Since 2001, the number of troops discharged under the policy has declined, despite a massive increase in the size of the military.

In a statement to the Charlotte Observer, Myrick said she agrees with other officers, including Gens. George Casey, the Army chief of staff, and Norton Schwartz, the top Air Force officer, who argue that with the country at war, the issue needs more study.

""I support the position held by Gens. George Casey and Norton Schwartz, and believe that the military should finish its study on the impact of repealing the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy before any Congressional action is taken,"" Myrick said.

Comer said he hopes to meet with Myrick within the next month, but that he isn't optimistic that she'll support repealing the policy.

""The chances of her changing her mind and co-sponsoring this are slim to none,"" Comer said.

Lawmakers introduced H.R. 1283, the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, nearly a year ago in the House, with 188 co-sponsors. The bill would repeal the policy and ban discrimination in the military on the basis of sexual orientation for admissions and personnel actions.

There's a growing push in Washington to overturn ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" which was put in place by President Bill Clinton. It prohibits gay troops from disclosing their sexual orientation, and it also prevents"

The Herald also highlighted Taylor's links with ""dubious deals in Serbia, Iraq, Iran and Libya"", as well as UK tax avoidance behaviour. Taylor responded by threatening the Herald, National Collective and another pro-independence website, Wings Over Scotland, with legal action for defamation. National Collective closed its website down for several days, before replacing the article in question with a slightly edited version that included responses from Vitol. On 16 April 2013, the Herald published a response from Vitol's public relations (PR) firm to the allegations as an appendix to its original article. Wings Over Scotland ignored the initial threat, but then challenged a second letter without amending its piece.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie defended the use of Taylor's money, saying: ""If it's good enough for Harris tweed, it should be good enough for Better Together."" A YouGov poll undertaken on behalf of the SNP in May 2013 suggested that 43% of Scots surveyed wanted the donation money to be returned; compared to 34%, who believed the money did not need to be returned.

Campaign

Better Together ran a range of paid advertisements in cinemas before cinema chains opted to ban referendum advertising, billboard advertising and paid newspaper advertising. Advertising agency M&C Saatchi were used by the campaign.

The campaign's social media and engagement strategy was arranged with Blue State Digital.

Campaigning activity

On 30 June, the campaign stated that it was the ""largest grassroots movement in Scottish political history"". It observed that over 280 local groups had been involved in over 2,000 campaign events, more than 4.5 million leaflets had been delivered and more than 370,000 doors had been directly canvassed – imploring work to continue.

Labour MP Jim Murphy pursued a ""100 Streets in 100 Days"" tour around Scotland, speaking on a mobile stage of two Irn-Bru crates. Following an incident where Murphy was attacked with eggs in Kirkcaldy, he suspended his tour citing ""co-ordinated abuse"" from Yes supporters on 29 August. It resumed on 2 September with engagements in Edinburgh, with Murphy stating that the ""noisy tap of mob mentality"" had been turned-off.

Television debates

Two televised debates were organised between the lead campaigns in the closing weeks of the campaign. Split between the BBC and STV channels, both debates featured Alistair Darling for Better Together and Alex Salmond for Yes Scotland.

The first debate, STV's Salmond & Darling: The Debate was held over two hours on 5 August 2014, broadcast from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow. Post"

I hope that you find these New Year’s resolutions from Trulia useful. Got any resolutions for the real estate industry that we should be considering?

Trulia update
Here is a quick update on what has been going on with Trulia in the last 12 months and where we’re headed.

Today, Trulia.com is the fastest growing website in the real estate industry according to Comscore (at least amongst the top 20 sites). In December 2007 Trulia.com will have around 2.5million unique visitors, we have grown 3x in 12 months whereas many other sites have flat or declining in traffic. We consistently see double digit monthly growth and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future until we become one of the top few sites in the Industry.

Trulia has been launching lots of products in 2007 as well as coming out of Beta, some highlights: in May we launched the useful and popular Trulia Voices community; in November we launched our integrated Foreclosure search and also in November made available our agent listing advertising product. We will be launching many more products and services in 2008 as well as improving many of the existing products on Trulia.com. We are particularly excited about building on the early success of Trulia Voices and become the leading online community for home buyers, sellers, agents and enthusiasts.

In 2007 we raised an additional $10m lead by Sequoia Capital with participation from existing investors such as Accel Partners and have raised a total of around $18m to date. It’s a great endorsement for the Trulia business model, chosen strategy and the team here from some of smartest and most successful minds in technology. Trulia has approximately doubled its staff to around 55 employees in 12 months (and we’re hiring). Most importantly, we’ve continued to deliver great value to our real estate industry partners and other advertisers. As a result of making our clients happy, we’re now starting to generate pretty significant revenues and with Trulia’s capital efficient model and a highly sought after audience, we’ll be focused on achieving profitability in 2008. Since inception, our goal has been to build a marketing platform that delivers greater value at a lower cost than any other option out there, whether online or offline. This is a great start and we will continue on this path. We’ll let you know how we get on in 2008.

Wishing you all a very Happy New Year and good luck with your own New Year resolutions from everyone at Trulia!

Each outlet also employs a deacon, who sanctifies everything before its shipped to locals stores. It would be sort of like the kosher food deal, but, you know, Christier.
And voila: moneymaker! The 96% of the American population currently on the Atkins diet could enjoy all those baked goods they’ve had to forego, without having to worry about meddlesome carbs. Thanks to the (literal!) miracle of transubstantiation, those WWAD cinnamon rolls and bagels will"

Right Wing Limericks

by Al Bienstock

OBAMACARE PERSUASION

The Obamacare plan is pure junk.
Grade the plan and the rollout â€“ they flunk.
So, Barack has a plan â€“
If you are a barman,
Sell it by getting young people drunk.

Washington Examiner, 12/5/13: ""During today's White House Youth Summit, President Obama called on young people to do whatever then can to promote his signature health Care law â€“ including plying their customers with cheap booze. 'If you're a bartender, have A happy hour,' Obama said...""

OBAMACARE SECURITY RISK

For consumer fraud on a grand scale,
On security, their grade is Fail.
Personal info at risk?
Their response is, tsk tsk.
Obama's team should all be in jail.

The Daily Caller, 12/4/13: ""A 'good-guy hacker' who probed for weaknesses in the security systems of HealthCare.gov told Fox News on Wednesday that 'no security was built into this entire infrastructure' and that citizens' personal data is at serious risk.""

CAN'T KEEP YOUR PLAN, DOCS OR DRUGS

Obamacare deserves lots of ""ughs.""
Its developers â€“ a bunch of thugs â€“
From the start were aware
That they'd destroy healthcare.
The latest is... you can't keep your drugs.

Forbes, 12/9/13: ""Simply put, many drugs may not be covered at all, and the costs patients incur by buying them with cash won't count against out of pocket caps.""

INCOME REDISTRIBUTION

Leftists shout that taxes should be ""fair""
And the wealthy should pay their ""fair share.""
But the truth libs abhor
Is that the ""rich"" pay more
(A fact of which we should be aware).

Left-wingers choose to misrepresent
What tax payments by the ""rich"" have meant.
The poorest four in ten
Pay less than nothing, when
Their net's minus nine-point-one percent.

CNS News, 12/9/13: ""The top 40 percent of households by before-tax income actually paid 106.2 percent of the nation's net income taxes in 2010, according to a new study by the Congressional Budget Office. At the same time, households in the bottom 40 percent took in an average of $18,950 in what CBO called 'government transfers' in 2010. Taxpayers in the top 40 percent of households were able to pay more than 100 percent of net federal income taxes in 2010 because Americans in the bottom 10 percent actually paid negative income taxes, according to the CBO study entitled 'The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2010'...

These pathways need not be mutually exclusive: we have shown in primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells that addition of LM-332 to collagen matrices alters the mechanism of coordinating \[Ca^2+^\]~i~changes among neighbouring cells \[[@B26],[@B31]-[@B34]\]. These changes in the coordination of Ca^2+^waves were accompanied by alterations of connexin isoform expression patterns and affected by cellular differentiation.

In this study we grew ciliated rabbit tracheal epithelial cells (RTEC) on substrates of LM-332/collagen or collagen alone and monitored functional dye coupling, propagation of intercellular Ca^2+^waves following mechanical stimulation, and alterations in connexin isoform expression. We found that, independent of the matrix substratum, ciliated RTEC were functionally coupled by low molecular weight dyes, although the incidence of dye coupling was increased by LM-332. Ciliated RTEC propagated intercellular Ca^2+^waves in response to mechanical stimulation on both matrices tested. However, cells grown on LM-332/collagen matrix propagated Ca^2+^waves via an extracellular nucleotide pathway whereas cells grown on collagen alone propagated Ca^2+^waves via gap junctions. Direct immunocytochemical staining of connexins showed a cellular rearrangement of at least three isoforms, Cx26, Cx43 and Cx46, in response to LM-332/collagen matrix. We suggest that similar changes of extracellular matrix proteins *in vivo*(e.g., during development, wound repair or disease) lead to changes in intercellular signalling that are important in coordinating upper airway epithelial tissue function.

DISCUSSION
I. CHALLENGES TO CONVICTION
A. Waived Issues

9
Vought has waived two issues.  First, after filing his brief in this court, Vought moved to withdraw his argument that the district court erred by denying his motion either to dismiss count I (conspiracy) or to preclude the introduction of certain statements.  This panel granted that motion on July 24, 1995.


10
Second, although Vought stated in his opening brief that the district court erred by failing to suppress Vought's January 15, 1993 statement, he did not provide any argument on the issue.  We accordingly deem the issue abandoned and decline to consider it.  See United States v. Alonso, 48 F.3d 1536, 1544-45 (9th Cir.1995);  Collins v. City of San Diego, 841 F.2d 337, 339 (9th Cir.1988).

B. Suppression Motion

11
Vought argues that the fruits of the warrantless searches of the Sophie Station Hotel room and his Anchorage apartment should have been suppressed.  He asserts that the searches were impermissible because the parole officers who conducted the searches were acting as ""stalking horses"" for the police, thus enabling the police to circumvent the warrant requirement.  ""Whether or not a parole or probation officer is acting as a stalking horse is a question of fact, reviewed for clear error.""  United States v. Richardson, 849 F.2d 439, 441 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 866, 109 S.Ct. 171, 102 L.Ed.2d 141 (1988).


12
Allen and Tanner had received information, independently of law enforcement authorities, that Vought was engaging in activities that constituted parole violations.  Although they accompanied law enforcement officers on an ultimately fruitless surveillance of Vought, the subsequent decision to search the Sophie Station Hotel room was made solely by the parole officers.  The police had no prior knowledge of the search and they did not participate in it.  In fact, the police were only notified after the parole officers found the 3.2 pounds of cocaine.  Similarly, the search of the Anchorage apartment had been discussed in advance by parole officers Tanner and Polhemus.  The search was conducted by Polhemus and a DEA agent, pursuant to Polhemus' normal procedure.


13
The district court's conclusion, that the parole officers were not acting as ""stalking horses"" because they initiated and conducted both searches independently of the police, is not clearly erroneous.  See Richardson, 849 F.2d at 441-42.  Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Vought's suppression motion.

C. Jencks Act Challenge

14
Vought claims that at trial he sought production, under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500, of statements made by Maurer.  He was provided with partially redacted copies of her statements.  He now objects because the district court did not order production of recordings or transcripts of Maurer's statements.  However, Vought never made such a request at trial.  We accordingly need not reach the merits of this claim because Vought did not properly raise it before the district court.  See United States v. Hanna, 55 F.3d 1456, 1459 (9th Cir.1995).  As we stated in Hanna, ""[p]roduction of statements covered by the Jencks Act... is not automatic....  'The burden rests upon the defendant to invoke the statute....' ""  Id.  (quoting United States v. Burke, 506 F.2d 1165, 1168 (9th Cir.1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 915, 95 S.Ct. 1576, 43 L.Ed.2d 781 (1975)).  Vought's failure to request at trial the materials he now argues should have"

After chicken has browned on both sides, you may need to add a bit more olive oil at this point so the chicken doesn’t stick. Place skillet with chicken on the bottom rack in the preheated oven and bake 15 - 20 minutes, or until chicken is golden brown on both sides and its internal temperature reads 160 degrees F on an instant read thermometer. It may take longer to cook, depending on the size and thickness of your chicken.

Remove chicken to a cooling rack and let rest for ten minutes. This is an important step, because if you put the chicken it on a paper towel right away, it will steam and the crust tends to come off.

William J. Baxley, Atty. Gen., H. Young Dempsey, Asst. Atty. Gen., Montgomery, Ala., for defendants-appellees.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.
Before GOLDBERG, RONEY and TJOFLAT, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM.


1
Robert L. Rudolph is a state prisoner in Alabama.  According to his complaint, he is voluntarily confined in a segregation unit because of threats to his life.  An Alabama prison regulation provides that ""absolutely nothing will be allowed to go from one inmate to another in the Segregation Units.""  R. at 8. Rudolph brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that the regulation violated his first amendment rights and his right of access to the courts.  On the basis of the complaint, the answer, some motion papers, and an affidavit from Rudolph, the district court denied relief.  Rudolph appeals.  We reverse and remand the case so that further evidence may be taken.


2
A prisoner ""retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.""  Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).  The Alabama regulation obviously limits Rudolph's ability to send literature about politics and religion to other prisoners and to receive such material from them.  Therefore Alabama must show how applying its sweeping regulation to prisoners like Rudolph furthers its legitimate penological objectives.  Alabama's bare assertion that the regulation ""is an appropriate means of maintaining... security in the segregation units,"" R. at 9"

158,1,1668,"""This is not you, Basil, this is not you.""

Those were the last words of 66-year-old Carol Culleton before she was strangled with a television cable at her cottage near Combermere, Ont., according to her accused murderer, Basil Borutski.

His chilling interview with Ontario Provincial Police Det. Sgt. Caley O'Neill — recorded the day after the killings of Culleton, Anastasia Kuzyk, 36, and Nathalie Warmderdam, 48, on Sept. 22, 2015, at three separate locations in and around Wilno, Ont. — was played for the jury in an otherwise silent Ontario courtroom in Ottawa Friday.

Court has heard that Borutski knew all three victims. He had been in previous relationships with Warmerdam and Kuzyk, and was convicted of offences against Warmerdam and Kuzyk in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

Near the end of the hours-long interview the day after the killings, Borutski tells police he hasn't slept in days and that he's been trying to get help on a crisis line and through a probation officer. He says that he felt like his ""head was going to blow off"" and that ""everything was just snapping in my head,"" but that he ""got nothing.""

Accused felt God was on his side

He tells O'Neill that the night before the killings, he spoke to an older woman at his building about the Bible and about the difference between killing and murder.

""Murdering is killing something innocent,"" he says in the interview. If the Bible said thou shalt not kill, people wouldn't be allowed to kill animals for food or for sport, he says.

Later, he talks about what happened on Sept. 22, 2015, saying he felt like God was on his side and telling him where to go, like he was in danger, like he could see everything happening as if he were watching through a camera or walking beside himself, and that the man he was watching was like a zombie.

""I killed them because they were not innocent. They were guilty. I was innocent. I had done nothing wrong in God's eyes,"" he tells O'Neill.

'You're lying to me again'

It started at Culleton's cottage.

""And I remember thinking that God is really helping me, because when I went to Carol's, Carol walked right outside. And then I asked her, I said, 'Why do you hate me, why are you doing this to me?'"" Borutski tells O'Neill in hushed tones, his elbows on the table, his head in both his hands.

159,28,4234," pattern associated with interoception, including the (posterior) insula. Whether interoception is related to Ultimatum Game behavior was more directly examined by [@B12]. In their study, [@B12] demonstrated that as interoceptive abilities increase, people reported more anger in response to unfair offers and found these offers more unfair. Moreover, those with better interoceptive ability showed a larger difference in psychophysiological arousal, i.e., skin conductance, to rejected relative to accepted offers. This difference in arousal further predicted higher rejection rates in people with better interoception, but this relationship was absent for people with poorer interoception. These data were interpreted as being consistent with emotion regulation explanations for rejection decisions in the Ultimatum Game. However, emotion regulation was not explicitly measured in the study by [@B12]. Examining whether people with better interoceptive ability are better at applying emotion regulation when confronted with unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game might provide more insight into the relationship between emotion regulation, interoception, and reactions to unfair treatment. Moreover, there is no investigation on whether interoceptive ability influences Ultimatum Game behavior when interacting with the same person for a second time (who may have been unfair the first time).

In this study, we directly wanted to test whether there is a relationship between interoceptive ability and the ability to apply emotion regulation, i.e., reappraisal, when treated unfairly by others in the Ultimatum Game. In addition, we were interested in testing whether there is a relationship between interoceptive awareness and emotion regulation ability when proposing offers to others who previously had treated them unfairly in the Ultimatum Game. In the experiment, we opted for the use of reappraisal as a regulatory strategy. During reappraisal, people actively try to rework the meaning of emotion-inducing situations, and it has been shown to be effective in lowering emotional experience and reducing the associated psychophysiological processes, such as heart rate, skin conductance responses, and neural activity ([@B18]; [@B32]; [@B20]; [@B17]). Moreover, in our previous study on regulation during the Ultimatum Game, reappraisal seemed to be most effective in influencing decision-making ([@B45]). We predicted that people who are better at (interoceptively) accessing their bodily signals would accept more unfair offers proposed by others and would be less emotionally involved during regulation as compared to baseline. This was based on the above mentioned research showing (1) the importance of interoceptive awareness for successful emotion regulation ([@B15]), and (2) that those who typically are better regulators, i.e., meditators, accept more unfair offers and show neural patterns indicative of interoception ([@B25]). Our hypotheses with respect to an association between interoceptive awareness and proposal behavior in the Ultimatum Game while applying emotion regulation as compared to baseline were exploratory. A potential positive correlation between interoceptive awareness and proposed offers in the second round after regulating (as compared to baseline) suggests that people with better inter"

Ludwig Wilhelm Erhard (; 4 February 1897 – 5 May 1977) was a German politician affiliated with the CDU, and the second Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) from 1963 until 1966. He is often famed for leading the West German postwar economic reforms and economic recovery (Wirtschaftswunder, German for ""economic miracle"") in his role as Minister of Economic Affairs under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer from 1949 to 1963. During that period he promoted the concept of the social market economy (soziale Marktwirtschaft), on which Germany's economic policy in the 21st century continues to be based. In his tenure as Chancellor, however, Erhard lacked support from Adenauer, who remained chairman of the party until his death, and failed to win the public's confidence in his handling of a budget deficit and his direction of foreign policy. His popularity waned, and he resigned his chancellorship on 1 December 1966.

Early life and career
Ludwig Erhard was born in Fürth in the Kingdom of Bavaria on 4 February 1897. His father was Wilhelm Erhard (b. 1859), a Catholic middle class clothing store proprietor, while his mother Augusta was a Protestant. Ludwig had two brothers and a sister, Rose, all of whom were raised as Protestants. Ludwig suffered from infantile paralysis in his third year, resulting in a deformed right foot and forcing him to wear orthopedic shoes for the remainder of his life.

Erhard entered primary school in Fürth at the age of six in 1903 and performed poorly. In 1907, he entered Fürth's Royal Bavarian Vocational High School, where his grades were average. He received his secondary school certificate in 1913. He was a commercial apprentice at the Georg Eisenbach textile company in Nuremberg from 1913 to 1916. After his apprenticeship he worked as a retail salesman in his father's draper's shop.

In 1916, during World War I, Erhard volunteered for the German military. He was referred to the 22nd Royal Bavarian Artillery Regiment and trained as a gun aimer. He first served in the quiet Vosges sector on the Western Front. The regiment was then deployed to Romania on the Eastern Front, where he also saw little combat. Erhard contracted typhus and was sent back to Germany. He recovered and returned to his unit. He was badly wounded on his left shoulder, side and leg by an Allied artillery shell on 28 September 1918 during the Fifth Battle of Ypres. He was committed to a military hospital in Recklinghausen, where he underwent seven operations until June 1919. His left arm became permanently shorter than his right one.

Because of his injury he could no longer work as a draper and started learning economics in late 1919 at a business college in Nuremberg. He passed the school's exit examination on 22 March 1922 and received a degree in business administration. During his time at school, he developed a friendship with the economist and professor Wilhelm Rieger, to whom Erhard owed much of his liberal convictions. Thanks to Rieger's intervention, Erhard was able to enroll at the University of Frankfurt in fall of 1922. He received his Ph.D. from the university on 12 December 1925, for a dissertation finished in the summer of 1924 under Franz Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's liberal socialist ideology had a heavy influence on Erhard, especially Oppenheimer's opposition to monopolies. During his time in Frankfurt he married Luise Schuster (1893–1975), a fellow economist, on 11 December 1923. They had known each other since childhood.

After his graduation they moved to"

For most of the past 30 years, the leaders in patent filing were without doubt Japan and the US, with Europe bumping along in third place. But from the early 2000s, China began to emerge as a significant force, and each year since 2011 more patent applications have been filed in China than in any other intellectual property office around the globe.

The initial rush was for domestically filed patents, but Chinese companies soon began looking for international markets, with the latest data from the European Patent Office (EPO) putting China fourth in the volume of patents filed in the EU last year, up from 12th less than a decade ago."

171,2,15270," and their role in organizational decision making. I use this integration to suggest that boards with particular characteristics may have interests that do not align with those of the management team when performance shortfalls occur, using their influence to force compromises or compel managers to reconsider particular changes. I find support for the related predictions that an increase in board size and equity ownership suppresses change when performance drops, although I find no support for similar arguments regarding board turnover. This approach blends the typically distinct but related literatures on performance feedback and corporate governance, and suggests the role that some boards might play in circumventing the momentum for organizational change.

Failures are difficult to learn from, and organizations unable to learn may continue to fail. This study reconciles conflicting theoretical predictions regarding whether organizations are able to learn from failure, by examining the moderating role of knowledge gained through an organization’s operating experience. The study also forwards the possibility that generalist and specialist organizations systematically differ at this process. Hypotheses are tested on a panel of railroad companies. These tests provide strong support for the role of operating experience, and partial support for differences across generalists and specialists. Contributions to organizational learning theory and related literatures are discussed.

Why do organizations vary in complying with regulatory mandates? While some may resist these pressures, what to change or how to change it may be unclear even when managers do intend to fully comply. Though scarce in the literature, theories regarding how organizations search for and learn from information under uncertainty provide an ideal window through which to examine organizational responses to regulatory mandates and other external pressures. In this study, I adapt these theories to posit that organizations …[Full Text]

While research has suggested that organizations can improve by investigating and learning from failures, some work has found that they may generate incorrect lessons or fail to learn. This study addresses the debate by turning attention to the processes that underlie learning, using attribution theory to highlight the way in which decision makers interpret information about where failures occurred or who was involved. This approach is notable because it suggests that different organizations with similar experiences may have quite distinct reactions based on where that experience originates. Specifically, I predict that organizations learn less effectively when their failures are relatively concentrated in origin, meaning that failures typically involve a particular unit or even a specific individual, compared to when failures are more broadly dispersed. I also examine factors that intensify or ameliorate this effect, including an organization’s size or its performance relative to aspirations. I test related hypotheses on a panel of hospitals that offered a specific surgical procedure within California from 2003 through 2010.

Two perspectives predict how organizational performance influences illegal action. First, poor performance creates tension, leading decision makers to repair the gap through any means necessary. However, strong performance also bolsters risky behavior, possibly leading to violations. To integrate these perspectives, I suggest that performance evaluation provides only the motive to commit illegal action and that decision makers also require an opportunity to do so. I extend"

How do you transparently pass arguments through to a function in python?

Specifically, when you have one function that calls another function, but the signature of the second function is unknown.
I know you can use *args and **kwargs for something similar to this, but I can't seem to get it quite right in a way that always works. 
So for example, something like this almost works:
class Invoker():
  def __init__(self, call):
    self._call = call
  def call(self, *args, **kwargs):
    self._call(*args, **kwargs)

..but if I write some tests for it I get this output:
1 -> 2  ('Hello')
1 -> 2  ((3, 'Hello'))
1 -> 2  ('Hello'), ({'left': 'right'})
1 -> 2  ((3,)), ({'value': 'Hello'})
call5() got multiple values for keyword argument 'value'
call5() got multiple values for keyword argument 'value'

from this code:
# Known argument list: works fine
def call(x, y, value=None):
  print(""%d -> %d  (%r)"" % (x, y, value))

invoker = Invoker(call)
invoker.call(1, 2, value=""Hello"")

# Unknown argument list with no kwargs: works fine
def call2(x, y, *args):
  print(""%d -> %d  (%r)"" % (x, y, args))

invoker = Invoker(call2)
invoker.call(1, 2, 3, ""Hello"")

# Unknown kwargs with default value: works fine
def call3(x, y, value=None, **kwargs):
  print(""%d -> %d  (%r), (%r)"" % (x, y, value, kwargs))

invoker = Invoker(call3)
invoker.call(1, 2, value=""Hello"", left=""right"")

# Unknown args and kwargs: works fine
def call4(x, y, *args, **kwargs):
  print(""%d -> %d  (%r), (%r)"" % (x, y, args, kwargs))

invoker = Invoker(call4)

In spite of the fact that, the women who has given birth once before and have received auto hypnosis trainings, would experience considerably shorter stage one labor in comparison with control group. At the end they proposed that auto hypnosis method would reduce the application of painkiller and also could reduce the labor length especially in women who were pregnant for the first time.^[@ref14]^ Martin et al. investigated the effects of hypnosis on the labor processes and birth outcomes of pregnant adolescents.^[@ref15]^ During their study, the women in group of hypnosis experienced adequate four-session training which included posthypnotic proposal for an ordinary delivery and labor, confidence and comfort feelings, an enhanced control sense, the women capability for entering hypnosis condition again and also experiencing pleasurable imagination of hypnosis pending a grievous constriction. Anyway, the group of hypnosis did not experience auto hypnosis courses and also direct intervention was not made during delivery and labor. The intervention of hypnosis was presented via family and marriage therapist. The control group experienced supportive psychotherapic counseling that could provide the opportunity of discuss concern issues which are associated with childbirth for patients.

186,2,7778,"The present invention relates to a dot recording device, such as a serial printer, and more particularly, to a dot recording device including a record medium regulating part and dot recording head in opposed facing relationship, the dot recording device for recording on a record medium that is carried on the record medium regulating part.
With printers, such as serial printers, that have a dot recording head formed to scan a printing medium (e.g., the surface of a paper sheet) along a raster, the recording head is provided with a dot formation element array made up of multiple dot formation elements arrayed in a sub scanning direction on the head surface. Multiple scanning lines of the same color can be simultaneously printed by the dot formation element array with one pass along the main scanning path. As used herein, recording, and derivatives thereof, indicate printing, and derivatives thereof.
In a printer using such a recording head, particularly an ink-jet printer, differences in characteristics of individual ink-jet nozzles (an ink-jet nozzle is equivalent to the dot formation element discussed above) and differences in pitch between ink-jet nozzles are obstacles to realizing printing of high quality images.
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,198,642 and 5,844,585 disclose a printing method referred to as ""interlace recording"" in which printing of high quality images is enabled by dispersing variations in the characteristics and pitch of ink-jet nozzles on a printed image.
With interlace recording, a recording head is provided with a nozzle array in which N number of ink-jet nozzles are arrayed in a sub scanning direction at a nozzle pitch k equivalent to k times the dot pitch (k-dot pitch). Nozzle pitch is a function of recording (printing) resolution, which can be measured in dpi. For N number of nozzles, the nozzle pitch k is N or an integer smaller than N. Every time the nozzle array finishes one main scanning path, the print medium is advanced (i.e., sub scanning) a fixed distance equivalent to N times the dot pitch (N-dot pitch).
An illustrative example of the interlace recording method is described below. It is assumed that a nozzle array is provided with 20 (N=20) nozzles arranged at 3-dot pitch (k) to generate an image resolution of 360 dpi. Thus, the one-dot pitch is equivalent to 1/360 inch, with the pitch between nozzles being 3/360 inches--the equivalent of 3 (k) times the one-dot pitch."

Napoleon at War - Battle of Los Alcazarez

This month at our club meeting we had three games going covering WWII FOW version 3, an ACW game and our initial go at Napoleon at War, a new set of rules and a range of figures from the guys at Man at War.﻿

In addition to describing our game I thought I would include my impressions. I should add that I am not an expert player of Napoleon at War, only having played two games, but I have played a lot of Napoleonics in thirty nine years of wargaming.

I will also point out that I have based my figures to this rule set, a collection of mainly AB's and Fantassin figures, but the guys at Man at War are producing their own ranges all prepacked with the bases to build the required brigades, and there is soon to be the launch of their first campaign book covering Waterloo and the 100 days.

For our test game I ran the fictional battle of Los Alcazarez which is a ""Rear Guard"" mission. The mission essentially requires the defenders to hold their ground for 6 turns by controlling or disputing possession of two centrally placed objectives, I used a couple of waggon models, and gaining more victory points vs the attacker by exhausting enemy forces. The forces tend to be brigades of three to four infantry battalions, two or three"

# Chapter Three

NOON came and went. Andy only peeked up from his pillow to catch the sun blazing through his window. Grumbles rippled up through his throat as he buried his head back in the plush, silken mound at the side of his face. Reaching back, he blindly pulled the covers over his head, and when he heard Lupita excitedly calling his name—""Meester Andy! Meester Andy!""—he groaned.

""I'm sleeping, Lupita,"" he growled, but the pillow suffocating his face muffled his voice.

She banged her dainty fist against the locked bedroom door. ""Meester Andy, your papa, he want to see you. He say wake you up.""

Now what in the hell could he possibly want? Senior and Junior made good practice of staying far the hell away from each other, and Daddy wanted to change the rules all of a sudden? The nerve!

""Tell him I'll be up to see him after he gets his head out of his ass,"" Andy called back.

""Meester Andy?"" Lupita had an obvious hesitation in her voice, a certain wariness everyone who dealt with Anderson Hartley Sr. had.

""I'm kidding,"" Andy drawled as he rolled over on the bed, dragging the covers down his bare, tattooed torso. He scrubbed his hand over the memorial piece over his heart for his mother—a cross, with a large white lily blossoming out around it. Her name was drawn in cursive just beneath it—Donna Madison Hartley. They shared a middle name.

God, he missed her. She'd always played mediator between him and his father, probably kept them from killing each other on more than one occasion. If she were alive, his father wouldn't be calling his name right now.

""I'll be right there,"" he finally said, dragging his tired ass out of bed.

The five hours of sleep he'd had felt more like two. It was probably the most restless sleep he'd had since he'd finally accepted his mother being gone for good. All the psyching himself up to face her death those last few months she'd had to live in the hospital didn't work. When she'd taken her last breath, part of him died with her. The part, he assumed, that let him love or let anyone get too close.

Andy padded across the room, completely naked, stomping over the thousand-dollar pile of fabric on his floor, and went straight over to his dresser. He fished out a pair of blood-red silk sleep pants, then reached for his black robe. He tightened it around his body well, careful to cover the tattoos trailing down his arms and chest so his father wouldn't see them. Daddy Hartley"
190,9,28573," opening up a major hole between the quantity of taxes paid by Amazon and that of companies and people particularly. common.

In some instances, cities have proposed utilizing their location to take advantage of current rules. The ""Think about the Potentialities"" providing part of Las Vegas, has put ahead a variety of ethically questionable proposals, shifting some non-HQ2 actions from Amazon, such because the switch of pilots from # 39; aircraft Amazon (PrimeAir) their operations in Kentucky, to ""scale back labor prices."" by avoiding the non-public revenue tax of Kentucky. Equally, Kankakee County, Illinois, has advised progressive maneuvers to benefit from the incentives supplied by the ""deduction of curiosity earned from monetary establishments"". The county bid advised that Amazon ""incorporate a financial institution"" to regulate its land with a view to benefit from an incentive for monetary establishments.

The Chicago proposal made waves with a high-quality video presentation accompanied by a voice-over of William Shatner. However Chicago's candidacy, stored secret till the town was eradicated, was basically a advertising discuss in regards to the metropolis's values ​​and a set of incentives that exploited current packages. The only merchandise was an argument in favor of an infrastructure improve of $ 400 million, though the small print are unclear.

four. Cities are accustomed to competitors and to not collaboration.

Within the RFP, Amazon requested an software from every metropolitan space, hoping to encourage regionalism. Though there have been a small variety of regional presents, regional collaboration has been very weak. In Metro Larger Washington, the northern suburbs of Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia have all submitted separate bids. Within the Dallas space, municipalities have supplied competing incentives, together with providing completely different incentives to the state of Texas. Even within the profitable bid in New York, Staten Island had an odd caught part that appeared extra like a cut-and-paste addition than a homogeneous regional tuning fork.

In some instances, what appeared like regional collaboration has failed. St. Louis has developed a proposal with Illinois, offering particulars on websites situated on either side of the Mississippi River. Regardless of the creation of a HQ2 campus in two states and on either side of Mississippi, the small print of the motivation within the bid indicated that any funding could be made in Missouri or in Illinois.

Just a few distinctive cities provide sincere collaborations. In Virginia, the three city-state proposals (Northern Virginia, Larger Richmond, and Hampton Roads) had very comparable buildings (together with the desk of contents) that offered clear proof of coordination. Letters of help got here not solely from native governments and public colleges, but in addition from Democratic and Republican candidates for governor of 2017. Toronto's bid, which included help from the province, in addition to letters of help mayors of potential locations, was essentially the most spectacular.

5. This isn’t everybody who performed the sport.

Many cities claimed that they might be at an obstacle by publishing their proposal for QG2, and a few even claimed that they might not publish it due to non-disclosure agreements with Amazon.

Actually, any non-disclosure settlement reached with Amazon comes after the primary spherical, and a few cities instantly launch their proposals, together with Boston and Toronto, two finalists.

The opposite cities didn’t oversell their communities. Most cities have completed their finest to indicate what is true of their communities, however some choices have tried to show the inconvenience right into a compelling argument. Las Vegas started with a commentary on current shootings and the way their group is making an attempt to come back collectively within the face of this tragedy. Detroit and Newark have mobilized Amazon's energy to assist revitalize their struggling economies. The Baltimore proposal was partially designed to provide Amazon the chance to rework a group aligned with society's values ​​of variety. Truthfully, these arguments have been highlighted and, in some ways, have been a compelling argument.

194,28,1627,"This special issue focuses on aging in place in late life. Aging in place is about being able to continue living in one\'s own home or neighborhood and to adapt to changing needs and conditions. It is of high concern due to the increasing number of old and very old people in all societies and challenges researchers, practitioners, and policy makers in many societal and scientific areas and disciplines. We invited authors to contribute original research papers as well as conceptually driven review papers that would stimulate the continuing efforts to understand the different aspects of aging in place in late life. The papers that were submitted came from very diverse disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, occupational therapy, nursing, architecture, public planning, and social work. Given the number and diversity of papers submitted, we can conclude that aging in place is an important concern throughout the world and that different kinds of measures are taken to come up with local, national, and international solutions that enhance aging in place. It remains a very complex issue that needs and deserves to be investigated from many different perspectives and assessed by means of different methodological origin, covering qualitative and quantitative measures, as well as mixed-method approaches. Subsequently, the selection of papers presented in this issue only sheds light on some aspects of sociophysical person-environment exchange as people age, contributing to the ongoing discussion in the field of environmental gerontology.

Vasunilashorn et al. present a review study targeting the concept of aging in place as a research topic whose time has come. They found an increasing proportion of scientific papers over time, in particular those focusing on policy matters and the use of technology to support ageing in place. They concluded that aging in place is far from a one-size-fits-all issue but rather something that differs across populations due to, for example, culture, demographic, and legal systems.

The perspectives of the older persons themselves on social relationships and connectedness, social exclusion and inclusion, and the impact of the neighborhood were targeted in the following studies. By way of qualitative interviews, in the study by Emlet et al., older people were asked about their perception of social connectedness, how the society can help with life transitions to support aging in place, and what kinds of difficulties that they perceived in the home and neighborhood. However, different in conceptual framing and method, similar topics were emphasized by Yen et al., as well as Burns et al. The studies revealed that older people staying in the same neighborhood may experience strangeness, social exclusion, economic exclusion and insecurity due to gentrification and had few positive social ties in the neighborhood. They had a strong drive to stay active and to have meaningful social interactions with others, and they also wanted to contribute to the society. However, they experienced considerable structural barriers, for example, access to transportation services and other services in the neighborhood that made it difficult to stay active and connected to the society.

Neoliberalism

Neoliberalism seeks to update liberalism by accepting the neorealist presumption that states are the key actors in international relations, but still maintains that non-state actors (NSAs) and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) matter. Proponents argue that states will cooperate irrespective of relative gains, and are thus concerned with absolute gains. This also means that nations are, in essence, free to make their own choices as to how they will go about conducting policy without any international organizations blocking a nation's right to sovereignty. Neoliberal institutionalism, an approach founded by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, emphasize the important role of international institutions in maintaining an open global trading regime.

Prominent neoliberal institutionalists are John Ikenberry, Robert Keohane, and Joseph Nye.

Regime theory is derived from the liberal tradition that argues that international institutions or regimes affect the behaviour of states (or other international actors). It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of"
198,10,13031,"US wants to hack your phone because it doesn’t have real spies it needs

As Google’s Android smartphone operating system was coming under attack in fall 2012 from malware with the colorful names of “Loozfon” and “FinFisher,” the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center issued an alert to help defend against the threat. “Depending on the type of phone,” the FBI said, “the operating system may have encryption available. This can be used to protect the user’s personal data.”

How times have changed.

Last fall, when Apple and Google announced they were cleaning up their operating systems to ensure that their users’ information was encrypted to prevent hacking and potential data loss, FBI Director James Comey attacked both companies. He claimed the encryption would cause the users to “place themselves above the law.”

The tech community fired back. “The only actions that have undermined the rule of law,” Ken Gude wrote in Wired, “are the government’s deceptive and secret mass-surveillance programs.”

The battle resumed in February 2015. Michael Steinbach, FBI assistant director for counterterrorism, said it is “irresponsible” for companies like Google and Apple to use software that denies the FBI lawful means to intercept data.

Yet the FBI does have a lawful means to intercept it: the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Its scope was vastly expanded by Congress in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

It’s worth noting that the FBI never asked Congress to force tech companies to build “back doors” into their products immediately after the 9/11 attacks. Only after Google and Apple took steps to patch existing security vulnerabilities did the bureau suddenly express concern that terrorists might be exploiting this encryption.

In fact, the bureau has a host of legal authorities and technological capabilities at its disposal to intercept and read communications, or even to penetrate facilities or homes to implant audio and video recording devices. The larger problem confronting the FBI and the entire U.S. intelligence community is their over-reliance on electronic technical collection against terrorist targets.

The best way to disrupt any organized criminal element is to get inside of it physically. But the U.S. government’s counterterrorism policies have made that next to impossible.

The FBI, for example, targets the very Arab-American and Muslim-American communities it needs to work with if it hopes to find and neutralize home-grown violent extremists, including promulgating new rules on profiling that allow for the potential mapping of Arab- or Muslim-American communities. The Justice Department’s refusal to investigate the New York Police Department’s mass surveillance and questionable informant-recruitment tactics among immigrants in the Arab- and Muslim-American communities has only made matters worse.

Overseas, the Cold War style of spying — relying on U.S. embassies as bases from which CIA and other U.S. government intelligence personnel operate — is increasingly difficult in the areas of the Middle East and southwest Asia undergoing often violent political change.

Steinbach testified about this before the House Homeland Security Committee earlier this month. “The concern is in Syria,” he explained, “the lack of our footprint on the ground in Syria — that the databases won’t have the information we need.”

Notice his reference to technology “databases” rather than the importance of the human element. The U.S. intelligence community’s emphasis should be on the spy on the ground who actually gathers critical information and makes any penetration of a terrorist organization possible.

This problem is true for Yemen as well, as a recent Washington Poststory highlighted:

The spy agency has pulled dozens of operatives, analysts and other staffers from Yemen as part of a broader extraction of roughly 200 Americans who had been based at the embassy in Sana, officials said. Among those removed were senior officers who worked closely with Yemen’s intelligence and security services to target al-Qaeda operatives and disrupt terrorism plots often aimed at the United States.

The CIA’s failure to field agents under nonofficial cover, or to recruit enough reliable local informants on the ground who could communicate securely with CIA handlers outside Yemen, is symptomatic of the agency’s failure to break with its reliance on embassy-based operations throughout that part of the world. Compromising encryption technology will do nothing to solve the intelligence community’s human-intelligence deficit. This is a problem the agency must address if it is ever going to be successful in finding and neutralizing terrorist cells overseas.

It boils down to the fact that the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community have failed to adapt their intelligence-collection practices and"

The first day of the event was filled with a variety of different workshops and discussions regarding the NFT token standard and Tezos ecosystem. Serghei Vasylchuk, the CEO of the Everstake, gave an opening speech at the very beginning of the event, motivating all participants to be creative and persistent when inventing new products. The hackathon was organized by such companies as Everstake, Bake’n’Rolls, and sponsored by TQTezos and Tezos Commons.

All participating teams were assisted by mentors from Attic Lab, Stove Labs, Baking Bad, and Heatherglade who expressed deep commitment helping in complex technical problems during the event. Mentors from Stove Labs Matej Sima and Istvan Deak have made an introduction into such tools as LIGO, Granary and Stove Labs SDK. And mentors from Baking Bad have presented the PyTezos Library and a useful tool called Better Call Dev Smart Contract Explorer.

This set of tools has significantly helped teams in development process, allowing them to reach their goals during the hackathon. By the end of the first day, participants were discussing the Tezos Technology and networking with each other until the late evening.

Day 2 — First Problems, And First MVPs

In the morning of the second day, participants have successfully formed 15 teams, and later on, they have presented ideas and ways how they are planning to implement them using Tezos technology. It was incredible to see how teams were coming up with entirely different products they wanted to create, and almost all of them presented value for Tezos ecosystem. All participants were given 24 hours to develop their solutions and present them on the third day to the jury.

Mentors from all companies have significantly helped teams on the event with technical issues that they were stumbling upon. By the end of the second day, some teams were able to finish working on their MVPs, and for the rest of the evening, they prepared presentations.

Day 3 — The Final Challenge

It can be definitely said that the last day of the hackathon was the most intensive in terms of preparations and development. Teams had only a few hours since the morning to finish their solutions and start pitching their products to the audience. At the same time on 3 PM EET, the Everstake and Bake’n’Rolls social media teams have launched the poll to define the winner of the Audience Choice Award based on the projects descriptions and their actual products. Eventually, the Blaize team has presented a multi-functional platform for NFT tokens exchange and was able to take the Audience Choice Award, winning a $1,000 in the end.

202,19,10311,"Moy House, Forres

Moy House is an 18th-century country house near Forres in Moray, Scotland. Built on the site of an older house by Collen Williamson and John Adam in the mid eighteenth century for Sir Ludovic Grant of Grant, it was the first building designed by a member of the Adam family to be built in Moray.  It was designated a Category A listed building in 1971, and has been listed on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland since 1990; ravaged by fire in 1995, it is now a ruin.

Description
Moy House is a ruined mansion, built in the classical style. Its three-storey central block, which is now roofless, has two main facades, one facing east and the other west, with its principal entrance in the east front. Three-storey wings project to the east at either end of the main block, forming a U-shaped courtyard, and two-storey wings projecting beyond these to the north and south. 

The building is not inhabited, and has remained in a ruinous state since a fire in 1995. Its dilapidation has been described by Walker and Woodworth as ""one of the greatest architectural losses in Moray"".

East elevation
The house's principal entrance is in the east facade. Prior to the bridging of the Findhorn, visitors would have approach the house from the east, following the road from the Findhorn Ferry; the bridge's construction around 1799 allowed carriages to approach the house from the west. The symmetrical frontage, described by Walker and Woodworth as ""almost uncompromisingly severe"", has five bays, and a round-headed central door surmounted by a corniced doorpiece and flanked by narrow ionic columns. Above the door is an enlarged window, which may have been designed to accommodate a balcony, but this is no longer present.

Post-Stonewall History

Photo from Wiki Commons Herstory Archives

Stonewall had immediate repercussions in the movement. Soon after, a group of gay activists formed the Gay Liberation Front, which was of a piece with the radical liberation activism of the day and made alliances with other left movements, including the Black Panthers and the Young Lords. Its members were confrontational and unapologetic, and their intense group splintered and ultimately burned out in April 1971. (Some veterans of the group are having a reunion panel on June 25 at 6 p.m. at the LGBT Community Center, which I'll be moderating.)

The Gay Activists Alliance broke with the front to focus on single-issue gay activism in 1970. The alliance lasted about 10 years, spawning splinters of its own such as Lesbian Feminist Liberation, part of a lesbian separatist movement.

On the first anniversary of Stonewall -- in June 1970 -- New York City saw the world's first big gay march. Craig Rodwell played a key role just by posting a sign in the window of his gay bookstore calling on people to mark the first anniversary of the rebellion, but he was aided by both Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance.

The Legislative Battles

During the 1960s, states around the country began repealing anti-sodomy laws as part of the effort to rid legal codes of archaic laws. New York's legislature, however, would not act on repeal despite the urgings of a young member of the State Assembly named Ed Koch. The New York Court of Appeals ruled the state law was unconstitutional in 1980. It took until 2003 for the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the nation's 13 remaining state sodomy laws.

New York City was the first municipality in the world to propose amending its human rights law to ban discrimination on the basis of ""sexual orientation,"" a legal phrase coined by the Gay Activists Alliance in 1971. The City Council, though, refused to pass the law for years, while many other major U.S. cities moved ahead and passed gay rights bills. New York did not join them until 1986.

Village Assemblymember Bill Passanante introduced New York State's gay rights bill -- the first such state bill in the nation -- in 1971, but that didn't pass until 2002, long after states such as Wisconsin led the way in offering statewide protections in 1985. New York State still has not added protections on the basis of gender identity and expression covering people of transgender experience, but the city did in 2002.

New York State's hate crimes law was held up by a Republican-controlled Senate until 2000 -- more than 13 years after it was first proposed following the Howard Beach racial killing in 1986. The sticking point was including ""sexual orientation."" Most states had passed hate crimes laws in"

People with an internet enabled device can access yahoo.com (yahoo is a trademark of Yahoo corporation) and other internet connected resources. There are also Global Positioning System (GPS) devices that enable mobile users to know exactly where they are on a particular map. Users with GPS device functionality can further manually enter their known location into an internet MAP directory service (e.g. yahoo.com Maps) and then provide a target address they want to go to. Step by step instructions are then provided to the user for how to get to the destination from the current location. Some GPS devices provide local processing for directing, and narrating to, a driver. Mating automated location finding systems with internet travel direction services is an attractive blend.
Cadillac recently announced the OnStar program with sales of Cadillac automobiles (Cadillac and OnStar are trademarks of General Motors corporation). A person is enabled with calling upon an “OnStar Advisor” 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, with the press of a button. An emergency call, for example 911, or for a disabled Cadillac vehicle, allows a driver to instantly call upon wireless connected assistance. The driver may also call upon the OnStar Advisor for directions to a destination. The Advisor has access to automatic processing for determination of the vehicle's current location in case of auto theft, a disabled vehicle, or assisting with directions. The Advisor can also remotely unlock the vehicle should the driver lock the keys in the car. In effect, Cadillac drivers have full time wireless connected assistance around the clock for many reasons. While the location determination of the vehicle is automatic, there remain manual processes performed by the Advisor. Automation of some of these processes is desirable.
Many internet services derive their revenue stream from advertising. Advertisers pay to have their content delivered to users who access website and web server interfaces. Advertisers desire to target their audience at the most appropriate time. Knowing the location of a user as being relevant to a particular advertisement is desirable. Automating the delivery of the content is desirable.
A method is needed for a low cost business model that enables the efficient configuration of deliverable content for automatic delivery to mobile users based on their situational location that is relevant to receive such content.
To make such services attractive to consumers, quality deliverable content is needed, an environment promoting anonymous use is desirable, and additional complementary location based services will enhance the experience and entice consumers to use services. Consumers are concerned with privacy so location based services should be sensitive to privacy concerns. A model providing private and anonymous location based services without limitation of functionality is desirable.
Two companies, uLocate.com and dodgeball.com, have developed internet accessed websites for making use of user location information (uLocate.com and dodgeball.com are respective trademarks of the website companies). The uLocate.com website lacks full automation, automated registration, privilege assignments, different user types, and does not contain the many other features disclosed below in this application. The dodgeball.com website does not leverage automatic location capability using GPS or triangulation. Text messages have to be manually entered for features and functionality of the website. A globally accessed website is needed that integrates a better mode of such classes of websites using automated features, along with many new features not offered by the websites to provide an enhanced set of location based services.
Different users use different types of devices: laptops, tablet PCs, PDAs, cell phones, etc. An automated website that supports location enhanced services for heterogeneous devices is needed. This should include any mobile device capable of communicating with a web service. Automated account registration, automated billing, and high performance support for mass numbers of users is desirable. Automated deletion of obsolete accounts and data is also desirable. Eliminating the use of (or at least minimizing) human resource operations is reasonable.

Although the mean preoperative JOA score in complete-type patients tended to be lower than that in the other types, this difference did not reach statistical significance (10.4 vs. 8.8 vs. 6.5 for superior-, inferior- and complete-type, respectively; *P* = 0.08). The neurological recovery rate was similar in all the three types (superior-: 71%, inferior-: 69% and complete-type: 70%, *P* = 0.98) ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}).

[Table 2](#T2){ref-type=""table""} shows the comparison of radiological data and postoperative complications between the three fracture types. Twenty-two patients (58%) demonstrated spondylolisthesis in the damaged motion segments, which was due to a higher rate of superior- or inferior-type (19/27; 70%) burst fractures localized in the upper or lower half of the vertebra than in the complete-type (3/11; 27%, *P* = 0.028).

210,13,5878,"The present invention relates to a novel positive-working photoresist composition or, more particularly, to a high-sensitivity positive-working photoresist composition capable of giving a finely patterned resist layer in a high resolution and excellent in the cross sectional profile of the patterned layer and heat resistance with excellent characteristics of focusing depth latitude and exposure dose latitude even on a surface having ruggedness or level differences and high reflectivity as well as good halation-preventing effect.
As is known, the method of photolithographic patterning is a well established technology in the process for the manufacture of semiconductor devices such as ICs, LSIs and the like and liquid-crystal devices such as liquid-crystal display panels and the like. The photolithographic patterning work is conducted by first forming a layer of a so-called photoresist composition which is pattern-wise exposed to actinic rays such as ultraviolet light to form a latent image of the pattern followed by development. Of the two types of photoresist compositions including positive-working and negative-working ones, the positive-working photoresist compositions are preferred in most cases to the negative-working ones and the essential ingredients in a typical positive-working photoresist composition under practical use include an alkali-soluble resin as a film-forming ingredient and a quinone diazide group-containing compound as a photosensitizing ingredient.
The alkali-soluble resin as a film-forming ingredient in a positive-working photoresist composition most widely used in practical applications is a novolac resin in respect of the advantageous properties thereof that the resin is soluble in an alkaline aqueous solution as a developer solution without swelling to exhibit excellent developability and the resist layer formed therefrom has excellent heat resistance to withstand plasma etching with the patterned resist layer as an etching mask.
The quinone diazide group-containing compound as the photosensitive ingredient is very unique because the compound in itself has an activity to suppress the alkali-solubility of the novolac resin while, when irradiated pattern-wise with actinic rays including electromagnetic waves such as ultra-violet light, e.g., g-line and i-line, and far-ultraviolet light, e.g., excimer laser beams, and corpuscular rays for pattern-wise scanning such as electron beams, the quinone diazide group-containing compound per se is converted into an alkali-soluble form along with promotion of the alkali-solubility of the novolac resin. Thus, a great number of positive-working photoresist compositions comprising a quinone diazide group-containing compound and an alkali-soluble novolac resin and capable of exhibiting a great change in the properties by exposure to actinic rays such as electromagnetic waves and corpuscular rays have been developed and brought under practical applications (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,377,631, Japanese Patent Kokai No. 62-35349, Japanese Patent Kokai No. 1-142548, Japanese Patent Kokai No. 1-179147 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-4897).
Along with the increase year by year in the degree of integration in the semiconductor devices and liquid crystal devices in recent years, the accuracy required in the photo-lithographic patterning work is so fine as to be in the order of submicrons, half microns or even finer in the manufacture of, for example, VLSIs. Accordingly, the positive-working photoresist composition used therefor must satisfy several requirements that the composition can give a patterned resist layer having high resolution of the patterned images and excellent heat resistance not to cause thermal deformation in the dry etching or the post-exposure baking, i.e. heat treatment after exposure to actinic rays and before development, and that the sensitivity thereof is high in respect of the productivity along with an excellent focusing depth latitude and exposure dose latitude so as to facilitate reproduction of the resist pattern with high fidelity to the mask pattern without being affected by a level difference on the substrate surface as well as insusceptibility to halation.
As a means to accomplish the above mentioned various requirements"

220,26,19972,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes held a press conference today before announcing he was running off to the White House to tell the President what he learned. Here is the story from Politico:

Nunes said the monitoring appeared to be done legally as a result of what’s called “incidental collection,” but said he was concerned because it was not related to the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and was widely disseminated across the intelligence community. “I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored,” Nunes told reporters. “It looks to me like it was all legally collected, but it was essentially a lot of information on the president-elect and his transition team and what they were doing.” Nunes described the surveillance as most likely being “incidental collection.” This can occur when a person inside the United States communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be kept secret — but can be “unmasked” by intelligence officials under certain circumstances.

Nunes created a firestorm with this information because it led to all manner of speculation and incorrect information being bandied about on social media. Nothing helpful came from what he did, despite protests to the contrary. In the end, it looks like nothing more than Nunes giving cover to the Trump administration after the hearings on Monday went very badly for them.

In that vein, here are four reasons why this little stunt by Nunes just created an even bigger mess than before.

1. There was no purpose for releasing the information in question – Nunes said it was all “legally collected.” But he also notes there was information in the reports about the transition team. Do you know who was on Trump’s transition team? Devin Nunes. Also, he held the press conference and provided the information he received without giving it to fellow members of the Intelligence Committee. That comes off as highly irresponsible on his part. Finally, the Intelligence Committee is an oversight committee. The intelligence community is headed up by the executive branch of government and yet here was the Chairman of the committee that has oversight over the executive branch, skipping off to the White House to inform the President of information he had before other members of the committee. Jeremy Bash, a former counsel to the Intelligence Committee, had this to say:

Ex-House Intel counsel: Nunes briefing Trump is a “breakdown in the entire oversight process,” other committee members likely “horrified” pic.twitter.com/aRn8dB3Ia6 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 22, 2017

2. Saying the Trump team was placed under surveillance, wiretapped or spied on is not correct – Words mean something and the word “incidental” is key here. Attorney Gabriel Malor said the following:

""Incidental collection"" is when communications by U.S. citizens are intercepted bc they went *to* a foreign surveillance target. — Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) March 22, 2017

224,17,20777," operating systems that collectively decided to disappear. I want to hear more about the public reaction to all the people falling in love with their operating systems; in the movie as is, this was only hinted at as background information. I wanted to have a more fully developed world, rather than this movie, which only hinted at something larger. I guess if I compare it to the likes of The Fifth Element, which had this seemingly well developed world outside of the main characters, that’s what I want out of a movie, not this.

Still, the performances did really make the movie. It just wasn’t to my taste.

This was the next in my summer reading. I think I read this as a kid, or at least I assume I did, since it’s such a classic. Like the last Moomin book I read, it’s very episodic, with each chapter often making up a whole story in itself, and only very loose continuity between the stories.

All the stories in this are ones that I’ve seen before in Moomin’s other adaptations, such as the TV show or the comic versions I read a while back (and probably reviewed on here at the time). They include the magic hobgoblin’s hat, also in the first episode of the anime, and the trip to the island of the Hattifatteners.

For me, the main humour came completely unintentionally from some of the old style language that was used. I giggled, for instance, when Snufkin or Moomintroll were described as gay and queer several times, which of course matches exactly with the fact that they often behave like an old married couple.

The book is, after all, children’s literature, so it was quite easy to read overall. I didn’t have any major complaints about it, perhaps only that I wasn’t a fan of the episodic nature of the book, or the way that conflicts would be introduced on one page and quickly resolved on the next, meaning that the book never really established any sense of suspense, or that I was never worried for the characters.

I think I want to continue and read the next book in the series, though, so this could be considered a success for that reason alone.

In August, I had the slightly crazy idea that I should take a tour of Japan by train and head off to far-flung places such as Osaka and Kanazawa. It turned out I didn’t have as much stamina for it as I’d predicted, but it was fun all the same. On the first leg of the journey, I watched this little indie movie on my phone.

Gay coming-of-age drama isn’t a description that fills me with a lot of hope anymore. I used to love them, perhaps because I was closer to the target age to enjoy them, but now I get tired of them very quickly. This movie, set in northern Flanders near the North Sea, is about a young boy who has gay feelings for his best friend, who he sometimes fools around with. All the usual tropes are there: there is a lot of angst and miscommunication, especially since the protagonist is mostly silent and communicates mostly by longing stares.

The visual style of the movie is quite unique, with an almost cartoonish sensibility, and it is unclear what decade it’s supposed to be set in, what with the consistent retro aesthetic.

But basically, it’s now gotten to the point that I watch movies like this and can’t identify with them anymore. Maybe it’s just that I’m too old for it, maybe it’s that I never had such a strong crush on someone during my teens that I literally made a shrine to them, or maybe even it’s the fact that my teens were not a time of sexual discovery – that’s been relegated to my 20s, I suppose, but even then, I find the stories about unrequited love and straight boys fooling around with each other to be trite.

The Ring I Made To Remember My Father By

My dad wasn’t big on jewelry. I don’t remember him wearing a wedding ring when he was married to my mother, though, frankly, I barely remember them being married. I vaguely recall a silver band with some sort of turquoise during his second marriage, but it bent and chipped and was either lost or banished to some drawer even before that, too, ended in divorce. A Fossil watch I’d gifted him was stolen from his car. When I asked why the watch was in his car and not on his wrist, he’d shrugged and said that it’d been too flashy to wear out, so he’d never taken it out of the case.

We did, however, find a green and navy loom bracelet my nephew had once made him. He’d kept it, and as he lay dying and semi-conscious in the palliative care unit in a Santa Fe hospital last June, my sister, brother, and I put all our effort into keeping that piece of rubber close. The clasp had snapped at some point, so we could only place it in his big, warm hand, pressing it closer as we held hands with him for the first time since childhood. We were helpless when it came to handling everything else, but we could damn well make sure that bracelet stayed in his grasp, even when the nurses moved him and it got tangled up in the sheets. Once it went missing for a couple of hours, and my brother interrogated the nurses until it was discovered under Dad’s body.

My sister now keeps the bracelet in a box at her home. I have my own wearable token: a ring designed by London jeweler Rachel Boston. I met Rachel through work — basically, I stalked her online, then begged her to model holiday hairstyles for a Refinery29 article — and was a fan of her spiky, slender pieces, many of which are bespoke. A few weeks after my dad’s death, I emailed Rachel to float the idea of commissioning a ring that I could wear in honor of my dad. She responded right away, and we arranged to meet at her studio.

Modeled by Erin Donnelly.

My initial thoughts about how the ring might look were vague and filled with doubt. Dad’s initials? Something Celtic to highlight our Irish roots? All I knew was that I needed something to mark his loss. The grief was like a phantom limb, and I needed to hold it; I needed something tangible. In those days, I contemplated tattooing my skin; having a baby just to name it after my dad; building a monument, anything to have something that said “he was here.” I chose a ring because it was true to me; I’ve lost every earring and tangled every necklace I’ve ever owned, but"

During the meal in Boston, Abdullah referred to his brother in embarrassed tones only as “Mr. O.” A number of American acquaintances, including several members of the Harvard faculty, attest to the family’s distance from Osama. (The university has received from the Saudi Binladin Group donations totalling two million dollars to further Islamic scholarship there.) Abdullah said that he admires America, where he has lived periodically for the past decade, and that he abhors terrorism. He disagrees with Osama’s radical fundamentalist interpretation of the Koran; he also accepts the permanent existence of an Israeli state. “Most of my family are moderates,” he said. “We are businesspeople, that’s what we are about.”

While the Saudi government was removing the bin Laden family members from American legal jurisdiction, at home it took other precautions, two sources say. According to Saad Al-Fagih, a London-based surgeon and Saudi dissident, who heads a group called Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, Osama bin Laden’s oldest son is being closely watched by the Saudi government, which has restricted his travel from the kingdom for the past five years. Al-Fagih said that the son, Abdullah Osama bin Laden, who is in his early twenties and works for the family business, is one of some fifteen children that Osama has had with three or four wives. “He is being held as a tool,” Al-Fagih said. “He’s been imprisoned within the boundaries of Saudi Arabia. He lives with the others, but he’s kept from leaving the airport.” Al-Fagih claimed that the Saudis have “sent a message to Osama that ‘If you hurt us, we will hurt your son.’ ”

Abdel Bari Atwan, the editor of Al-Quds al-Arabi, an Arabic daily newspaper in Britain, interviewed Osama bin Laden in November, 1996, and is well acquainted with people close to bin Laden. He agreed that “the travel of Osama’s eldest son, Abdullah, is restricted,” and that he cannot leave Saudi Arabia easily. Atwan added, “Although the son works with his uncle, he has never disowned his father.”

Two weeks ago, a London-based Arabic newspaper, Asharq Al-Awsat, carried an interview with Abdullah, who confirmed that he works with the family construction company in Jidda. He spoke of his “allegiance to the Kingdom’s leadership,” but he defended his father, whom he said he had not seen for six years. He was not asked whether the government had imposed any restraints on him; he said that he had travelled to Europe as a tourist. He blamed the media for giving the world a “wrong impression” of his father. “My father is a calm and quiet person by nature,” he contended. “They have even linked the spread of anthrax to him without any proof or evidence.” With the family’s blessing, Abdullah said, he had married a relative, and now has two young children.

Cannistraro, the former C.I.A. antiterror expert, believes that many family members have cut off all contact with Osama, and revile his tactics. But there is also, he suggested, “an interconnectedness” among others in the family which frustrates and tantalizes American investigators. He told me that as recently as nine months ago an allied intelligence agency had seen two of Osama’s sisters apparently taking cash to an airport in Abu Dhabi, where they are suspected of handing it to a member of bin Laden’s Al Qaeda organization. (Tim Metz, the family spokesman, said that the intelligence report was “unfair and impossible to check without more detail.”) “Some of the sisters are very religious,” Al-Fagih said, “and they believe that even if your brother is a real criminal he is your brother. He’s got to live comfortably.” Under Shariah, Islamic law,"
227,5,7792,"For its 13th annual forecast, ACSM asked more than 2,038 fitness professionals employed by commercial gyms, medical facilities, nonprofit organizations and corporate health programs to rank 39 possible fitness trends. Among some changes and surprises, core training and circuit weight training fell out of the top 20 trends, while Pilates and online training didn’t make the top 20. Here’s a look at the top five in ACSM’s Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2019.

Wearable technology moved back to No. 1 after falling to No. 3 in 2018. “The wearables, even the low-end ones, have gotten more accurate,” says Walter R. Thompson, the 2017-2018 ACSM president and author of the report, which appeared in the November/December issue of ACSM’s Health & Fitness Journal. “That may help explain why they’re back at the top.”

Although the survey results indicate that we love to measure our outcomes, the continuing popularity of group fitness, at No. 2, suggests we don’t just want to compete against ourselves. “Some smart psychologist out there might say the millennials have access to all the technology in the world, and yet they still want to be part of a community,” says Thompson, referring to the generation the health industry is most interested in capturing.

“Group exercise is the future,” says Devin Maier, managing director of Balance Gym, a D.C.-based gym with four locations. “It definitely delivers on the community aspect, but you also have the instructor who motivates and pushes you harder.”

Also important are the accountability and acknowledgment inherent in a class of regulars, Maier says. When you do a good job, you get a shout, and when you don’t, you might hear about that, too. “If I am part of the 6:30 a.m. cycle class, I know I need to be there or they [the instructor and fellow cyclists] will give me crap next time I show up.”

Group fitness, of course, is not something new. But Maier argues that it is different from what we saw in the 1970s and ’80s with personalities such as Richard Simmons. “It’s driven by boutique studios that do one thing and they do that one thing well. It’s inspired everyone to up their game,” Maier says. “A cycling class today is much better than just a few years ago” because it incorporates more aspects of exercise, such as varying levels of intensity.

This brings us to No. 3 on the list: HIIT. This type of training is generally 30 minutes or less and incorporates short, intense intervals that can push your effort level up to 90 to 95"

Along with this concern, as many have perhaps suspected, the Israeli Defense Minister confirmed yesterday that the US has prepared plans for a ‘surgical’ military operation to delay Iran’s nuclear program.

Shadow: Lots of us read Obama’s speech and lots of us recognized it wasn’t much good. I am sure you thought it was more than it was, but once you strip away the inaccuracies and the trading of the west’s ideals to appease those who would like to destroy us you might have to concede it didn’t do much other than peddle some hopeychange snake oil. Bet the muslims aren’t buying it though.

But to answer Ms Jackson’s question: it isn’t Obama that hates women, it is Islam. A bunch of lil-dicks beating women and suppressing them any way they can. The women listening to Obama’s speech may have applauded but remember, in the Religion Of Peace a woman’s applause is only worth half that of a man’s.

Watch, if you dare, videos of Islamists torturing women and you’ll know where Obama gets his ideas. Pam Geller at Atlas Shrugs blog site has a horrifying video of torture/port at her site today. She will release 10 of these truly sickening videos for every photo released to the ACLU of Americans “torturing” (not) enemy combatants.

The second cost function is the $L^2$ distance between the face vector of the input image and those of the outputs to make the autoencoder learn to perturb face images such that the accuracy of the face matcher is retained. The third cost term is the cross-entropy loss applied to the gender probabilities of the two outputs as computed by the auxiliary gender classifier, where the ground-truth label of the input image is used for the output of the same-gender prototype but the reverse is used for the output of the opposite-gender prototype. \[sec:ensemble-san-formulation\]

Ensemble SAN Formulation
------------------------

We assume that there exists a large set of gender classifiers $\mathcal{G}=\{G^1, G^2,..., G^n\}$, where each $G^i(X)$ predicts the gender of a person based on a 2D face image, $X$. Furthermore, we assume a set of face-matchers denoted by $\mathcal{M}=\{M^1, M^2,..., M^m\}$, where each $M^i(X_a, X_b)$ computes the match score between a pair of face images, $X_a$ and $X_b$. The goal of the work is to design an [*ensemble*]{} of $t$ SAN models, $\mathcal{S} = \{S^1, S^2,..., S^t\}$, that can be shown to generalize to arbitrary gender classifiers. In particular, we demonstrate that for each face image $X$, $\mathcal{S}$ produces a set of outputs $\mathcal{S}(X) = \{Y^1, Y^2,..., Y^t\}$ such that for each $G^i\in \mathcal{G}$, there exists at least one output $Y^j = S^j(X)$ that is able to confound $G"

market. At the end, it mentions a 20% drop in housing prices in some places,
but the article also mentions that cities responded to slowing housing markets
by removing a price _cap_ on units.

How is housing so expensive in the first place? Is it because of speculative

Electoral reform

Pope Nicholas II, elected in 1058, initiated a process of reform which exposed the underlying tension between empire and papacy. In 1059, at a synod in Rome, Nicholas condemned various abuses within the church, and issued In Nomine Domini. These included simony (the selling of clerical posts), the marriage of clergy and, more controversially, corrupt practices in papal elections. Nicholas then restricted the choice of a new pope to a conclave of cardinals, thus ruling out any direct influence by secular powers. The primary objective of these actions was to restrict the influence of the Holy Roman Emperor on papal elections. In 1061, the assembled bishops of Germany, the emperor's own faction, declared all the decrees of this pope null and void.

In 1059, Nicholas II took two steps of a kind which, while unusual at this period, would later become commonplace for the medieval papacy. He granted land, which was already occupied, to recipients of his own choice, engaging those recipients in a feudal relationship with the papacy, or the Holy See, as the feudal lord. The beneficiaries of Nicholas' land grants were the Normans, who were granted territorial rights in southern Italy and Sicily in return for feudal obligations to Rome.

These tensions between emperors and pontiffs were to continue into the twelfth century and ultimately gave rise to the ""distinctive separation of Church and State when the emperor signed the Concordat of Worms (1122) forfeiting any right to invest bishops with the ring and the staff symbolic of spiritual authority"". Papal victory was short-lived, and this attempted separation of the secular from the ecclesiastical did not end aspirations on the part of the emperors to influence the papacy, nor the aspirations of the popes to exercise political power.

During the reign of Pope Gregory VII, the title “pope” was officially restricted to the bishop of Rome. Gregory VII was also responsible for greatly expanding the power of the papacy in worldly matters. One of the great reforming popes, Gregory is perhaps best known for the part he played in the Investiture Controversy, which pitted him against Emperor Henry IV, and the Gregorian Reform process.

East-West Schism
The East-West Schism was the event that divided Chalcedonian Christianity into Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Though normally dated to 1054, the East-West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between the two Churches. The primary causes of the Schism were disputes over papal authority— the pope claimed he held authority over the four Eastern Greek-speaking patriarchs, and over the insertion of the filioque"
262,20,24052,"Q:

How to concat/combine two matrices of the same length to ""fill in the blanks"" of one of the matrices? R Question

I'm working on a binary integer programming assignment and I was hoping there would be a short cut to typing in all the ones and zeros for the constraints. I created two matrices. The first contains all zeros and the second contains all ones.
I have 34 variables and created two matrices like this (though I may not have needed to created these):
zero_constraints = matrix(data = 0, nrow = 1, ncol = 34)
one_constraints = matrix(data = 1, nrow = 1, ncol = 34)

Here's an example of the constraints:
# He therefore decides to include only one collage.
filter(data_raw, data_raw$Medium.Style == ""Collage"")$ID

output:
[1]  9 16 29 30

I gave each variable a number so these numbers would mean I needed variables 9, 16, 29, and 30 to be 1 and the rest of my variables to be 0.
This where I get lost:
one_constraints[, c(filter(data_raw, data_raw$Medium.Style == ""Collage"")$ID)]

I know the line above gets me the ""ones"" I need from my matrix of 34 ones so then I tried to concatenate my two matrices of ones and zeroes:
cat(
    one_constraints[, c(filter(data_raw, data_raw$Medium.Style == ""Collage"")$ID)],
    zero_constraints[, -c(filter(data_raw, data_raw$Medium.Style == ""Collage"")$ID)]
)

output: 
1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

but this is not the desired output. The ones should not be in a row at the beginning. It should look something like this:
0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0   0     0    0     0     0    0     0     0     0     0     1     1     0  "
263,9,15592,""" of the Gallican type.
Prayer Ante oculos tuos, Domine. It occurs in the same place in the Mass published by M. Flaccus Illyricus (Martène, I, 182).
Lethdirech sund. A half uncovering of the chalice and paten here. This is referred to in the tract as indinochtad corrici leth inna oblae agus incailich (the uncovering as far as half the oblation and chalice), and is associated there with the singing of the Gospel and Allóir. Earlier it is mentioned as following the Gradual.
Psalm cxl, 2, sung thrice.
Hic elivatur lintiamen calicis. Dr. Legg (Ecclesiological Essays, p. 133) mentions that this lifting of the veil was the practice in England just before the Reformation and in the Dioceses of Coutances and St.-Pol-de-Leon much later.
Prayer Veni Domine sanctificator. Nearly the {""Veni sanctificator"" of the present Roman Offertory.

1 to 8 are in the original hand, part of 9 is inserted by Moel Caich, possibly over erasures, the rest is written by Moel Caich on added leaves. The psalm verses are only indicated by their beginnings and endings. Perhaps the prayers were said and the ceremonies with the chalice veil were performed by the priest while the congregation sang the psalms and Alleluia. Nothing of all this is in the Bobbio. Possibly, judging from the collect Post Benedictionem, which is the collect which follows the Benedictus es (Dan., iii) on Ember Saturdays in the Roman missal, either the Benedicite or this Benedictus came between the Epistle and Gospel, as in the Gallican of St. Germain's description.

The Gospel and Creed
Gospel reading. In the Stowe Mass, this is St. John vi, 51–57. This begins in Moel Caich's hand on an inserted sheet and ends in the original hand. The tracts say that the Gospel was followed by the ""Alloir"", which Dr. Stokes translates ""Alleluia"", but Macgregor takes to mean ""blessing"" and compares with the Per evangelica dicta, etc., of the Roman rite.

An Oratio Gregorii super evangelium is included, on an inserted slip in Moel Caich's hand. In the Gregorian Sacramentary on the second Saturday and third Sunday of Lent, but not in connection with the Gospel. The Creed is in the original hand, with the ""Filioque"" inserted between the lines, possibly by Moel Caich.

Offertory
The order of the offertory in the Stowe Missal is:
Landirech sund (a full uncovering here). In Moel Caich's hand.
Ostende nobis, Domine, misericordiam, etc. thrice.
Oblata, Domine, munera sanctifica, nosque a peccatorum nostrorum maculis emunda. This is in the Bobbio Missal (where it is called ""post nomina"") and in the Gelasian and Gregorian. It is the secreta of the third mass of Christmas Day in the Roman missals until 1962. According to the tract, the chalice was elevated while this was sung, after the full uncovering. The Leabhar Breac says that it was elevated quando cantitur Imola Deo sacrificum laudis.
Prayer Hostias quaesumus, Domine. This occurs in one set of ""Orationes et preces divinae"" in the Leonine Sacramentary. It is written here by Moel Caich over an erasure which begins with ""G"", probably, as Warner conjectures, the prayer ""Grata sit tibi"", which follows ""Oblata, Domine"" in the Bobbio Missal. In Moelcaich's correction this in an amplified form occurs later.
Prayer Has oblationes et sincera labamina. In Moel Caich's hand. This prayer, which includes an intercession pro animabus carorum nostrorum N. et cararum nostrarum quorum nomina recitamus, is evidently a relic of the former reading"
264,24,2097,"Would Volunteering At An Animal Shelter Be Possible?

I plan to start volunteering at my local animal shelter soon but have some concerns before signing up. The volunteer position entails playing with, walking, and talking to the cats and dogs in order to get them socialized and ready for adoption. It doesn't list feeding as one of the responsibilities but my guess is that I would be somewhat involved in feeding. I'm pretty sure the food that the shelter uses contains gluten. My cat's food has gluten but it's a little different when it's just her and I can scoop it, put it in her bowl, close the container, and wash my hands immediately after. If I was feeding a large number of animals or even just playing with them and trying to avoid kisses, it seems like it would be much harder. Do you think it's a possibility that I could still volunteer?

I don't really want to talk to the shelter people about it because I feel weird volunteering my time and then bringing up the whole gluten thing and making it all about me and my issue. I could ask to wear gloves when feeding but I wouldn't want to wear them around the animals in case they spooked them. If it were you would you feel uncomfortable bringing up your dietary issues or even be worried about the dog and cat food at all?

abby03, I can't think of a reason why you should not volunteer. Yes, you should wash your hands (or anything else little doggie and kitty mouths touch), especially before you eat. And I wouldn't let animals lick me on the face (especially near my mouth) no matter how cute or loving - in case you"

Hennessy Hammock Weathershield Questions

I just bought a Nest and No Sniveller from JRB for use mainly with my HH AULB. My plan is to use both the No Snilveller and Nest together as an under quilt in extreme cold conditions and use my WM Apache 15 degree bag inside the hammock

I wanted to make one from the same material Frogg Toggs are made of and after starting a thread on WB I found out they are made of micro porus polypropylene (MPP for short). I think this is the same stuff JRB uses for their weather shields. The stuff is breathable, waterproof, and very light. On the downside it is very fragile and tears easily. I found this stuff for sell at Outdoor Wilderness Fabrics under the name of Duravent described as:

Duravent is a patented 3 layer fabric with a micro porous film sandwiched between 2 layers of soft but tough Polypropylene.

They list it as weighing 3.2oz in the description. I am assuming that's per square yard. That seems kinda heavy to me for the Frogg Togg material. There were also suggestions of using Tyvek in the thread at WB. I also have some 1.1 oz silnylon in the collection of fabric I have amassed at home.

What would be the best choice of material for a weather shield? I like the idea of MPP but I don't want to go buy more material and spend more money if I don't have to. I'm not even sure if that's what I am looking for.

Silnylon would be my next choice. It would have the advantage of also being a wind blocking material which may help give a few degrees extra in cold weather protection but I am afraid of condensation issues between the Nest and the silnylon. Should I worry about this? Do I need a breathable fabric?

Tyvek is another option. I have a roll of the Tyvek for soft sided structure which is supposed to be breathable. It is also waterproof but I don't care for the stark white color so it's my last choice.

I also have some questions on the design of the weather shield (WS for short). When I first started thinking about it I wanted something like Jeff's travel pod which would encase the entire hammock. The HH's entry method seems like it would make a ""pod"" style WS a little hard to deal with and a hassle to get in and out of, especially when I may be dealing with 2 under quilts.

I think a 2 piece design would be best. A bottom section that is basically large enough to cover both quilts without interfering with the loft of the under quilt(s). I also want to make a top WS that goes on the outside of the hammock and covers the entire bug netting portion. The top WS would serve several purposes: I am thinking that enclosing the netting would give you an area inside the hammock that could be warmed up, like"

269,20,28840,"Patrick Mahoney, a master’s student at the University of New Hampshire, was cycling home last October when a car knocked him off his bike. He hit his head and it was bad.

Don and Mary Mahoney were home in New Jersey when they got the call: Their son was in a coma. They dropped everything and headed up to Boston, where Pat was fighting for his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.

One of Mary’s oldest friends, Mary Mallon, heard about the accident and called her cousin, a priest in Mississippi. His name is the Rev. Tommy Conway, and Mary Mallon asked him if he remembered that couple from New Jersey he had met at a cookout years ago. Father Tommy has a memory like an elephant, and he described them head to toe.

“Well,’’ Mary Mallon said, “I want you to pray for their son, Patrick, because he’s in a bad way.’’

“Where is he in hospital?’’ Father Tommy asked.

“Boston,’’ Mary Mallon said.

“Where are his parents staying?’’ Father Tommy asked.

When he heard they were staying at a hotel, Father Tommy said, “That won’t do.’’ He hung up, and before he said a prayer for Patrick Mahoney he made a phone call for Don and Mary Mahoney. He called Jonathan Papelbon, the Red Sox closer, one of his parishioners at St. Thomas Aquinas in Hattiesburg. Father Tommy baptized Jonathan and Ashley Papelbon’s kids, and he asked a question to which he already knew the answer.

“It was the offseason, Jonathan and Ashley were here in Mississippi, and so I knew their place in Boston was empty,’’ Father Tommy Conway said. “As soon as I explained the situation to Jonathan, he said straight away, ‘They can use our place.’ I never got the question out. Jonathan beat me to it. Which, knowing him, is what I expected.’’

That was the easy part. The hard part was getting Don and Mary Mahoney to take up the offer.

“They were very reluctant; they felt they were imposing,’’ Father Tommy said. “But Jonathan and Ashley insisted. They didn’t want the Mahoneys to go broke taking care of their son. Jonathan and Ashley are parents, and they knew if they were in the same situation, they would want to be by their child’s side.’’

Mary Mahoney was overwhelmed.

“We’re strangers,’’ she said. “They didn’t know us. They didn’t know anything about us. But they trusted Father Tommy.’’

So the Mahoneys of Cranford, N.J., moved into the Papelbons’ spacious, gracious condo on Beacon Street.

“It was unbelievable,’’ Mary Mahoney said. “We could walk to Mass. General to see Pat every day. Then he was transferred to Spaulding Rehab, so we walked there every day. We were there for months. It’s a beautiful place.’’

By the time Opening Day rolled around last month, Patrick was ready to be transferred to a rehab facility in New Hampshire. Papelbon and his family were still on the road by the time the Mahoneys left. “We still haven’t met them face to face,’’ Mary Mahoney said. “Ashley stays in touch. She wants to know how Pat is doing.’’

The Mahoneys told me this story because they know of no other way to repay the Papelbons for their kindness to total strangers. “They wouldn’t want the publicity,’’ Father Tommy was saying. “I could talk to you the rest of the day about the people here in Mississippi that"
270,26,5815," vertical integration of the big mills. Nylon 6,6 is produced by independent fiber manufacturers like Invista, Ascend and Universal.

In some ways nylon 6 and 6,6 are very similar. Both are high performance fibers with good resilience, and durability sufficient for all commercial segments. In some ways, nylon 6,6 has natural advantages. Both fibers can stain, but in general nylon 6 takes acid dye somewhat more readily than nylon 6,6, which means that it also stains more easily. However, stain resist technologies, properly maintained with cleaners up to a pH of 10 to avoid stripping away the acid dye blocks, reduce the significance of those differences. So while the two fiber types may perform equally well when new, it’s a different story if maintenance is inadequate in preventing the treatments from being scraped off.

Another difference between the fibers is that nylon 6,6 absorbs more water than nylon 6, so low moisture encapsulation systems can be more efficient than, for instance, hot water extraction systems.

Steve Spencer, a facility specialist at State Farm, encountered a unique situation at a 350,000 square foot facility he was working with in Phoenix ten or so years ago. He had specified a multicolored heather pile broadloom in the building from Antron, which was part of DuPont back then. A few years later he was informed that all the carpet wasn’t holding up well. The carpet had been installed in two spaces separated by a wall, and each space received equal traffic and the same maintenance regimen. However, the carpet on the left was not faring as well as the carpet on the right, and Spencer found out that it was identical in every way (same weight, same backing, both solution dyed) to the Antron nylon 6,6 product on the right, but in the specification process the carpet on the left ended up being made of nylon 6. A close examination of samples revealed that the fibers were brittle and discolored with all of the multicolor fading except for blue.

It’s worth noting that this was at least a decade ago, before the mills vertically integrated and started pouring R&D dollars into ensuring that their nylon 6 could perform. But the lesson from the anecdote is that all carpets are not equal and they don’t clean equally well. And the best way to get the performance required is to know the product’s characteristics and maintain it accordingly.

LESSONS FROM THE FIELDWhen Spencer first started managing facilities 20 years ago, the carpet was switched out every six years. But since then he has developed a suite of strategies that has allowed him to consistently keep carpet down in good condition for up to 15 years. First and foremost is his strategy for keeping out soil, because he credits abrasion from dry dirt as having the biggest impact on carpet deterioration. So he traps dirt in walk-off mats and has the main and central aisles vacuumed every day. Though he’ll use a range of cleaning technologies, including hot water extraction, low moisture encapsulation and dry systems like Capture and Host, he’ll do an annual flushing once a year"

Second Class Inducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame

More than 120 guests gathered at the Community Aquatic and Recreation Complex (CARC) gymnasium as former athletes were inducted into the Garrett College Athletic Hall of Fame on October 28.

The second class of inductees to the Athletic Hall of Fame included Michele Duling, Benny Shreve, Ed Wildesen, and the 1994 men's basketball team.

Duling, an All-American women's basketball player, was the first inductee of the evening. A Garrett County native and Southern High School graduate, she was also Garrett College's first Kodak-All American. A prolific scorer, Duling had a career-high 40 points in a game against Baltimore City Community College, scoring more than 30 points on numerous occasions. In addition to her all-American award, she was both first-team all-Region XX and first-team all-Maryland Junior College Athletic Conference.

Coach Lawrence Nesselrodt, introduced two-time all-Region XX baseball player Benny Shreve. He reflected on the time Nesselrodt and coach Phil Caruso and initially met Shreve in Elkins, West Virginia and recruited him to play at Garrett. ""Benny made it real easy to be a recruiter, because he was the guy that had that ‘it' factor, and every team he played on he led by example, and he got the job done.""

At Garrett, Shreve set personal single-season team records for hits (64), runs (53) and triples (6). Finishing with a.429 career batting average, he received a full-tuition scholarship to play baseball at West Virginia University for two seasons before being drafted by the Chicago Cubs.

Shreve commended both of his coaches, Nesselrodt and Caruso, for his success and ultimately, recruiting him to play at Garrett. ""I believe Garrett is one of the finest institutions in the country, both academically and athletically. It was one of the best decisions I made in my life.""

Each protocol contained a structured assessment of discharge readiness plus an instruction for nurse action. The READI1 protocol required the discharging nurse to complete an assessment of patient readiness on the day of hospital discharge using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale nurse form (RN-RHDS)^[@zoi180308r16],[@zoi180308r21]^ and instructed the nurses to use their best judgment with the assessment information to guide actions in completing their patients' preparation for discharge. The READI2 protocol added the patient self-assessment version of the RHDS (PT-RHDS),^[@zoi180308r16],[@zoi180308r17]^ which was reviewed by the discharging nurse immediately before completing the RN-RHDS, so that the patient's perspective would inform the nurse's assessment and action. The READI3 protocol additionally instructed nurses that a score lower than 7 of 10 on the RN-RHDS or PT-RHDS indicates low readiness^[@zoi180308r16]^ and required documentation of an action to improve readiness and reduce readmission risk for any low value.

The RN-RHDS and PT-RHDS are parallel 8-item forms to rate readiness for hospital discharge on the day of discharge on a scale from 0 to 10. Scores below 7 indicate low readiness.^[@zoi180308r16]^ Administered in the 4 hours prior to discharge and following the decision to discharge, the scales measure the degree of readiness for discharge to home self-management close to the time of discharge but with sufficient time to address remaining patient needs before discharge. The forms capture 4 dimensions of readiness (2 items per scale): personal status (physical readiness and energy); knowledge (problems to watch for and restrictions); perceived coping ability (ability to handle demands at home and perform personal care); and expected support (help with personal care and help with medical care).^[@zoi180308r15]^ Scale reliability in prior studies ranged from 0.78 to 0.93.^[@zoi180308r15],[@zoi180308r16],[@zoi180308r17],[@zoi180308r18],[@zoi180308r19],[@zoi180308r20],[@zoi180308r21]^ Nurses can complete the form in under 2 minutes; patients typically require 2 to 5 minutes.

Intervention unit nurses attended mandatory training in the 2 weeks prior to the start of each protocol that included an overview of prior research on discharge readiness, the association with postdischarge outcomes, and detailed instructions on implementation of the protocols. Training in the study protocol was incorporated into orientation for newly hired nurses, and training modules were available for float nurses who were assigned patients being discharged.

281,25,868,"The Ethics of the Séralini Retraction and Charges of Conflict of Interest

According to SpinWatch, a European muckraking organization, 11 of the authors of letters to the editor slamming Séralini’s study had undisclosed financial relationships with Monsanto. In 2013, Paul Christou, the editor of Transgenic Research, coauthored an attack on Séralini and the FCT editors in his own journal, calling for a retraction of the study. Christou did not disclose his multiple conflicts of interest, including being an inventor on patents on GM crop technology, many of which Monsanto owns. Meanwhile, back at Food and Chemical Toxicology, a new position for an associate editor was filled by Richard E. Goodman, a University of Nebraska professor who previously worked for Monsanto, and who has a longstanding association with the industry-funded International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Months later, Elsevier, FCT’s publisher, announced the retraction.

The quality of Séralini’s work aside, the process by which his paper was retracted reeks of industry pressure. The progression of science is not the least bit linear, but the process has to proceed unencumbered by censorship of unpopular or commercially disadvantageous results. The peer review process is imperfect – there are countless bad studies in the medical literature – but peer review works best when the efforts of reviewers and editors are devoid of conflicts of interest and outside pressures. The self-correcting nature of science can only work when industry does not taint the process.

... It would have been perfectly appropriate for the journal to have written an editorial expressing its concerns. Instead, it seems the editors may have succumbed to industry pressure to do the wrong thing. The media coverage in the U.S. has been one-sided; criticism of Séralini’s study has been widely covered in mainstream press, while information about the conflicts of interest of critics have remained in the alternative press.

The article raises a number of issues worth addressing.

First, Fugh-Berman and Sherman fail to put the retraction in the context of Séralini’s own ethical lapses. There were lapses in both the execution of the study and in his handling of the publicity following publication.

Letting those tumors grow to the sizes they did was a major ethical lapse. In the context of the issues raised by the article though, what’s more germane is Séralini’s decision to embargo the release of the study. This was clearly done to foil critical coverage of a clearly weak study. Timing the release the study in tandem with his book tour was also highly questionable behavior for a scientist.

The evidence that the study presented was inconclusive and yet Séralini made confident conclusions. That was highly problematic. It’s one thing to publish inconclusive results. It’s another thing to portray the evidence as demonstrating something that it does not. Even more problematic is that he went around the world trumpeting his conclusions. “Data” from inconclusive studies shouldn’t end up plastered on picket signs. In the face of the avalanche of criticism and debunking his research received, the ethical thing for Séralini to have done would have been to withdraw the paper rather than promote it. The paper made have slipped through the initial peer review, but it was absolutely eviscerated in post publication peer review. That much is undeniable.

Regarding the insinuations the journal bowed to industry pressure. The incentives don"
282,14,28460,"Coloradans who leave their homes to go grocery shopping or take a walk around their neighborhood should now wear non-medical cloth face masks while they’re in public, Gov. Jared Polis announced Friday as the state’s coronavirus deaths surpassed 100.

That declaration came ahead of President Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration is encouraging Americans to wear face masks in public, though he stressed that the recommendation is optional and said he will not be complying with it.

Medical masks should still be saved for health care workers, said Polis, who donned a mask of his own at an afternoon news conference, but everyone should be using cloth masks that cover their mouth and nose.

It’s time to make mask-wearing cool, the governor said. The state will hand out masks with the private-sector’s help, with a goal of 100,000 distributed per week, Polis said. He also encouraged Coloradans to make their own.

“Get out those old T-shirts,” Polis said. “A 1998 guacamole champion. It shrunk, you thought you’d never use it again. Get it out of your drawer and make it into a mask.”

After wearing the masks out in public, the governor said, people should put them in a heated wash, before washing their hands and face.

The recommendations for individuals to wear masks — even homemade ones — while in public stem from data showing that a large percentage of people with COVID-19 do not have symptoms but could be passing on the virus unknowingly, said Mike Van Dyke, associate professor at the Colorado School of Public Health.

The masks, he said, may help slow the spread of the coronavirus from this population. But there’s conflicting data on whether masks help protect the wearer.

“There’s like some benefit for both, but I think the larger benefit is really to prevent those droplets in those people who are asymptomatic from getting into the environment,” Van Dyke said. “We want to make sure and wash the masks and be really careful about washing our hands when we wash the outside of the masks,” he said, adding that people should continue to socially distance themselves.

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said earlier this week that he had asked federal health officials to review changing the guidelines regarding who should wear masks because of how the new coronavirus is spread by individuals without symptoms.

Health officials initially warned “against the general public wearing face masks based on the best available science at the time regarding whether or not they prevent wearers from catching coronavirus,” Adams tweeted. “But we are learning more about this disease every day.”

Along with the new face mask recommendations, Polis announced extensions until the end of the month for those signing up for health insurance through the state, and extensions for businesses to file and remit sales tax.

Small businesses also will be able to get forgivable loans through ChooseColorado.com, while regulations will be relaxed to allow bar and restaurant workers to be delivery drivers, Polis said. Restrictions on fostering and adopting pets will also be eased.

After weeks lamenting the state’s lackluster COVID-19 testing capabilities, Polis expressed optimism Friday that Colorado has made “enormous strides on testing.”

==========

Giant cell tumour of bone (GCT) is a bone neoplasm which is locally aggressive and can rarely metastasize. Histone 3.3 mutations of the *H3F3A* gene were recently described for GCT of bone and may prove useful in clarifying diagnosis in challenging cases \[[@CR1]\]. The incidence of GCT of bone has not been completely established but it is around half as common as osteosarcoma. This would suggest an incidence of around 1.5/million population per year. GCT typically arises at the end of a long bone in a skeletally mature individual but can also arise in the axial skeleton and occasionally in children. The standard treatment is surgery aiming for as near complete removal of the tumour as is possible without major morbidity. This is usually by detailed curettage, although in tumours with extensive bone destruction, resection or even amputation may be required. Adjuvant therapies during or after surgery such as the concomitant use of bone cement, phenol, ethanol, cryotherapy, or intravenous and oral bisphosphonates have been advocated to try and decrease the risk of local recurrence, but no randomised trial has ever been carried out to prove the efficacy of any of these \[[@CR2]--[@CR6]\]. Local recurrence is reported to occur in between 19--50 % of cases and usually arises within 2 years \[[@CR4], [@CR7]--[@CR9]\]. Local recurrence can often be treated by repeat curettage but sometimes requires more morbid surgery to achieve complete tumour clearance.

GCTs with extensive soft tissue extension (grade 3 according to Campanacci grade 3 by radiology) and those of the axial skeleton are particularly challenging to treat and have been shown to have higher local recurrence rates \[[@CR10]--[@CR12]\]. In some cases, GCT of the spine and skull can be deemed inoperable, with complete tumour removal by surgery impossible due to the proximity of vital structures \[[@CR12], [@CR13]\]. Treatment in these difficult cases usually consists of debulking surgery (incomplete removal) and/or the use of adjuvants such as embolization \[[@CR14], [@CR15]\], radiation therapy \[[@CR11], [@CR16], [@CR17]\], bisphosphonates \[[@CR18], [@CR19]\], and more recently, Denosumab \[[@CR20], [@CR21]\]. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is not active in classic GCT of bone, even if anecdotal responses to osteosarcoma-like regimens containing platinum and anthracyclines have been reported in the metastastic setting \[["

The question of a municipality's power to tax users of its public ways, and the question how that power may or may not be curtailed by the Telephone and Telegraph Act, are ones of broad, general significance, are not fact-laden, and ordinarily would be eminently suitable for certification.   Ordinarily.  But here both questions are already before the state supreme court, in a case to be argued in two weeks.   It is probably too late to consolidate a certified question in our case with the appeal in Arlington Heights, and anyway what purpose would be served by having the same issue briefed and perhaps argued by two sets of lawyers?   The lawyers in our case could have submitted (we believe did submit) amicus briefs in Arlington Heights if they mistrusted the abilities of their counterparts in that case.

What would make no sense would be for us to resolve the issue with finality only to discover to the immense harm of one of the parties that we had guessed wrong about Illinois law.   But a wrong guess could do no harm here.   If we dissolve the preliminary injunction, the case will remain in the district court, no doubt to be stayed until Arlington Heights is decided, and then decided consistently with that decision.   Only if Arlington Heights should be disposed of without a resolution of the issue of municipal taxing powers--which of course is possible, if only because the parties to that case may settle before the supreme court decides it--would our resolution be the final one.   As it should be, in that event, to head off a further appeal.

Some federal judges are timid about deciding issues of state law, because they fear that by doing so they will confuse that law.   The fear is groundless.   State courts are not bound by federal courts' interpretations of state law.   A state judge will give such interpretations no more weight than their persuasiveness earns them.   And this is not a case in which the party seeking an answer to difficult questions of state law has wormed his way into federal court in some questionable manner that should make us feel that we are being dragged gratuitously into the middle of a dispute that belongs in state court.

thus time rolled on, and the ""Tales"" were no nearer publication than
they were years ago, and might still have remained in this state for
years longer but for an unforeseen incident. One morning, whilst taking
a constitutional in a neighbouring suburb, the author's attention was
attracted by a strange-looking stringed instrument of undoubted
antiquity, in the window of an old curiosity shop. He would enquire the
price of it. The proprietor, a weasel-faced little man, with a polished
bald head, foxy beard streaked with grey, and a nose rather red at the
tip, stood at the door of his shop. His ferret eyes spotted a customer.

""What is the price of that instrument?""

""One guinea.""

""I'll take it. Wrap it up in paper.""

""Right you are, sir. Good morning, sir. Thank you.""

And off trudged the author with this new acquisition to his collection
of curios.

Little did he imagine at the time what an important part this same
weasely little man was destined to play in the drama of his every day
life. Soon after this a second visit was paid to the shop. It was a
strange place, choked with odd lumber, where any curio might be
obtained, from a mermaid to a mummy. A stuffed crocodile hung in the
window. There were cases of stuffed birds and animals, dummies in
costume, old pictures, antique furniture, armour, weapons, coins, and
postage stamps. A third and fourth visit succeeded, and after almost
every visit the author's collection was enriched by some new curio. At
length, so frequent became these visits to the curio shop, that hardly a
day passed without the author putting in an appearance. Some two years
may thus have passed away, during which time the author had ample
opportunity of studying this human weasel. He learned that he was a
bum-bailiff, a commission agent, etc., ready to undertake any odd job
for money.

Here, then, at last, was the very man. The author accordingly propounded
his plan of publishing the ""Tales."" That weasel nose sniffed business.
With alacrity he seized the MSS., and donning a new top hat, which he
did whenever he desired to create an impression of respectability, he
climbed to the top of a 'bus, and was soon landed in the thick of our
metropolis. From that time all has been comparatively plain sailing.

CHAPTER VI."
288,26,2237," system 100′ according to U.S. Pat. No. 6,515,740 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,580,496. Unless otherwise stated, reference numerals in FIG. 2A may be understood to refer to elements identical to what has been described with respect to the TOF system of FIG. 1.
In FIG. 2A, an exciter 115 drives emitter 120 with a preferably low power (e.g., perhaps 50 mW peak) periodic waveform, producing optical energy emissions of known frequency (perhaps a few hundred MHz) for a time period known as the shutter time (perhaps 10 ms). Energy from emitter 120 and detected signals within pixel detectors 140 are synchronous to each other such that phase difference and thus distance Z can be measured for each pixel detector.
The optical energy detected by the two-dimensional imaging sensor array 130 will include amplitude or intensity information, denoted as “A”, as well as phase shift information, denoted as φ. As depicted in exemplary waveforms in FIGS. 2B, 2C, 2D, the phase shift information varies with distance Z and can be processed to yield Z data. For each pulse or burst of optical energy transmitted by emitter 120, a three-dimensional image of the visible portion of target object 20 is acquired, from which intensity and Z data is obtained (DATA'). As described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,515,740 and 6,580,496 obtain depth information Z requires acquiring at least two samples of the target object (or scene) 20 with 90° phase shift between emitted optical energy and the pixel detected signals. While two samples is a minimum figures, preferably four samples, 90° apart in phase, are acquired to permit detection error reduction due to mismatches in pixel detector performance, mismatches in associated electronic implementations, and other errors. On a per pixel detector basis, the measured four sample data are combined to produce actual Z depth information data. Further details as to implementation of various embodiments of phase shift systems may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,515,740 and 6,580,496. However while the systems and methods described in these two patents can acquire Z information, accuracy of the acquired Z information is not known on a per frame basis.
Many factors, including ambient light, can affect reliability of data acquired by TOF systems. The depth accuracy of Z-data information acquired by pixel detectors 140 in array 130 will vary with the amount of optical energy incident on the pixel detector. In extreme cases there can be too little reflected optical energy, for example from dark target objects 20, perhaps black motor vehicle tires, dark clothing on a pedestrian, etc. On the other hand, an overly reflective target object 20 can reflect too much optical energy. An excess of incoming optical energy can saturate the pixel detector, with the result that the Z-data indicates that the target object 20 moved. However the data alone cannot be used to discern whether the target object 20 actually moved, or whether pixel detector saturation has produced erroneous Z-data indicative of movement, when in fact there was no movement. In these and other extreme cases, the Z-data provided by the TOF system can include incorrect depth information. But while the information is incorrect, the prior art provides no mechanism to so identify the questionable Z-data.
As a result, in an attempt to reduce errors, in some TOF systems the transmitted optical energy may be emitted multiple times using different systems settings to increase reliability of the acquired TOF measurements. For example, the initial phase of the emitted optical energy might be varied to cope with various ambient and reflectivity conditions. The amplitude of the emitted energy might be varied to increase system dynamic range. The exposure duration of the emitted optical energy may be varied to increase dynamic range of the system. Further, frequency of the emitted optical energy may be varied to improve the unambiguous range of the system measurements.
In practice, TOF systems may combine multiple measurements to arrive at a final depth image. But if there is relative motion between system 100 or 100′ and target object 20 while the measurements are being made, the TOF data and final depth image can be degraded by so-called motion blur. For example, while acquiring TOF measurements, system 100 may move, and/or target object 20 may move, or may comprise a scene that include motion. If shutter time is 10 ms (25 frames/second), relative motion occurring faster than about 1/40 ms (for a four-sample acquisition) will produce motion blur. As a result, the motion blur will cause erroneous distance Z data, and will yield a depth image with errors. Unfortunately prior art systems do not provide a mechanism to alert the end user of the Z data that the data being processed at"

In post-Ca2+ events, depletion of Ca2+ in the ER induces the activation of CRAC channels, and capacitative Ca2+ influx through the CRAC channel sustains high intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). This prolonged high [Ca2+]i activates cytosolic signal transduction to produce lipid mediators (e.g., LTD4), cytokines [e.g., interleukin-2 (IL-2)], and matrix metalloproteinases, which participate in the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
These facts suggest that CRAC channel modulators can be useful for the treatment of diseases caused by the activation of inflammatory cells without side effects observed in steroids. Since VOC channel modulators would cause adverse events in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, it may be necessary for CRAC channel modulators to exhibit sufficient selectivity over VOC channels if they are to be used as anti-inflammatory drugs.
Accordingly, CRAC channel modulators have been said to be useful in treatment, prevention and/or amelioration of diseases or disorders associated with calcium release-activated calcium channel including, but not limited to, inflammation, glomerulonephritis, uveitis, hepatic diseases or disorders, renal diseases or disorders,"

On March 27, 1995, in response to the temporary award of custody, Johnston filed a pro se objection to the award. She denied allegations that she sexually molested her daughter, and she denied ever abusing illegal drugs. Johnston also explained to the court that her response to the temporary order was delayed because of her ""low income and... inability to secure legal representation."" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 86. At that time, Johnston did not give notice to the court that she or the children were of native Alaskan Indian descent.
Trial for the third party custody petition did not occur until March 1999 due to additional delays caused by the inability of both parties to retain and keep legal counsel, various motions, and two interventions in the matter filed by the Tlingit-Haida and Sitka Indian Tribes of Alaska.
After a four-day trial, the superior court judge awarded Mahaney residential custody of both children, finding that placement to be in the best interests of the children. In spite of the custody award to Mahaney, the trial judge retained jurisdiction, provided for a 90-day review, and ordered Johnston to engage in remedial services directed toward possible reunification with the children.
The court considered the children's ""special needs"" as they were causally connected to allegations of past sexual abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse, and essential abandonment by both parents demonstrated in part by the length of time the children have resided with Mahaney. In 1997, experts diagnosed both children as suffering from the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome.
Mahaney's granddaughter, Natasha, has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and related behavioral disorders, including impulsivity and poor management of anger. When Mahaney observed and received complaints that Natasha engages in public masturbation, she sought special treatment for this problem. Natasha reported during therapy that her mother taught her to masturbate by sticking her hands in her pants, and commented that ""at least [maternal uncle] Chuckie asked me if he could do it."" CP at 177.
Mahaney's grandson, Jesse, has been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, defiance, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorders. Jesse also exhibits behaviors associated with sexual molestation. He reported that his maternal uncle, Chuckie, touched his genitalia. Jesse has also received therapy. Mahaney asserts that both the children's problems are exacerbated when they are confronted with the possibility of having to return to their mother and Alaska.
The custody award required Johnston to undertake certain steps aimed at possible reunification. Johnston did make earnest attempts to comply with the court's plan. However, telephone contact was made difficult due to the estrangement between Mahaney and Johnston.

Fernando Cesário Nunes de Almeida, adido de imprensa da embaixada de Portugal na RDA (República Democrática Alemã) desde 1974, intérprete, hoje com 70 anos e homossexual assumido, estranhou aquela manhã de 27 de Julho de 1979 em que chegou ao gabinete e a secretária lhe disse que o embaixador tinha sido chamado de urgência ao Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros, com a indicação expressa de não ir com ele. O press-attaché inquietou-se porque era o único funcionário da representação portuguesa que falava alemão, pelo que acompanhava sempre o embaixador nos contactos com o governo da ex-RDA.

Percebeu logo que algo estava errado. Uns dias antes, Portugal tinha expulsado um adido de imprensa da RDA em Lisboa, por estar a incitar manobras subversivas contra a reforma agrária. Pensou que teria sido ele o escolhido pela ditadura comunista para retaliar — uma prática frequente entre diplomacias quando um país declara um cidadão estrangeiro como persona non grata.

E com que pretexto? Achou que talvez usassem um delito menor, com o qual já o tinham confrontado: o transporte de antiguidades e porcelanas da Alemanha de Leste para o lado ocidental, na mala do carro, sem a autorização burocrática oficial. (Ainda hoje tem algumas dessas peças a decorar a sua casa em Berlim, desde uns jarrões de estanho, a cristais e um candeeiro de tecto.)

The Fiat 1100 is a small family car produced from 1937 to 1953 by the Italian car manufacturer Fiat. It was introduced in 1937 as Fiat 508 C or Balilla 1100, as a replacement for the Fiat 508 Balilla. Under the new body the 508 C had more modern and refined mechanicals compared to the 508, including independent front suspension and an enlarged overhead valve engine.
In 1939 it was updated and renamed simply Fiat 1100. The 1100 was produced in three consecutive series—1100, 1100 B and 1100 E—until 1953, when it was replaced by the all-new, unibody Fiat 1100/103.

History

The Fiat 508 C was first introduced in 1937. It was powered by a 1,089 cc four-cylinder overhead-valve engine rather than the earlier Balilla's 1-litre unit. Power was up by a third, to  at 4,000 rpm.
Drive was to the rear wheels through a 4-speed gearbox, and for the period, its comfort, handling, and performance were prodigious, making it ""the only people's car that was also a driver's car"". Unusual for a modestly priced car of the time was the independent front suspension, while the rear had a leaf sprung live axle. According to the manufacturer top speed was.

Exterior styling recalled the 1935 Fiat 1500 and the 1936 Fiat 500 ""Topolino"", with the typical mid-thirties heart-shaped front grille.
The main body style for the Fiat 508 C was a 4-door pillarless saloon with 4 side windows (two windows on each side without the rear quarter window), and suicide doors at the rear. Other body styles listed by Fiat were a 4-door convertible saloon (saloon with folding roof, based on the standard 4-door model), a 4-door torpedo, a 2-door 4-seat cabriolet, and, for a brief period, a sporty 2-door 2-seat spider built by Carrozzeria Viotti.

In 1938 Fiat put on sale a long-wheelbase six-passenger variant, named 508 L. Besides the  extended wheelbase (at ), other differences from the 508 C were wider wheels and tyres (5.50–15 instead of 5.00–15 tyres) and a shorter final drive ratio, which reduced top speed to. The 508 L was sold as a 4-door, 6-window saloon, pillarless and with rear-hinged aft doors like the 508 C, able to carry six passenger thanks to two foldaway seats. Additionally there was a 4-door, 6-window taxi (Tassì) version, which differed in possessing a B-pillar—to which all four doors were hinged—and a partition between the driver and passenger compartments.

On to the Chicago of 1968. The John Hancock Building — “Big John,” as it was called — had just been built. The Sears Tower hadn’t. There were four daily newspapers. The city was the personal fiefdom of Mayor Richard J. Daley, in his 13th year in office. He controlled the Democratic Party, the city workers, and he wanted his city to shine in the gaze of the nation, having recently suffered through the bad publicity of the King riots and his notorious “shoot-to-kill” order.

Daley blamed the King riots on police restraint and ordered his brass: no more pussyfooting around.

“Daley For President” buttons were seen around City Hall, though the joke was that Daley wouldn’t want the demotion, preferring to dispatch one of his flunkies to Washington instead.

He had the power, and he decreed: There would be no hippies running riot in Chicago. There would be no permit to hold a Festival of Life. The parks would close at 11 p.m. The city of Chicago would hold firm in the face of an invasion of outsider rabble.

And in the eyes of blue-collar Chicagoans, particularly the police, the protesters were rabble, an unwashed, drugged, long-hair mob.

“Revulsion against this rabble came from the sweat of the people in this town, the sweat of their toil,” former Chicago cop Milt Brower told Frank Kusch in his essential book “Battleground Chicago: The Police and the 1968 Democratic National Convention.” “They were hard-working people who would not put up with the things that were beginning to happen.”

Or, as Bob Angone puts it today: “There was that hawk-and-dove sh– going on in the country.”

Chicago police attitudes were such that, several days before the convention began, with the National Guard had already been called up, police Supt. Conlisk felt the need to issue the following reminder to his officers:

Naturally, they want minimal identification required of them, and they want the DLs to be identical to citizens’ licenses (despite the federal requirement that licenses show the driver is an illegal alien ).

Also, the moochy lawbreakers want the licenses to be cheap, even though the cost to implement the new benefit for aliens will be $141 million over three years. Foreign pests want citizen taxpayers to pick up the tab for the mini-amnesty, as they have been trained to expect by liberals.

Unsurprisingly the local “news” outlet starts out with a sob story of a foreign job thief and how deserving is. And she will have more “confidence” due to the unworthy benefit — self-esteem!

That’s what California offers these days — self-esteem (and money!) for illegal aliens.

Although each party's version of the accident is different, there is one common similarity, i.e., a green light. Ms. Hamilton testified that she had a green light to cross over U.S. Hwy. 71 and Mr. Walker stated that the minivan directly in front of him had a green light to cross over onto U.S. Hwy. 71. The evidence suggests that Ms. Hamilton had a green light and Mr. Walker had a yield sign. Therefore, the officer's report is insufficient to establish Ms. Hamilton's liability as the evidence clearly establishes that Ms. Hamilton had a green light.
The appellant's second argument in support of this assignment of error is based on an adoptive admission they allege Ms. Hamilton made at the scene of the accident.
Q. Okay. What happened after the accident?
A. Well, I got out of the car and I was a little angry and I told her, I said you run the red light and it was nothing said and we started changing insurance information.
(Emphasis added.)
Mr. Walker accused Ms. Hamilton of running the red light and appellants argue that Ms. Hamilton's failure to deny the allegation amounts to an adoptive admission. Appellants contend that this admission coupled with the officer's report *1007 should have established Ms. Hamilton's liability for the accident. According to State v. McClain, 254 La. 56, 222 So.2d 855, 856-57 (1969) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 911, 90 S.Ct. 2205, 26 L.Ed.2d 566 (1970), an adoptive admission is defined as the following:
If a statement incriminating a defendant is made by another in the defendant's presence and hearing, under circumstances where a denial, explanation, or reply would be expected and where the defendant is not in legal custody and is at full liberty to speak, evidence of that statement, and of the defendant's silence and failure to deny or explain it, may be submitted to the jury for consideration as an admission by the defendant of that statement.
However, the adoptive admission in the case referred to by the appellants occurred in a criminal context and that case is not directly on point with the facts before us. In addition, a thorough study of the record failed to reveal any references to this alleged adoptive admission at trial. During the examination of Ms. Hamilton, neither party questioned her about this admission or even made"

312,27,25522,"Today LED lighting technology is rapidly replacing traditional incandescent and fluorescent lights. Even in the tube lighting applications, instead of being filled with inert gas and mercury as found in fluorescent tube lights, the LED tube lights are mercury-free. Thus, it is no surprise that LED tube lights are becoming a highly desired illumination option among different available lighting systems used in homes and workplace, which used to be dominated by traditional lighting options such as compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) and fluorescent tube lights. Benefits of the LED tube lights include improved durability and longevity, and far less energy consumption, therefore, when taking into account of all factors, they would be considered a cost effective lighting option.
There are several types of LED tube lights that are currently available on the market today. Many of the conventional LED tube lights have a housing that uses material such as an aluminum alloy combined with a plastic cover, or made of all-plastic tube construction. The lighting sources usually adopt multiple rows of assembled individual chip LEDs (single LED per chip) being welded on circuit boards, and the circuit boards are secured to the heat dissipating housing. Because this type of aluminum alloy housing is a conductive material, thus is prone to result in electrical shock accidents to users. In addition, the light transmittance of the plastic cover or the plastic tube diminishes over time due to aging, thereby reducing the overall lighting or luminous efficiency of the conventional LED tube light. Furthermore, grainy visual appearance and other derived problems reduce the luminous efficiency, thereby reducing the overall effectiveness of the use of LED tube lights.

(CNN) On the floor of the US Senate, in full view of the American people, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff finished what Russian President Vladimir Putin started.

""The President's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won,"" Schiff thundered this week, arguing for President Donald Trump's removal.

That comment stopped me in my tracks (and rankled many in the Senate GOP conference) because the conclusion of the US intelligence community was that Russia's interference in the 2016 election was designed ""to undermine public faith in the US democratic process,"" an assessment backed up by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

What could possibly be more fulfilling of Putin's desire to sow discord and mistrust than for a senior member of Congress to stand in the well of the Senate and declare the 2020 election is already illegitimate before a single ballot has been cast?

Putin himself couldn't have scripted a better finale for his operation.

There is something revealing -- and chilling -- in Schiff's views on Trump's retrospective and prospective illegitimacy vis-à-vis the Republicans he routinely pillories for supporting the President. Schiff argues that Trump undermines our political institutions, but what could be more undermining to the Office of the Presidency than for his opposition to seemingly never accept the legitimacy of the person who occupies it?

Despite Schiff's promises, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report flatly stated that the investigation ""did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" But that has never stopped Schiff from indulging the Democratic myth that the 2016 election was stolen by the Trump campaign conspiring with a foreign government.

A majority of Republicans did not support Trump in the 2016 primary. In fact, GOP leaders raged and schemed to resist him until the end, but Trump overcame the establishment to win the nomination. Respecting the will of the voters, Republicans, unlike Democrats, ultimately accepted Trump's nomination and then his ascension to the White House.

To them, Trump won fair and square. They may not have liked it, but the system produced a result, and they respected it.

Schiff's reckless statements in the runup to the Mueller report and now this week's impeachment arguments were a continuation of the Democratic emotion to never concede the 2016 election -- and to never acknowledge the legitimacy of a man they detest. Schiff is, in effect, arguing that America's political institutions have already failed and will fail again unless a singular individual is no longer allowed to exist in the system.

As Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Tucker Carlson, if Schiff's argument is that Trump's 2016 election isn't valid -- and 2020 is likely to be no different -- ""and therefore you have to protect democracy by overturning elections... it's no wonder that they [Schiff and fellow Democrats] don't actually want to have this trial.""

Schiff exudes the faithlessness of Democrats who are sure that the basic pillars of American democracy, which have stood like immovable rocks in a stormy world for nearly 250 years, crumbled on the night that Trump was elected and cannot be rebuilt unless he is banished from the public square.

One man, they seem to say, is enough to destroy all of the faith in democracy that sprang from the genius of James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander"

323,17,9353,"“It’s fodder for Graves to use in the campaign to try and get her negatives high, and he should,” Tinklenberg’s former spokesman, John Wodele, said. “But, you know, it’s July 20 and I’m on my way up to the lake and so is every other Minnesotan. People just aren’t paying that much attention.”

Part of Graves’ messaging



Wodele is, of course, right: this race is not going to be decided by a week-long controversy during the doldrums of summer. But Graves said Bachmann’s Muslim Brotherhood flap is certain to play into one of his campaign’s overriding messages: that Bachmann’s years in D.C. have turned her into a celebrity, and she’s more interested in nurturing that image than working on behalf of the 6th District.

Article continues after advertisement

“It brings out her weakness, which is making flippant comments that are inflammatory and baseless,” Graves said in an interview. “I think it’s going to have an impact from the perspective that it reinforces all those things.”

Timing is key

Whether the flap has done enough damage for Graves to make a serious impact depends on how well he uses it going forward, Wodele said.

He doubts the campaign is going to get the traction out of this that Tinklenberg did in 2008, mostly for timing reasons. Bachmann’s MSNBC appearance came in October, just weeks before Election Day when the electorate was paying acute attention to politics. At the time, Bachmann’s national profile was comparatively low, but as her remarks went viral, Democrats rallied around her opponent, late in the game, to try and knock her out of her seat.

Now, with Minnesota airwaves quiet of political advertising and campaigns more interested in stockpiling for the fall than engaging their opponents, there just isn’t the opportunity for Graves to use the controversy to make the case against Bachmann.

“I think it will be difficult but not impossible for the Graves campaign to be able take the kind of advantage that the Tinklenberg campaign did,” Wodele said. “It’s not comparable, because of timing. Timing is everything in politics.”

But Anna Richey, Tinklenberg’s campaign manager, said the timing makes it even more important for Graves to strike now, before the Muslim Brotherhood spat falls out of voters’ memory. She said she’d go on the air with ads right now and stay there until Election Day (assuming Graves pours more of his personal wealth into the campaign), appealing to national groups like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to put the race on their radar.

Article continues after advertisement

“[The DCCC wants] to pick districts where there’s a possibly for a pick-up, but we have to take a stance against the absolute antithesis to our party values,” Richey said. “They’ve given her opportunities over and over again by coming in too late and too small.”

Still a safe seat



To be sure, Bachmann still has the advantage in this race. The 6th Congressional District is still solidly Republican, and an uphill battle for any candidate with a “D” after his name. In fact, after redistricting lopped off the eastern suburbs of St. Paul and extended the district further into the opulent western metro, it’s become more of a Republican base, and holds a Partisan Voter Index rating of R+8.

But Bachmann has never been especially strong there, at least under the old lines. She won her three elections with 50.1 (2006), 46.4 (2008) and 52.5 (2010) percent of the vote. But the district gave John McCain 53 percent of the vote in 2008; George W. Bush won it with 57 percent in 2004.

Bachmann has a massive fundraising lead over Graves ($1.7 million to $404,000) and can raise more by snapping her fingers. The Muslim Brotherhood accusations — and, more potently, the blowback from the media and the political establishment — will help rally Bachmann’s base around her.

The Cook Political Report lists the district as lean Republican in November, and its House editor, David Wasserman, said Bachmann still has edge over Graves, but warned:

“The more she dabbles toward Joe McCarthy, the more we’re starting to pay attention,” Wasserman said. “Most voters have made up their minds about"

some good feedback. Personally, when I asked how many fragments of my soul,
psyche, and energy were out there somewhere throughout eternity, there were over
a thousand, but not the several thousands the author of the article
mentioned.Needless to say, there was
some retrieving to be done, and I got right on it. As with simple soul
retrieval, I was aware that it might not be possible to retrieve all such
fragments, and there are several possible reasons that might be the case.However, addressing the issue of missing
fragments could only be beneficial. It has taken weeks, but I’m down to about
37 the last I checked.

I’ve noticed I feel different and I no longer want to
consume the same-old-same-old foods.I
still don’t have any desire for animal flesh, though (in case anyone is
wondering).I’ve also noticed that I
feel even less “at home” in this space-time/time-space than before, and that my
current apartment seems somewhat strange to me.And there are too many complications with just living. I’m more
sensitive to atrocities and related matters as reported in/by/on the media. On
the whole, this society in which I live (USA) seems unfair, cruel, and
unnatural.

However, overall, I feel lighter in body, mind, and spirit
and more powerful.Now if only 25 or so
pounds of body weight (gathered over about 15 years) would magically melt away.

When writing an email sent to someone we the Angel-Light
Team are assisting recently, the word “forgiveness” came up as a recommendation
for her—that forgiving would enhance her physical wellbeing—at least to some
degree.

When we forgive someone, it doesn’t mean one approves of
what was done or said.It means one is no
longer going to hold unforgiveness in one’s body (including energy), mind
(including soul consciousness), or spirit.Doing so will inevitably, in one way or another, hold one back from
experiencing optimal wellbeing.Now who
doesn’t want optimal wellbeing? And who among us isn’t holding at least a
little guilt over words we’ve spoken and actions we’ve taken in this life?So forgiving our own selves is important,
too.Guilt also holds us back.

Using Java generics instead of reflection to access common functionality of subclassed objects

338,22,29868,"Uber and Lyft drivers took to the roads in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau this week, newly authorized to offer rides after a bill approving the transportation network companies was signed into law.

Gov. Bill Walker signed House Bill 132 on June 15. The bill had an immediate effective date, allowing the companies to start operating as soon as it was signed. Both had dozens of pre-approved drivers ready to start.

Interest in driving for Uber drew more than 100 people in a single day to start the application process at Anchorage Chamber of Commerce headquarters on Fourth Avenue.

“The line went out the door and down the street,” said new Uber driver David O’Malley, one of the first to be approved.

He started giving rides on Friday after 3 p.m., the official launch time for Uber in Anchorage. Fairbanks followed with a 3 p.m. June 19 launch, and Juneau on June 21.

Lyft passengers will be able to use the code LYFTLOVE17 to receive $5 off their first ride, which can be entered under promo code. Scott Coriell, communications director for Lyft, said the service provides new opportunities for those looking to make extra income and it’s good for the economy in cities where they operate.

He emphasized that each driver is an independent contractor, not a Lyft employee.

Alaska, the last state to authorize transportation network companies, or TNCs, has a bit more detail planning to work the new transportation option into tourism season traffic spots. In Juneau, that process started weeks ago, even though the governor hadn’t yet signed the bill.

The concern about extra vehicles at the cramped Juneau docks was hammered out early on with Uber officials. Juneau has an unusual situation: four or five cruise ships at a time and 17,000 visitors a day disembarking for capital city excursions takes careful orchestration on the part of dock officials and transportation companies.

Add to that a tiny two-way Franklin Street as the only in-and-out of two public docks where four ships berth, and you can have chaos in no time, said Carl Uchytil, port director at Juneau Docks &Harbors. To stay ahead of potential chaos, stakeholders met at City Manager Rorie Watt’s office for a call-in meeting with Uber officials.

“In the call-in, we talked about concerns with the downtown port area and the potential for congestion,” Uchytil said. “They were accommodating, saying they would work with us as far as set locations for pickup and dropoffs. At the time, Uber didn’t know the lay-down of Juneau and how we have such a surge of traffic when cruise ships come in.”

Travel Juneau, the city’s non-profit convention and visitor’s bureau, has welcomed the transportation companies.

“We are supportive of any service that provides efficient, practical transportation for our visitors,” said Liz Perry, Travel Juneau president and executive director. “I think for Juneau in general there are times when getting taxis can be problematic. That said, I’m glad our city leadership are working with Uber and Lyft on appropriate dropoffs and pickups.”"
339,19,19992," 12 Step Recovery Groups blew the efficacy of that model apart. We have found that when staff members self-disclose by telling their stories, a mutual vulnerability and power-sharing rather than power-over dynamic is established in which honesty can be risked safely. Individuals and groups begin to share feelings openly and a sense of well-being is established.

Step Two: Encourage the Dream and Foster Imagination

Healing begins when we admit that we have been harmed and injured. Ignoring or denying that bad things have happened force the mid-brain to hang on to survival behaviors. In this second element of HCE, participants come to believe that they will no longer be defined by that harm and injury.

Most folks who have suffered chronic trauma lose the ability to dream and imagine because they are overwhelmed by a focus on crisis and survival. Hopefulness and optimism are foreign concepts when the present moment is filled with toxic stress. Healing Centered Engagement treatment creates a variety of activities which enable the participants to play, to envision a different life, and to develop attainable goals toward realizing their dreams.

One way to start dreaming and imagining again is by conducting the popular Six-Word Memoir activity in a group setting. It is a powerful tool which inspires and encourages conversations through simple and non-risky personal storytelling. The process quickly gets to the bottom of how kids or adults are experiencing their lives. It also sets up the possibility of following dreams and building imagination which contribute to well-being.

Step Three: Grasping Reality and Taking Action

This step toward healing from PTSD or DTD deals with helping individuals to consider the situations, and even community practices, which have harmed them and others. Until those who suffer from toxic stress can externalize the reasons for their trauma they continue to blame themselves. When they begin to understand that poverty, substance use disorders, mental health issues and other factors have facilitated the pain they experience, a weight is lifted. At that point"

„Körülbelül három hónapja került fel a reklám a honlapra, most kísérletezünk, hogyan lehet ezt a lehetőséget használni” – mondta a Direkt36-nak Földvári Gábor, az Innozone tulajdonosa. A cég reklámjai szerint 80 ezer eurós (26,1 millió forintos) ingatlanbefektetésért lehet tartózkodási engedélyt szerezni, Földvári szerint azonban a tartózkodási engedély kiadása minden esetben a Bevándorlási Hivatal mérlegelésén múlik és nincs szabályozva, hogy pontosan mekkora összegű befektetésért cserébe járnak magyar papírok.

„Mi azt mondjuk, hogy 80 ezer euró alatt nem érdemes kezdeni semmit, de inkább pár százezer eurós ingatlanbefektetést ajánlunk az ügyfeleknek” – mondta Földvári. „A magyar lehetőséget ezért nem is annyira hirdetjük, jelenleg csak két ügyféllel tárgyalunk. Elsősorban inkább Spanyolország, Görögország és Portugália ingatlanbefektetési lehetőségeit javasoljuk, ahol pontosan szabályozott program működik.”

Ha valaki a magyar ingatlanbefektetést választja, az Innozone összeköti a befektetőt egy ingatlanközvetítő céggel, és 55-65 ezer euró ügyvédi díjért pedig vállalja a magyar tartózkodási engedéllyel kapcsolatos ügyintézést (ha nem sikerül tartózkodási engedélyt szerezni, az összeg nagy része visszajár a befektetőnek). „Több ügyvéddel dolgozunk együtt” – mondta Földvári, és azt is megjegyezte, hogy a korábban Rogánt is képviselő, és a kötvényprogramban többek közt az Innozone-nal is dolgozó Kosik Kristóf irodája „éppen nincs az ügyvédek között”.

344,0,3696,"About 100 people gathered at the School of Image Arts last Tuesday for the new building’s official opening, with an open bar and hors d’oeuvres such as stuffed tomatoes and sliders. The renovation changed the exterior brick to glass and added LED lights to the outside walls. President Sheldon Levy and vice-president academic Alan Shepard gave speeches, hinting at the delays that displaced image arts students around campus for about a year longer than expected. People were smiling, laughing and enjoying the night, most of them glad the project is finally nearing its end.

Some students, however, are unhappy with their new academic home. They see little difference inside the building after the renovation. Some image arts (IMA) students are disappointed with the changes and don’t feel it was worth the time they spent displaced around campus.

“I expected a lot more to be changed given the time they took,” said Emily Goode, a fourth-year IMA student in an email. “The first floor is the only one that they fully renovated.”

The $71-million building project took about three years to complete. During that time, students used alternative facilities off-campus, and in Kerr Hall, the Victoria Building and the Rogers Communications Centre.

Although Goode said it was inconvenient, she didn’t mind using the other facilities. Still, she felt that the building improvements could have been more suited to the needs of students.

She’s not the only one. “The move out wasn’t that bad because we were all expecting this wicked building,” said Lukas Sluzar, a fourth-year IMA student. “But when we got back, we found that it was pretty much the exact same building. So a lot of us were pretty disappointed.”

The building project was a part of Ryerson’s Master Plan, an initiative to re-utilize campus space. The plan included construction of a gallery and research centre. The first exhibition to be showcased is Ryerson’s Black Star

Historical Black & White Photography Collection. The collection of 250,000 photographs, anonymously donated in 2005, was given to the school on the understanding that Ryerson would build a professional gallery to house it.

The gallery is still incomplete but is expected to open in September 2012.

“The building was really about the gallery,” said Alex Anderson, chair of image arts. “The focus of the design was how to add a world-class gallery... in an already built construction.”

Just under half of the funding for the project came from grants and the rest came from internal sources and donations.

Even with all the planning and announcements from the school, the lack of upgrades and improved facilities disappointed students. The fourth-year students are the only current students who have used the old building.

“The hallways were the exact same so I knew how to navigate around,” said Sluzar.

Some students felt the money could have been better spent.

“There are things image arts needs and a new coat of paint with some green tile and a glowing building are not on that list,” said Goode. “I would much rather have another studio space or spend the renovation money on new equipment.”

Anderson said that Ryerson didn’t dip into the equipment budget to fund the renovation.

Julia Hanigsberg, vice-president of administration and finance, said that the $32.9 million grant money went directly to fund improvements for the image arts program, not the gallery. “A major part of (the renovation) was the re-cladding of the building, bringing light into the building,” she said. She also said that renovations made the building more wheelchair accessible.

Even though the outside of the building was improved, the interior of the building only saw an increase in windows, study spaces and the addition of a gallery.

The new building, which is 14,000 square feet bigger, will have a new coffee shop — Balzac’s — scheduled to open next week.

However, Anderson said she understands IMA students’ disappointment with the lack of upgraded"

In three brief addresses to groups affiliated with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), an agency of the United Nations in Rome, the pope spoke about the need to react to environmental degradation with a change in lifestyles.

“Indigenous peoples are a living cry in favor of hope,” Francis said. “They remind us that human beings have a shared responsibility to care for our ‘common home.’ And if certain decisions made so far have spoiled it, it is never too late to learn the lesson and acquire a new lifestyle.”

“It is a matter of adopting a way of acting that, leaving behind superficial approaches and harmful habits, overcomes atrocious individualism, convulsive consumerism and cold selfishness,” he said.

Francis has distinguished himself for his attention to environmental issues such as global warming and carbon dioxide emissions, becoming the first pope to devote an entire encyclical letter to the care of the environment.

This purpose is achieved with the spacer as initially defined in that a plurality of said deflecting members comprises a vane which extends in a direction from a cell into the neighbouring flow channel, wherein the vane is inclined relative to a vertical plane and wherein the vane is wider in its upper part that in its lower part.
In the upper part of the fuel assembly where a considerable amount of the cooling medium (water) has been converted into steam, the remaining part of the cooling medium exists as a film on the surfaces of the fuel rods and as drops in the steam flow. If the film of the cooling medium is not maintained, an isolating steam layer is formed which leads to a quick increase in temperature and to a destroyed enclosure of the fuel, a so-called dryout. A way of improving the film of the cooling medium with the help of drops in the steam flow improves the margin against dryout and has a considerable economical value and a considerable value for safety reasons.
It has become apparent that with the previously known spacers, different vortices may be formed at different edges of the projecting deflecting members or at different deflecting members in the flow channel. These different vortex formations may disturb or act against each other. This may lead to the effect that the cooling medium is not efficiently deflected towards the fuel rods. The steam which is formed around the fuel rods is therefore not substituted by the cooling medium. Steam therefore stays around the fuel rods which, as has been described above, leads to an increased risk for a dryout. That is, the dryout performance of the reactor becomes"

We shall send you in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns. That is our purpose and our pledge.""

352,19,15498,"^2(M)$ is called *symplectic* if it is nondegenerate and $d\omega=0$. The nondegeneracy assumption means that the bundle map $$\label{eq:omegab}
\omega^\sharp: TM \to T^*M,\;\; X \mapsto i_X\omega,$$ is an isomorphism; in local coordinates, writing $\omega =
\frac{1}{2}\omega_{ij} dx^i\wedge dx^j$, this amounts to the pointwise invertibility of the matrix $(\omega_{ij})$. The pair $(M,\omega)$, where $\omega$ is a symplectic 2-form, is called a *symplectic manifold*.

The basic ingredients of the hamiltonian formalism on a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ are as follows. For any function $f\in
C^\infty(M)$, there is an associated *hamiltonian vector field* $X_f \in \mathcal{X}(M)$, uniquely defined by the condition $$\label{eq:hamvf}
i_{X_f}\omega = df.$$ In other words, $X_f = (\omega^\sharp)^{-1}(df)$. There is an induced bilinear operation $$\{\cdot,\cdot\}: C^\infty(M)\times C^\infty(M)\to C^\infty(M),$$ known as the *Poisson bracket*, that measures the rate of change of a function $g$ along the hamiltonian flow of a function $f$, $$\label{eq:pbrk}
\{f,g\} := \omega(X_g,X_f)={\mathcal L}_{X_f}g.$$ The Poisson bracket is skew-symmetric, and one verifies from its definition that $$\label{eq:ident}
d\omega(X_f,X_g,X_h) = \{f,\{g,h\}\} + \{h,\{f,g\}\} +
\{g,\{h,f\}\};$$ it follows that the Poisson bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity, since $\omega$ is closed. The pair $(C^\infty(M),\{\cdot,\cdot\})$ is a *Poisson algebra*, i.e., $\{\cdot,\cdot\}$ is a Lie bracket on $C^\infty(M)$ that is compatible with the associative commutative product on $C^\infty(M)$ via the Leibniz rule: $$\{f, gh\} = \{f,g\} h + \{f,h\} g.$$

It results from the Leibniz rule that the Poisson bracket is defined by a bivector field $\pi \in \Gamma(\wedge^2TM)$, uniquely determined by $$\label{eq:pi}
\pi(df,dg)=\{f,g\} = \omega(X_g,X_f);$$ we write it locally as $$\label{eq:localp}
\pi = \frac{1}{2}\pi^{ij}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x^i}}\wedge
\frac{\partial}{\partial{x^j}}.$$

The bivector field $\pi$ defines a bundle map $$\label{eq:pisharp}

Apart from improving upon the previous best known complexity for distributed $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for minimum weight vertex cover and providing a new way of adapting the sequential local ratio technique to the distributed setting, our algorithm has the consequence of contradicting the lower bound of [@KMW10]. The latter states that a constant approximation algorithm requires $\Omega(\log{\Delta})$ rounds. Its refutation implies that the current lower bound is $\Omega(\log{\Delta}/\log\log{\Delta})$ from [@KMW04], which means that our algorithm is tight.

In Section \[sec:refutation\] we pinpoint the flaw in the lower bound of [@KMW10]. This also includes refuting the second result of [@KMW10], which is a lower bound in terms of $n$, of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}})$ rounds for a constant approximation algorithm. Roughly speaking, we claim that the statement of the main theorem is only correct for some smaller range of parameters than claimed, and hence, in particular, one cannot apply it for a number of rounds that is $\Theta(\log{\Delta})$ or $\Theta(\sqrt{\log{n}})$. We emphasize that, as far as we are aware, this bug *does not* occur in the previous version of the lower bound [@KMW04], implying that the current lower bounds are $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}/\log\log{n}})$ in terms of $n$, and $\Omega(\log{\Delta}/\log\log{\Delta})$ in terms of $\Delta$.

There’s no on/off switch but once you plug it in a solid blue light on the front of the transmitter tells you that you’re powered up and everything’s OK.

An indicator light is an important feature to look for in a pet fence because it tells you that everything is working before you open the door and let your dog out. And with this wireless fence transmitter, one peek will tell you everything you need to know.

From there you only have 2 controls to set:

Boundary Switch: Controls the strength of the signal and is set according to how large you want your coverage area to be.

Boundary Control Dial: This is used to fine tune the size of your circular containment area.

There’s a handy reference chart in the manual that will help you determine where to set the boundary switch and boundary control dial in order to get just the right size containment area for your dog.

And that’s it — adjust 2 controls and you’re ready to go. It just doesn’t get any easier than this PetSafe instant fence!

It’s also worth noting that the Stay and Play’s transmitter has a couple of alarms that you won’t find on the PIF-300:

How To Use The Stay and Play PetSafe Wireless Fence Collar

The PIF00-12918 receiver collar comes standard with the Stay and Play and fits neck sizes of 6″-23″.

The collar weighs in at about 2.9 oz and its receiver unit measures 1.5″ long X 1.3″ tall X 2.5″ wide. How light it is and how small the receiver unit is are the two things that ensure this electronic dog collar is comfortable for dogs as tiny as 5 lbs.

Although it’s OK to get the 12918 collar wet, submerging it for any length of time can damage it. So if you have one of those lovable canines who likes to dive after things, it’s best to take the collar off before they go into the water.

Without a doubt one of the things people love most about this wireless dog collar is that it’s rechargeable. Charging the collar is straight forward and here’s what the reviews have to say about the charging process:

It takes about 2-3 hrs to fully charge the collar

The charge lasts about 3 weeks on average, depending on how often the collar is activated

The mode button turns the collar on or off and it’s also the button you’ll use to set your dog’s level of static correction. Turning the collar off when it’s not in use will preserve the life of the battery.

Once the collar is turned on there’s an indicator light that will let you know the status of your battery. An indicator light is an essential feature on a receiver collar because it tells you, at a glance, how much juice your battery has.

With the PetSafe Stay and Play collar you’ll know just by the color of the light whether or not your dog’s receiver collar is good to go or needs recharging. If the battery does need to be recharged this light acts as a low battery warning and flashes red.

As long as each dog has their own collar, the Stay and Play wireless system can accommodate an unlimited number of dogs. And if you have more than one dog you won’t necessarily need to buy an extra charger because the charging adapter allows you to charge 2 collars at once.

The 12918 receiver collar is made out of durable nylon material and the receiver unit is a ‘pass through’ type. That’s a really nice feature because it means that when the material wears out you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a completely new collar; you simply transfer the receiver unit onto any non metallic collar of your choosing, as long as it’s at least 3/4″ wide.

360,29,4226,"National Bible Bee

The National Bible Bee is a Bible contest held for the first time in 2009 by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation. The competition starts with local contests across the United States.The top 120 contestants from each age group (Primary, ages 7–10; Junior, ages 11–14; Senior, ages 15–18) advance to the National level. The top 120 contestants are decided by a test that is based on the book the contestants studied during the summer. The first national competition was held in Washington, D.C. on November 5–6, 2009. More than $100,000 in prize money is awarded each year.

Origins and philosophy 
The National Bible Bee is sponsored by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation. Shelby Kennedy, who died of cancer at the age of 23, spent her life studying the Bible and proclaiming Christ. After her death, The Shelby Kennedy Foundation, was established as a non-profit in her name to encouraging children and youth to memorize Scripture.

The National Bible Bee promises large cash prizes for nine of the top-place finalists. Both the local and national competition involve oral and written tests. The goal of the Bible Bee is to encourage young people in the Christian faith, by becoming more biblically literate. Their vision is ""To know God's Word and make Him known.""

Competition 
Competition is divided into local and national levels. From 2009 to 2014, the local competition was not administrated directly by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation, but rather by separate entities known as Hosts. Though these groups were not legally related to the Shelby Kennedy Foundation, they were the only source of finalists for the national competition. At the local competition, the contestants were required to take a written test and an oral test. From 2015 and on, the orals test was taken off, and the written test was replaced with an online test on Classmarker. The Hosts remained, but they acted as supporter of the competition rather than direct administrators of the competition. At the end of the local competition, the total scores were compiled and the highest-scoring contestants in each age category proceed to the national competition. In 2009, National Bible Bee was held at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Washington, D.C.. The 2010 competition was held at the Marriott Renaissance Hotel and Conference Center in Schaumburg, Illinois.
The 2011 National Bible Bee was held in Nashville, Tennessee, and the 2012 and 2013 National Bible Bee was held at the Wilderness Stone Hill Lodge and Sevierville Events Center in Sevierville, Tennessee. The 2014 National Bible Bee competition was held in Orlando, Florida at the Hilton Orlando Lake Buena Vista. It was announced in the spring of 2015 that the National competitions of 2015, 2016, and 2017 would be held at the J.W. Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa in San Antonio, TX. The 2018 National Competition was held at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, December 3-7. The 2019 National Competition was held at the Northern Kentucky Convention Center, in Covington, Kentucky, November 18–21. The final rounds were held at the Ark Encounter Answer Center.  The 2020 National Bible Bee will be held in Covington, Kentucky.

Eligibility 
Eligibility for the National Bible Bee is restricted to United States citizens, including residents of the District of Columbia and children of U.S. Armed Forces personnel stationed overseas.  Non-legal residents may compete on the local level but may not advance to the National competition. Close relatives of the Shelby Kennedy Foundation members or others who have worked on the contest content are allowed to compete; however, they may not win prize money at the National Bible Bee Competition.

Contestants are divided into three age divisions: Primary (ages 7–10), Junior (ages 11–14) and Senior (ages 15–18). Ages are based on the contestant's age on November 13 of the year of the competition.

Study materials 
The Bible Bee's competition material includes both memory work and an in-depth study on a selected book or portion of the Bible.

Contestants are required to memorize a number of verses. In the preliminary oral round, the contestants must recite the passages they are asked word-for-word from any of five approved English versions (NIV, KJV, NKJV, NASB, or ESV). Scores are given based on the accuracy of the contestant's recitation. In addition, comprehension of the memory verses is tested in a multiple-choice computer-based test.

Bible knowledge 
In 2009, all the contestants were to study Genesis, 1 & 2 Samuel, Matthew, Acts, and Romans.  

Starting in 2010, all contestants received a Discovery Journal, which is a study guide for a single book or passage of the Bible. Comprehension of this book of the Bible is tested through an online test. Parents receive a Parent Guide"
361,28,12611,"9th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery

The 9th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery is an artillery regiment of the Australian Army. It draws lineage from an artillery unit raised in 1903, which provided personnel to artillery units raised for service during World War I seeing action on the Western Front. It was mobilised for service during World War II and undertook defensive duties in Australia before being disbanded in 1944. The regiment was re-raised as part of the Australian Army Reserve in 2018, and currently provides artillery support to the 2nd Division. It consists of six light batteries, which are based at numerous depots around the country. The regiment's headquarters is based in Sydney, New South Wales.

History
The regiment draws its lineage from the 4th Artillery Brigade that was formed on 1 July 1903 at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. During the First World War, a large number of the unit's personnel volunteered with the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force and in 1914 a large cadre of trained personnel were provided to the 1st Field Artillery Brigade, which was assigned to the 1st Division. This unit went on to serve at Gallipoli and on the Western Front.  The 9th Field Artillery Brigade, consisting of the 33rd, 34th and 35th Field Batteries, and the 118th Field Howitzer Battery, was also raised in 1916 for service on the Western Front, as part of the 3rd Division. The current regiment claims lineage with this unit. The 3rd Division undertook training in the United Kingdom in mid- to late-1916, before deploying to the Western Front in December 1916; as a result, it missed the fighting on the Somme. Shortly after the division's arrival, the 9th Field Artillery Brigade was disbanded in mid-January 1917 when the decision was made to consolidate the number of guns within each battery and reduce the number of artillery brigades in each division.

In 1921, after the AIF was demobilised, Australia's part-time military forces were reorganised. At this time, the 9th Field Brigade was raised at Paddington, assigned to the 2nd Division, and served throughout the interwar years as part of the Militia.

During the Second World War, the 2/9th Field Regiment was raised as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force. This unit undertook active service in the Middle East and undertook garrison duties in Australia.  Meanwhile, the separate 9th Field Brigade was reorganised as the 9th Field Regiment in February 1941, initially consisting of the 19th and 20th Batteries. It was mobilised for defensive duties in December 1941 after Japan's entry into the war. Around this time, the regiment was assigned to the 1st Division. Initially, the two batteries were deployed to support the 28th Brigade around Wollongong and the 9th Brigade defending the northern beaches around Sydney. A third battery – the 21st – was raised in January 1942, and after the regiment was relieved of its defensive positions, it concentrated at Wallgrove and undertook training under the command of the 2nd Division.

After this, the regiment was returned to the 1st Division, and the defensive plan changed, resulting in the regimental headquarters moved to St Ives, and the batteries deployed to support the 9th Brigade. The regiment was moved several times during the final months of 1942, firstly to Pymble and then Largs, and early the following year the 19th Battery supported amphibious warfare training at Port Stephens. A number of personnel were transferred at this time to the 1st Field Regiment and the 2nd Mountain Battery for service in New Guinea. Meanwhile, the regiment continued home service, providing training to underage soldiers before they were posted to operational units. The 20th Battery was detached and converted into a depot battery for the School of Artillery at Holsworthy, and in December 1943 the regiment moved to Dapto. They remained there until May 1944 when they moved to Narellan. The regiment was disbanded there in April 1944, while the 20th Battery was disbanded at Holsworthy after being relieved by the 53rd Battery.

The regiment was re-raised on 15 January 2018 to provide a regimental headquarters for all Australian Army Reserve mortar-equipped light batteries assigned to the 2nd Division. To mark the event, a formal ceremony was held at Victoria Barracks in Sydney on 14 April 2018.  The same month, the Kogarah City Council announced that they would grant the regiment Freedom of Entry to the city in 2019. Headquartered at Sydney, the regiment currently commands six light batteries: the 2nd/10th, 3rd, 5th/11th, 6th/13th,"
362,28,23434,"The National Fenestration Ratings Council Takes on the Window
Film Industryby Penny Beverage

Two years ago, the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC), which is based in Silver Spring, Md., considered adding window film to the list of products it rates
(see March-April 2001 Window Film, page
6). However, the association did not complete the task at the time and it seemed that it might postpone the endeavor indefinitely.

However, the time finally has come, and the window film industry now must face the new standards imposed on it by the
NFRC.

The NFRC recently announced that it has approved a new technical procedure for rating window film (along with screens) when it met in Scottsdale, Ariz., June 8-12, 2003, at the Camelback Inn Marriott Resort. NFRC will begin to develop the certification and labeling procedures at its upcoming task group meetings in Kansas City, Mo., to be held September 18-19.

“NFRC is committed to improving our existing rating procedures and to expanding the universe of products that manufacturers can bring to us for fair, accurate and credible energy performance ratings,” said Tony Rygg, NFRC chair, as he made the announcement. “We appreciate the effort made by window film manufacturers to work with us to develop technical procedures that will eventually allow them to rate and certify their film products through
NFRC.”

Who’s the Stranger?
Many may wonder, what is the NFRC, and what business does it have rating window film?
The NFRC is a non-profit, public/private organization created by the window, door and skylight industry. Its membership list currently includes manufacturers, suppliers, builders, architects and designers, specifiers, code officials, utility companies and government agencies.

However, most of the major window film manufacturers have little to no involvement with the council, though the International Window Film Association (IWFA), which is based in Martinsville, Va., is a member, and says it supports its own members’ interests at NFRC meetings. In addition, St. Louis-based Solutia Inc., which owns CPFilms Inc., is a member of the council.

Despite the small number of film manufacturers on the council, Darrell Smith, executive director of the IWFA and a member of the Association of Industrial Metallizers, Coaters and Laminators’ window film committee (AIMCAL WFC), said he and the AIMCAL WFC have been involved in the development process since the idea came about.

“About four years ago, it was suggested to me by NFRC and [Department of Energy] contacts that our industry needed to have a more proactive role in helping NFRC embrace technologies other than conventional glass/window combinations,” Smith said."

Polyurethanes are among the most used polymers due to their wide range of properties. Their versatility allows the synthesis of different materials such as foams, coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers. Applications can be found in fields like automotive industry, footwear, in construction as insulators, and, most recently, in medical devices. Polyurethanes are synthesized by reaction of an isocyanate, generally a polymeric isocyanate, with a polyol. As the synthesis of isocyanates is more complex than that of polyols, investigations usually focus on new bio-based polyols to reduce the PU carbon footprint while relying on synthetic isocyanates \[[@B30-polymers-11-00480],[@B31-polymers-11-00480]\]. Various foams based on bio-based materials have been prepared and characterized in the last years \[[@B32-polymers-11-00480],[@B33-polymers-11-00480],[@B34-polymers-11-00480]\]. Bio-based polyols offer a wide range of properties and, thus, the properties of the final material strongly depend on the polyol used \[[@B35-polymers-11-00480],[@B36-polymers-11-00480]\]. The environmental sustainability \[[@B37-polymers-11-00480],[@B38-polymers-11-00480]\] and the low cost render these materials environmentally friendly competitors of current synthetic polymers \[[@B39-polymers-11-00480],[@B40-polymers-11-00480],[@B41-polymers-11-00480]\]. However, bio-based foams generally have lower resistance to environmental degradation than synthetic polyurethane \[[@B42-polymers-11-00480]\]. In addition, almost no natural products are available as a substitute for synthetic UV stabilizers. In this respect, tannin can be employed as a reactive polyhydroxyl filler to prepare polyurethane composite foams; this is thanks to its chemical structure, alongside the aforementioned UV stabilizing properties. In fact, Ge et al. \[[@B43-polymers-11-00480]\] reported that the phenolic hydroxyl groups present on the B-ring of tannin ([Figure 1](#polymers-11-00480-f001){ref-type=""fig""}) are able to react with the isocyanatic group due to the higher electron densities on the oxygen atoms present in the B-ring compared to those in the A-ring.

In this work, the synthesis of polyurethane-based composite foams by using methylene diphenyl isocyanate (isocyanate source), ethoxylated cocoalkyl amine (polyol), and condensed tannins (as a UV stabilizer and additional --OH source) in the presence of a suitable amount of water (as a blowing agent), catalysts, and silicone surfactant was investigated. Different foam formulations were prepared to evaluate the effects of tannin and water contents on the foaming kinetics, mechanical properties, and foam morphology. The foams were exposed to accelerated degradation cycles, simulated by exposure to UV radiation, and the effects on the chemical and mechanical properties were evaluated.

366,6,7134,"Jason Isaacs has urged fans not to give up (Picture: Netflix)

The OA has been one of the most wickedly haunting pieces of science fiction to hit our screens since forever, and Netflix’s controversial decision to axe the show has been harrowing for both fans and Jason Isaacs himself.

Netflix left us all hanging at the edge of our seats with our hearts beating out of our chest when season two of the supernatural drama came to an end and we all thought it would be a matter of time before we got the answers we needed.

That wasn’t the case, clearly.

After the streaming platform cancelled the cult-classic series, people reacted with raw emotions in hopes of saving the show the same way Sense8 got their closure as a film and Brooklyn Nine-Nine got a whole new network, thus birthing the hashtag #SaveTheOA.




A Save The OA billboard in Times Square marking the latest attempt to change the streaming giant bosses’ minds was erected and Jason – who plays Dr. Hap – was in New York to witness all of it.

‘We’re all incredibly moved and thrilled that the story is so powerful,’ the 56-year-old exclusively told Metro.co.uk.

‘And those characters and their humanity has touched people so much that there is a movement.

‘I’ve met some of the people who did it. I was in New York and there was a flash mob and a billboard and a blimp. It’s incredibly touching. I love the story, I think it’s a really powerful, special, really unique story.’

‘He falls in love with one of them and hopes she can step outside the situation and love him back’ (Picture: Netflix)

In a way, Jason and the entire team behind the incredible series are relying on fans to use their voices to bring back such a meaningful work of art.

Even if Netflix stand by their decision, know that Jason and every one part of the show is listening.

‘I don’t know if we’ll get to carry on. All of us are very moved by the fan movement. If you can make it happen, if we get to make more we’ll be thrilled! But obviously we"
367,28,25976,"This invention relates generally to toner image creation and more particularly to developability control which enables a wider usable A.sub.t (i.e. a toner material's effectiveness in charging with a given carrier) range.
The invention can be utilized in the art of xerography. In the practice of conventional xerography, it is the general procedure to form electrostatic latent images on a xerographic surface by first uniformly charging a photoreceptor. The photoreceptor comprises a charge retentive surface. The charge is selectively dissipated in accordance with a pattern of activating radiation corresponding to original images. The selective dissipation of the charge leaves a latent charge pattern on the imaging surface corresponding to the areas not exposed by radiation.
A common type of developer comprises carrier granules having toner particles adhering triboelectrically thereto. The two-component mixture is brought into contact with the photoconductive surface, where the toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules to the latent image. This forms a toner powder image on the photoconductive surface which is subsequently transferred to a copy sheet. The developed image is then fixed to the imaging surface or is transferred to a receiving substrate such as plain paper to which it is fixed by suitable fusing techniques.
In most two component development processes, the developer/toner materials are at the mercy of the development housing design: auger configuration, sump geometry, magnetic brush roll size, magnetics design, roll and auger velocity, etc. to cause tribocharging of the toner against the carrier. The auger speeds and roll velocities are usually adjusted to provide adequate flow balancing of the developer within the housing and developability that provides ample operating latitude, respectively. Once these speeds are determined, the level of tribocharging of the toner against the carrier is fixed. Hence, to modify the tribocharging, the formulation of the materials are adjusted to provide the desired tribocharging performance.
In conventional two-component xerographic development, the ability of a toner material to charge with a given carrier material is quantified as follows: EQU A.sub.t =Tribo*(TC+C.sub.0)
where Tribo is the average charge to mass ratio of toner, TC is the toner concentration in percent by weight, and C.sub.0 is a constant. A.sub.t is a critical specification parameter for toner and developer; it tends to vary from batch to batch, with developer age, and with operating relative humidity. The variation with humidity is a special problem with many color toners, since this variation tends to be much larger than with comparable black toners. In general, the higher the A.sub.t, the better the material charging.
Modification of the developer A.sub.t by changing the material's formulation is a long process whereby the materials must be subjected to a significant amount of both bench and lengthy and expensive full process experiments before they can be qualified for satisfactory use in a product. Also, when a product like the 4850 printer, for example, has more than one color toner, it is desirable to maintain commonality in the carrier formulation so as to minimize cost.

Located in the centre of Australia, Alice Springs enjoys an almost legendary status. A frontier town surrounded by vast deserts, “Alice” is a complex mix of Aboriginal and European colonial history. The stepping-off point for outback adventures, this cosmopolitan town has become a destination in its own right, with a bustling arts scene, rich cultural life and plenty to do."
370,28,29272,"The idea of establishing the “Concord of Orthodox Youth” movement was born even before the reunification of the two branches of the Russian Orthodox Church, and was incarnated after the Ascension of the Lord in 2007, with the active participation of His Holiness Patriarch Alexy II and His Eminence Metropolitan Laurus of Eastern America and New York, First Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. This year’s conference is now the fourth of its kind, and was organized with the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill.

The Concord is called upon, in the words of His Holiness, “to foster feelings of unity and integration within the young generation of Orthodox Christians who live in various countries and belong to various Local Churches.” For this end, an international medium is being created for Orthodox youth, and young Orthodox men and women, descendants of Russian emigres, are given the opportunity to have contact with Russian spiritual traditions and culture. Concord also has a missionary goal—to show the allure and beauty of the Orthodox way of life, to witness a different possible way of life in"

OM increases myofilament Ca-sensitivity for motor attachment {#Sec5}

As \[Ca^2+^\] decreases, the depressant effect of OM on *T*~0~ also decreases. As shown in Fig. [3a](#Fig3){ref-type=""fig""}, at pCa between 4.5 and 6.5, *T*~0~ is lower in OM (open circles) than in control (filled circles), while at pCa \> 7 *T*~0~ is higher in OM. Fitting the data with the Hill equation shows that pCa~50~ (the pCa at which force attains half-maximum) increases from 6.57 in the control (continuous line) to 7.02 in the presence of OM (dashed line) (Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type=""table""}), indicating a corresponding increase in Ca^2+^-sensitivity of the force. At the same time the slope of the relation, estimated by the parameter *n* of the Hill equation, which is an indicator of the degree of cooperativity in myofilament activation, decreases from 2.01 in the control to 0.84 in the presence of OM.Table 2Parameters of Hill's equation fit to force-pCa relation in control and in the presence of OM.Control1 μM OM*n*2.01 ± 0.140.84 ± 0.15pCa~50~6.57 ± 0.017.02 ± 0.07*n* estimates the slope of the relation, pCa~50~ (the pCa at which force attains half-maximum) estimates the Ca^2+^ sensitivity.

![Changes in the chemical shifts of the 9MA-based NH6 proton of **1**^3+^ (concentration of hexafluorophasphate salt: 1.75 mM l^--1^ of host dissolved in d^3^-MeCN) on addition of the following selected anions: ClO~4~^--^ (×), I^--^ (▲), Br^--^ (□), Cl^--^ (), and F^--^ (). The data for the fluoride titration is truncated as higher binding ratios lead to precipitation of the host.](c4sc02799j-f3){#fig3}

The largest shift -- of 3.651 ppm -- is observed with fluoride ion; these shifts reflect the high polarizing effect of fluoride anion, indeed at higher mixing ratios still -- at which precipitation begins to occur and the NH6 proton signal considerably broadens -- it is clear that the host is at least partly deprotonated. Job plots using the NMR changes revealed that receptor **1**^3+^ binds to all the anionic guests investigated in a 1 : 1 ratio -- Fig. S4 in the ESI.[†](#fn1){ref-type=""fn""} Given this stoichiometry, and the pattern of shifting for the 9MA-based protons, we conclude that in solution anion guests are bound within the β pocket of the host. Support for this conclusion is also provided by large shifts in thiacrown-based protons.

The changes for \[9\]aneS~3~ protons are more complex with up and downfield shifts being observed. The crystal structure data shows close contacts between some ethylene protons of the thiacrown ligands and anionic guests; the strength of this interaction is reflected in the downfield shifting of these protons. However, a second effect also affects the thiacrown-based signals. Due to sterics, binding to this site will reduce the conformational flexibility of the coordinated thiacrowns and concomitantly increase the rigidity of the receptor; this effect will be greatest for protons on the interior of the binding pocket. A close inspection confirms this hypothesis revealing that -- due to decreased fluxionality -- several multiplets split into simpler signals as shown in Fig. S5[†](#fn1){ref-type=""fn""} for chloride. Again, these effects are dependent on the nature of the guest: for perchlorate the biggest shift in thiacrown signals is around 0.15 ppm, while changes of almost 0.5 ppm are observed in titrations with iodide.

Using NH resonances shifts to fit to a standard 1 : 1 binding model, association constants were calculated -- [Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=""table""}. The data reveal that **1**^3+^ binds to Cl^--^ and Br^--^ up to almost three orders of magnitude more strongly than other ions and that Cl^--^ is bound with the highest affinity (*K*~a~ \> 10^5^ M^--1^). The values for Cl^--^ and Br^--^ are likely to be lower limits as -- due to the concentration regime employed -- NMR titrations only provide accurate estimates of *K*~a~ for weak or intermediate interactions. Absorption spectroscopy-based titrations were not possible as no guest-induced little change in macrocycle spectrum was observed.

Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Ghana is still a big problem as the WHO puts the current MMR estimates at 319 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births \[[@B1]\]. The current situation shows that a lot more have to be made in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal-3 (SDG-3) \[[@B2]\].

Though facility-based deliveries in Ghana have increased from 42% in 1988 to 73% in 2014, skilled delivery care service utilization is still below set targets. The 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) indicated that nearly three-quarters of births (74.0%) in Ghana occurred with the assistance of a skilled health professional.

Efforts to make skilled birth services available to pregnant women in Ghana started in 2005 when the Government of Ghana implemented a number of social interventions including the nationwide free maternal health services policy, the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), and the Maternal Healthcare Program \[[@B3]\].

Battle entered a plea of “true” to violating Condition No. 5A. Battle explained he did not attend

orientation as required because he took his wife to the hospital immediately following court on

October 1, 2015. The State provided testimony that it attempted to contact Battle at the phone

number he provided, leaving a voicemail. Battle testified he did not receive the message because

he no longer had the phone number he provided to the probation official. Based on Battle’s plea,

the trial court found Battle’s violation of Condition No. 5A, as alleged in the State’s motion, to be

true and revoked Battle’s community supervision, sentencing him to eighteen months’

confinement in a state jail facility. Battle timely appealed.

preponderance of the evidence, the defendant violated a term or condition of his community

supervision. Rickels v. State, 202 S.W.3d 759, 763-64 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). The State meets

its burden when the greater weight of the evidence creates a reasonable belief that the defendant

Mark Karlin: In Chapter Fourteen, you have a specific anecdote regarding [Nevada Democratic Sen.] Harry Reid and an aide explaining why the majority leader in the Senate wouldn’t launch a populist campaign against Wall Street. Will you recount the revealing exchange?

Jeff Connaughton: I asked a Reid staffer why Reid wasn’t using Wall Street reform as a campaign issue in Nevada against his Republican opponent in 2010, since it polled so well. Basically, the answer I got back was that Reid’s campaign already had raised so much money from Wall Street that it had compromised his ability to take a populist stance before his campaign leadership had even considered it as a political strategy.

Mark Karlin: What’s the bottom line on why you believe no high-ranking executives were prosecuted by the Obama Department of Justice for illegal financial behavior that led to the 2007-2008 crash of the US and international economies?

Jeff Connaughton: The bottom line is, if you had a different type of attorney general, deputy attorney general and assistant attorney general for the criminal division, I think you would have seen a far more proactive, timely, better organized and better resourced Wall Street investigation. But President Obama picked his people, and he’s known for at least two years that there were valid concerns about the passive approach the Justice Department leadership had adopted. In 2010, I called a friend in the White House who was in a position to know and asked, “What’s going on over at the Justice Department?” He said, “No one over there is making it a priority.” You can’t pretend the Justice Department is some “hands off” autonomous agency.

Mary Jo White at her confirmation hearings admitted she talked to Larry Summers before indicting a Japanese bank in the 1990s. These high-level officials at the White House, Justice Department and Treasury talk to each other all the time. Obama should have told Holder to kick some ass, not in the direction of a particular target, which would have been entirely inappropriate, but to ensure the resources and priority were top drawer. Because he never did (and perhaps didn’t want to), no one can ever say whether a competent, concerted, purposeful and timely investigation of Wall Street executives might have led to criminal convictions.

Mark Karlin: You got your start on the Hill through your support of Joe Biden in his ill-fated campaign for president in 1988. You ended up on his staff. Yet, threaded through your book are criticisms of and disappointment in him. He comes off as a self-centered blowhard and a friend to the credit card companies headquartered in Wilmington, Virginia.

Jeff Connaughton: I wanted to write an honest account of my career, exactly as I experienced it. I also wrote that Biden has many excellent qualities; people tend to skip over that. But the truth is, I was deeply disappointed that Biden didn’t play a role in the aftermath of the financial crisis, nor did he mentor me into a position where I could keep working on these issues, somewhere in government. It was all Geithner and Holder (and Obama). You know, solving a banking crisis and its devastating effects on the American economy wasn’t the reason that either Obama or Biden ever ran for president, but it’s a primary reason why their ticket got elected and, in my view, has been the central (neglected) issue of their time in office.

In this sense, the safest bet on the outcome of an experiment in which *N* balls are randomly assigned to *K* urns would be to place money on the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution.

This is the gist of the maximum entropy principle: if one is to infer a probability distribution given certain constraints, out of all distributions $\{ p_{i}\}$ compatible with them, one should pick the distribution $\{ p_{i}^{\star}\}$ having the largest value of [(4)](#fm0040){ref-type=""disp-formula""}.

Tribalism is the state of being organized by, or advocating for, tribes or tribal lifestyles. Human evolution has primarily occurred in small groups, as opposed to mass societies, and humans naturally maintain a social network. In popular culture, tribalism may also refer to a way of thinking or behaving in which people are loyal to their social group above all else, or, derogatorily, a type of discrimination or animosity based upon group differences.

Definition  
The word ""tribe"" can be defined to mean an extended kin group or clan with a common ancestor, or can also be described as a group with shared interests, lifestyles and habits. The proverb ""birds of a feather flock together"" describes homophily, the human tendency to form friendship networks with people of similar occupations, interests, and habits. Some tribes can be located in geographically proximate areas, like villages or bands, though telecommunications enables groups of people to form digital tribes using tools like social networking websites.

In terms of conformity,
tribalism has been defined as a ""subjectivity"" or ""way of being"" social frame in which communities are bound socially beyond immediate birth ties by the dominance of various modalities of face-to-face and object integration. Ontologically, tribalism is oriented around the valences of"

While the materiality of the statements seems clear, it is settled in this circuit that the false statements proscribed by Section 1001 need not be proved to be material.  United States v. Marchisio, 344 F.2d 653, 666 (2d Cir. 1965); United States v. McCue, 301 F.2d 452, 456 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 939, 82 S.Ct. 1586, 8 L.Ed.2d 808 (1962); United States v. Silver, 235 F.2d 375 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 880, 77 S.Ct. 102, 1 L.Ed.2d 80 (1956).

Aadal's knowing participation in the scheme was also shown by the testimony of an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who stated that Aadal had admitted purchasing rags in connection with letters of credit which Aadal knew called for piece goods.  The conclusion of Aadal's guilt is further supported by the fact that Aadal sought rags at the cheapest possible price but shipped them in wooden crates in the way piece goods would be shipped although this was an uneconomical method for shipping rags because ocean freight is calculated on a bulk basis.

Viewed as it must be 'in a light most favorable to the government,' United States v. Robbins, supra, 340 F.2d at 687, the evidence supporting the conviction is, therefore, clearly sufficient.

None of appellant's other claims of error has merit.  He contends that the statements he made to the FBI agent should not have been admitted because they were obtained under circumstances that did not meet constitutional standards expressed in Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  However, the rules established in Miranda are not to be retroactively applied to cases such as this where the trial began before the decision in Miranda was handed down.  Johnson v. State of New Jersey,384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).  Appellant apparently does not claim that his admission was obtained in violation of constitutional standards established before Miranda.  See Escobedo v. State of Illinois,378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964).  In any event, appellant has waived any such claim by not objecting to the introduction into evidence of his statements to the FBI agent.  United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965) (en banc), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966); United States v. Repetti, 364 F.2d 54, 56 (2d Cir. 1966).


12
The other claimed errors, denial of a speedy trial and allegedly prejudicial remarks of the prosecutor in his summation, were similarly waived when timely objections were not interposed.  It is established that 'the right to a speedy trial after arrest or indictment is deemed waived unless promptly asserted.'  United States v. Sanchez, 361 F.2d 824, 825 (1966); United States v. Smalls, 363 F.2d 417, 419 (2d Cir. 1966); United States v. Lustman, 258 F.2d 475, 478 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 880, 79 S.Ct. 118, 3 L.Ed.2d 109 (1958).  Similarly, even if we accept appellant's dubious claim that the prosecutor in his summation misrepresented defense counsel's position, 'it was not, at least absent objection, reversible error.'

KAREN FOSTER

A wise person once said to me as we watched a local organization slowly spiral out of existence: “You know it’s over when they’re counting the pencils in the drawers.”

That stuck with me. So did the next piece of wisdom: That’s why you don’t let accountants run everything. (For the record, this person was an accountant.)

I was reminded of that interaction reading Don Mills’ Feb. 2 To the Point column. He makes a coherent argument, based on a lifetime of research. But this is also an example of what happens when numbers determine the parameters of a vision: on the one hand, it leads to the pursuit of growth or efficiency for growth or efficiency’s sake. On the other, it offers a justification for abandoning projects (and populations) that don’t grow or behave efficiently.

There is no denying that rural communities in Atlantic Canada are losing population. Service delivery is difficult in small places, and work of all kinds — paid, unpaid, seasonal, year-round, formal and informal — is hard to get done when your labour force is shrinking and aging. Many young rural people have trouble seeing a future in their community, and leave if they want to pursue certain kinds of education or careers. Communities that face such challenges are struggling. But they are not in death spirals — not yet.

Indeed, the numbers can tell many different stories, depending on the point you’re trying to make. For example, according to the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities, around half of the province’s GDP is produced outside Halifax, in predominantly rural areas. This year, the NSFM projects that Annapolis County’s economic growth will outpace that of HRM. The productivity per worker is lower outside our major cities, but the idea that rural communities are on life support, producing nothing and draining resources from everywhere else, is far-fetched. Moreover, these numbers suggest, as the OECD’s new rural policy states: rural is not synonymous with decline.

I could spend the rest of this piece using numbers to tell the story I like. Instead, I offer a counter-argument about values, in the spirit of a more ideologically diverse public discussion about the future of Atlantic Canada.

The myth of extraction for enrichment

My argument is that our region needs to set goals other than economic growth and efficiency. No contemporary, forward-looking society can ignore climate change, a phenomenon the esteemed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change attributes largely to economic growth for the sake of growth. The more we extract, produce, export, consume and throw away, the worse our climate prospects get. No urban stadium is going to pull us out of that mess. The “growing resistance to resource development” that puzzles Mills in his column is likely a reflection of citizens' increasing awareness of the ecological limits of economic growth.

That resistance might also reflect the first-hand knowledge of many in our region that the rewards of economic development do not typically go to the people who do the work or live next to the resources. Some kinds of economic growth may provide a “job” for the average Joe, but growth in a labour force, output, exports or corporate profits do not automatically, by market forces alone, contribute to Joe’s well-being, not since productivity and average incomes parted ways in the 1970s.

The myth that a coal mine here or aquaculture facility there will rain jobs and wealth on communities has motivated much regional and rural economic development strategy over the last century, and yet we are here today lamenting that the whole region is in decline.

So what should we aim for"

396,0,29665,"This article contains a somewhat niche collection of information: recovery tactics for six of Melee’s low tier characters. For some, this information may only come in handy when trying to style with these low tiers in friendlies. For others who have subjected themselves to the torture that is maining a low tier, this kind of information may prove crucial in garnering positive results of any kind. If low tiers can find their way back to the stage after getting hit, they take care of at least one of the many ways in which higher tier characters can oppress them. In any case, here are the fundamentals for recovering as the next six characters on Melee’s tier list.





Mario:

Though his recovery is far from the best in the game, Mario has a decent set of tools which he can utilize in order to recover, and he is certainly better off than his medicinally trained counterpart. His Up-B, Super Jump Punch, moves upwards at a diagonal angle, covering a decent amount of vertical and horizontal space, and will commonly be used to reach the stage at the end of a recovery sequence. Of course, Mario has several tools which he can mix into these recovery sequences before having to rely on his Up-B.

If Mario has been launched far above and away from the stage, he can use his Side-B, Cape, to slightly propel himself forward while also stalling his air speed momentarily. By button mashing during his Down-B, Mario Tornado, Mario players will make their character gain a slight vertical boost, granting him a little bit of additional vertical mobility if he has fallen particularly far below the ledge.

True to his own games, Mario can wall jump, naturally buffing his recovery on stages with walls. What’s more, if the Mario player Up-B’s into a wall and flicks the control stick the opposite direction, Mario’s Up-B will be cancelled into a wall jump, thus allowing Mario to Up-B a second time. Thanks to his cornucopia of recovery options, Mario has a decent shot at making it back to the stage whether he is far away from or far below the ledge, although there is a bit of technical difficulty when it comes to completing all portions of his recovery sequence successfully.

Young Link:

Young Link’s Up-B, Spin Attack, is mediocre, often causing him to rely on his other recovery options to at least set up his Up-B to the ledge. Young Link can use his hookshot to perform a wall grapple. Most commonly, Young Link players will recover from offstage by air dodging upwards, using the wall grapple to attach to the side of a stage, and then Up-B’ing after releasing from the side of the stage. That being said, Young Link does have a few other tricks which can be used to improve his recovery even further. Notably, Young Link can perform a bomb recovery offstage if he has an active Bomb while he is"

Nitrogen oxide emissions of Renault's 1.6 dCi Espace were found in tests to be up to 25 times higher than the current Euro-6 limit, German environmental lobby group DUH said, as carmakers come under scrutiny in the wake of a scandal at VW. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe

Berlin (Reuters) - In Abgas-Skandal um VW gerät nun auch Renault in den Fokus.

Die Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) wirft dem französischen Autobauer ebenfalls erhöhte Werte vor. Testergebnisse der Berner Fachhochschule hätten bei einem Espace-Diesel 13 bis 25 Mal höhere Stickoxid-Emissionen ergeben als nach geltendem EU-Standard Euro 6 erlaubt, teilte die DUH am Dienstag mit. Bei Volkswagen weitet sich die Manipulationsaffäre aus. Auch die Töchter Audi und Porsche sind inzwischen betroffen. Damit rückt der Skandal näher an den neuen VW-Chef Matthias Müller heran, der bis vor kurzem noch Porsche lenkte. Zudem ermittelt die Staatsanwaltschaft Braunschweig nun auch wegen Steuerhinterziehung.

Der DUH zufolge waren bei Abgasmessungen des Renault-Espace bei fünf Tests mit warmen Motor deutlich erhöht. Dabei habe sich ein bestimmtes Muster ergeben. “Nur wenn er in einer ganz bestimmten Form auf die am Folgetag stattfindende Prüfung vorbereitet wurde, bestand er diese mit Bravour. Alle Abweichungen in der Vorkonditionierung beziehungsweise Tests mit warmem statt kaltem Motor führten zu Dieselabgaswerten, die wir in dieser Höhe noch nie gemessen haben”, sagte Bundesgeschäftsführer Jürgen Resch.

Die DUH forderte das Bundesverkehrsministerium zu behördlichen Nachprüfungen zu diesen Ergebnissen sowie zu einem bereits vor einem Monat übermittelten Bericht über einen Opel-Zafira-Diesel auf. Zudem gab sie weitere Tests an deutschen und ausländischen Diesel-Pkw in Auftrag. Renault äußerte sich zunächst nicht dazu. Die GM-Tochter Opel hatte im Oktober die DUH-Vorwürfe über gravierende Abweichungen bei Stickoxidwerten zurückgewiesen. Audi räumte am Montagabend ein, dass eine bestimmte Motorensoftware nach US-Recht doch als illegale Abschalttechnik betrachtet werde. Dabei handele es sich um eine Software für die Temperatur-Konditionierung des Abgasreinigungs-Systems. Diese werde in Motoren der US-Modelle A6, A7, A8, Q5 und Q7 verwendet sowie beim VW-Touareg und im Porsche-Cayenne. Volkswagen hatte US-Vorwürfe bislang bestritten und darauf verwiesen, dass die Technik den Katalysator nach dem Start schneller auf Betrieb"
404,19,9049,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot acknowledged Friday she will have no choice but to raise property taxes — which were more than doubled by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel — if her agenda falls flat in the General Assembly’s fall veto session.

Lightfoot’s heavy-lift requests for a graduated real estate transfer tax and a casino gambling fix — either through city-state ownership of a Chicago casino or a revised tax structure — face long odds in Springfield amid a blockbuster corruption scandal that has spread from Chicago and the south suburbs to Springfield.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker was “blindsided” by the mayor’s plan and read about it first in the Chicago Sun-Times.

A legislator who has taken the lead on gambling issues has also argued that re-opening the casino bill for Chicago would “open the floodgates for everybody who has problems with” the legislation causing “unnecessary drama.”

Against that backdrop Lightfoot was asked whether beleaguered Chicago homeowners should brace themselves for yet another property tax increase.

“It’ll be very difficult to avoid a property tax increase if we do not get help from Springfield. … There are limited tools that a mayor can use to generate substantial revenue. Property tax is really chief among them,” the mayor told the Sun-Times.

“It’s certainly my hope to avoid a large property tax increase. I’ve heard that message loud and clear — whether it’s people coming up"
405,14,16154,"Ski travel: DIY versus the tour op package

For some skiers the convenience and security of booking all their holiday components in one place – with a tour operator – is a major draw.

“I could give more than a dozen reasons why it is better to book your ski holiday with a tour operator rather than try to do it yourself,” says Marion Telsnig, spokesperson for Crystal Ski. ""For example, we have experts on hand in-resort if anything goes wrong; we offer financial security - we will always bring you home if there is a disruption; and our customers get a holiday information pack with local info and tips from in-resort reps, downloadable piste and resort maps, snow reports, webcams, and more.""

But the savvy, organised skier can often make big savings on tour operator packages. OnTheSnow has put together some top tips on how to make a DIY ski holiday cost less than the package tour operator equivalent.

The three key parts of your ski holiday typically provided by the tour operator are your flights, transfers and accommodation. Of course tour operators can and do provide much more – insurance, ski rentals, tickets, ski school bookings, bulk buying discounts as well as sometimes a Rep to take care of you – but the flight, transfer and accommodation remain what you are really buying the package for.

Here are some tips to help you create your DIY ski holiday:

DIY Flights

The complex pricing structures from no-frills airlines, which sometimes see skiers facing bills 10 times the initial ‘flight ticket’ price by the time they reach the payment stage, has slowed the growth in independent ski travel. But bargains are still to be had if you’re careful. Most of the traditional airlines like BA and Swiss won’t charge to carry a suitcase (Swiss won’t charge for your skis either) and the ticket price can be little more, sometimes lower, than the no-frills airline cost before all their add ons.

The usual rules of ski travel apply: book as early as you can and travel outside school holiday periods (and preferably when you’ll also avoid the weekend crush in Salzburg or Geneva making travel far more pleasant).

DIY Transfers

The transfer from airport to resort is an often-forgotten element of the package which is a big money-spinner on the ground. It costs several hundred pounds for a transfer from Geneva to many resorts in the French Alps for example – not so bad for a family of four or more where the cost is divided up, but if you’re not careful a small fortune for a sole traveller or a couple. Many resorts do operate their own transfer coach services, sometimes subsidised so the cost is only a few Euros"

Jim: Exactly. It’s totally 100% he’s got to fill the website on those days when there’s not a Rick Olney to go after. He’s got to manufacture controversy, because controversy sells, “if it bleeds, it leads,” let’s start a fight. I totally agree there. I wonder, looking at fan reaction, I haven’t really paid a whole lot of attention to the fan reaction, the comments, I didn’t read the comments section, because that way lies madness.

Tony: That’s probably a good way to go. Every time I read the comments sections, I always end up regretting it.

Jim: I think it breaks down to the two polarized sides, “those damn greedy creators are trying to take away my comic books because they want money” or conversely, “the evil corporation is screwing the creators again,” and no middle ground, and no understanding of what the contracts are or what they entail or how this number was arrived at. I’m wondering if some of the perception plays off of the fact, well, this is me as a fan saying “I’m still pissed that 30 years ago DC screwed you on Black Vulcan.”

Tony: I have a theory on, I have a philosophy on some of this stuff… and it’s basically that there’s only so much hate I’m capable of processing at any given time. And right now my quota of hate is pretty much taken up by the Trump administration.

Jim: Lot of that going around.

Tony: So I really don’t have time to be upset about Black Vulcan anymore. I do still manage to be a little bit upset about Jim Shooter screwing over my Ghost Rider ending; I’ll never be thrilled with the way I got dumped off the second Black Lightning series; but y’know, I can only spend so much of my time hating anything. And as I said, Trump and his people more than take up that percentage of my time that I have to waste on this sort of stuff, so I’m over the Black Vulcan thing. I still think that every time Black Vulcan is used anywhere that I should get paid, but it’s not going to be a big issue for me.

These past few years, I’ve been treated with great respect by both DC and Marvel, I may not get everything I want, but I will say that when I was doing the Black Lightning: Cold Dead Hands miniseries, which I think is the finest work I’ve done in comics, it was a gutsy, up-to-the-moment series, and nobody at DC flinched. And that was despite the fact that the usual alt-right Nazi idiots were attacking it, and that’s just going to happen, it’s a polarized country, but DC didn’t flinch. I got to tell the story I wanted to tell; it’s my story, my editors, Jim Chadwick and Harvey Richards, never tried to make it their story. Their work was always to help me tell my story better. And they did. They gave me probably the best notes I’ve ever received in comics, they were never carved in stone. Sometimes I made changes based on their notes; sometimes I explained to them why I wasn’t going to make the changes. But nothing that was changed in Black Lightning, other than in the second issue, for some reason, Standards & Practices wouldn’t let me use the word “ass.” Despite the fact that it had been used in the previous issue; I didn’t get any “black ass,” I didn’t get any “lame ass,” didn’t get any “punk ass,” and when I started sending notes to Standards & Practices basically with headlines like “Tony Wants Ass,” they started to realize that I would embarrass the shit out of them if they pulled that on me again.

The nature of the orthopaedic surgeon's practice places him or her at a unique balance point of necessary versus unnecessary radiation exposure. Although hospital policies place guidelines for acceptable occupational radiation exposure, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends a maximum of 20 mGy/y of occupational exposure.^[@bibr10-2325967118801275]^ The ICRP cautions that radiation exposure past the recommended limitations may cause local skin damage and systemic absorption, leading to DNA changes, with the risk of developing a possible malignancy.^[@bibr25-2325967118801275]^ Even more important is the orthopaedic surgeon's role in managing patient radiation exposure, especially during fluoroscopically guided procedures in which patient exposure can average as high as 40 mGy/min compared with 0.2 mGy/min for the surgeon.^[@bibr19-2325967118801275]^

Radiation exposure poses a 2-tiered effect on the human body. In the acute setting, it can cause damage to skin and hair (a deterministic effect, measured in Gy), and with chronic use, it can cause carcinogenesis (a stochastic effect, measured in rem). High doses of radiation (2 Gy) are required to produce skin burns and hair loss, which are levels much higher than what is seen for orthopaedic patients or surgeons. However, a lifetime exposure of 100 rem can increase the risk of death from cancer by 5%.^[@bibr3-2325967118801275],[@bibr7-2325967118801275]^ On average, a person will be exposed to approximately 300 mrem as part of natural background radiation.^[@bibr22-2325967118801275]^ The use of personal radiation protective equipment, such as lead aprons and thyroid shields, with a thickness of 0.25 to 0.5 mm, can prevent the majority of radiation transmission to protected areas during procedures; however, it should be noted that the arms, hands, and other unprotected areas are still exposed. Although a useful method of preventing deterministic and stochastic effects, the patient's positioning and operative site can preclude the ability of providing appropriate protection.^[@bibr1-2325967118801275],[@bibr8-2325967118801275]^

The reported data are consistent with findings in the previous literature of a significantly higher radiation exposure to patients compared with surgeons. This is of particular concern given the close proximity of the patient's gonads, one of the more radiation-sensitive organs in the body, to the surgical field and the inability to appropriately shield these organs. Canham et al^[@bibr7-2325967118801275]^ investigated the link between radiation exposure and increased cancer risk in patients undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery, finding an average of 4.9 mGy of radiation exposure with a lifetime increased risk of cancer of 0.025%. In contrast, the surgical staff had increased radiation exposure from 7 to 9 mrem and an increased lifetime risk of death from cancer by 0.0005%.^[@bibr7-2325967118801275]^

Budd et al^[@bibr5-2325967118801275]^ examined the patient's effective radiation dose and the carcinogenic potential during hip arthroscopic surgery performed in the lateral position. Using an excess mortality coefficient of 5.5 × 10^--5^ mGy^−1^ applied to the patient's effective"

Implications Of The U.S. Withdrawal From The TPP

Nov 25, 2017

President-Elect Trump's threat to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) should be taken seriously, despite how mercurial he has already proven to be in failing to follow through on a variety of other campaign promises. Withdrawal from the trade pact is a critical part of the core commitments Trump made to his constituency. Given that he has the Congress in his pocket for the next two years (at least), and that they will be similarly anxious to be seen as delivering on that particular promise, it should be expected that the U.S. will indeed be withdrawn from the pact.

If the pact had not been negotiated in such secrecy, and if the perception on the U.S. street was not that it benefitted big business at the expense of the average working person, perhaps momentum would not be on Trump's and the Republicans' side. But the truth is that the way the pact was negotiated and kept in total secrecy left a rightfully sour taste in many peoples' mouths. That has only exacerbated the economic nationalism, isolationist tendencies, and rise of the right that were already well underway in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world prior to Trump's rise to power.

Assuming that the U.S. withdrawal occurs in the early part of 2017, what are some of the political and economic implications that may be expected? First and foremost, the U.S. will succeed in shooting itself in the foot by making it more difficult and costly to export its goods to the rest of the world, but also by ceding the ability to have a primary role in shaping the coming 21st century global trade architecture. The knee-jerk reaction Trump is succumbing to and promoting is simply self-defeating in the long term.

Second, while economic nationalism and isolationism ultimately end up hurting the nations that embrace them, it just so happens that what the U.S. does (or doesn't do) still matters to the rest of the world, so we should expect that if TPP were to die as a result of Trump and the U.S. Congress' actions, scores of other nations will seek bilateral alternatives or other multilateral alternatives. The world is already far too reliant on bilateral trade agreements and although agreeing on an alternative multilateral structure will surely prove difficult (as all others have), that will presumably not stop other nations from seeking to do so -- with or without the U.S.

Third, China stands to gain -- a lot -- in the process. Just as Beijing was able to portray itself as a bastion of fiscal conservatism during the Great Recession, it is already in the process of portraying itself as the guardian of trade multilateralism and transparency by pushing its existing alternative to the TPP - the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Along with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (China's creation) and the BRICS Bank (both headquartered in China), Beijing is already well along the way to creating its own 'alternative' trade and investment reality. While the U.S. is busy tying itself up into knots on the global stage politically and economically, China is eating its lunch, and many nations in Asia and around the world are happily drinking the Chinese kool-aid. The U.S. withdrawal from the TPP should work out about as well for the U.S. as the Asia Pivot has, with China likely to reap the rewards for having been prepared and foresightful enough to present alternatives to Asia and the rest of the world -- even though it naturally benefits in the process.

Perhaps in response to those who are already warning him of some of the consequences of withdrawing from the TPP, Trump will develop an ambition to create another alternative to the TPP -- but in his name and selling it so that the American worker will be ""sold"" as a primary beneficiary. Even nationalistic American workers presumably wouldn't oppose a new trade pact negotiated in broad"

McKesson, a leading healthcare company for wholesale medical supplies and equipment, pharmaceutical distribution, and healthcare technology, delivers one-third of prescription medicine in North America, supports 15,000 pharmacies and more than 9,000 oncologists and other medical specialists, and offers more than 250,000 SKUs of brand and private label medical-surgical supplies.

Striving – and achieving – supply chain excellence is a top priority for the company, which takes a global approach to procuring and sourcing its products, and reports 99.98 percent order accuracy in North America.

DATAVERSITY® had an opportunity to learn from Scott Mooney, Vice President, Distribution Operations for McKesson Pharmaceuticals, about the company’s Data Management for the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), which outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. Mooney discussed how McKesson is leveraging GS1 Standards for Data Management in support of DSCSA and supply chain optimization and how it is experimenting with Blockchain for DSCSA.

DATAVERSITY (DV): How does the use of GS1 supply chain standards impact McKesson?

Mooney: We have found that GS1 standards are best suited for product marking/identification and to exchange DSCSA data, regardless of data structure such as Blockchain. We implement standards for full supply chain visibility, which includes globally identifying products and locations (including partner locations), capturing data associated with them in the supply chain.

GS1 Standards are tremendously valuable to our operations because they make our systems truly interoperable with that of our trading partners. They make our business processes more efficient to be able to meet the requirements set forth in DSCSA. Not only are we confident in our ability to meet or exceed DSCSA deadlines, but we can also leverage standards beyond just compliance to be a proactive and communicative supply chain partner.

At least 648 coho this winter made their way against the current up meandering, forested Lagunitas Creek and its many tributaries on the northwestern side of Mount Tamalpais, according to a new census by biologists.

The coho run is the largest in the North Bay since the winter of 2006-07 and well above the long-term average of about 500 fish. It’s the sixth-largest run since systematic surveys began in 1996.

The surge of salmon is being credited to habitat restoration efforts for the endangered fish.

“Many organizations and individuals have worked tirelessly for years to improve fish habitat in the creeks of Marin County, and it’s gratifying to see so many salmon returning to those creeks,” said Eric Ettlinger, an aquatic ecologist for the Marin Municipal Water District, which conducted the count with Watershed Stewards Program, National Park Service and the Salmon Protection and Watershed Network.

O empresário Eike Batista tornou-se réu na Justiça Federal do Rio sob a acusação de ter cometido crimes contra o mercado de capitais na venda de ações da ex-OGX, em dois períodos durante o ano de 2013.

Esta é a primeira de três denúncias apresentados por procuradores da República, no Rio e em São Paulo, que se tornou processo criminal, levando o empresário à condição de réu, o que deverá culminar em julgamento.

A denúncia havia sido apresentada pelo Ministério Público Federal fluminense à Justiça no dia 11 de setembro. Responsáveis pela denúncia, os procuradores Rodrigo Poerson e Orlando Cunha encontraram indícios de crimes de ""insider trading"" (negociação de ações com base em informação privilegiada, não conhecida pelo público) e manipulação de mercado.

De acordo com a decisão do juiz Flávio Roberto de Souza, da 3ª Vara Criminal, ""os fatos narrados se amoldam, ao menos abstratamente, aos tipos penais imputados aos réus"".

A suposta prática dos crimes teriam ocorrido em dois períodos em que o empresário negociou ações. Uma delas entre maio e junho de 2013, com volume negociado de R$ 197,2 milhões, com lucro estimado entre R$ 123,8 milhões e R$ 126,3 milhões.

Dias depois, a OGX veio ao mercado reconhecer que as três principais áreas de exploração de petróleo não tinham a produção viável comercialmente, embora a empresa houvesse declarado essa viabilidade quatro meses antes.

The board held that while the earlier Weiss patent mentioned ""a rather moist condition"" of the pulp so that the fibers are readily separable, nothing appeared there to show such a degree of moisture as would prevent adhesion of the bonding material during its fusion. It stated that no suggestion is to be found in the later Weiss patent that the fibers are maintained in moist condition until the bonding material is placed upon them and that the patent is devoid of any teaching as to the amount of moisture the fibers must contain, and therefore the effect desired by appellant could not be produced. The board also found that the spraying of an adhesive solution after shredding in the method of the patent does not correspond to the disclosure of applying the bonding material to the moist fibers by appellant. With respect to the later of the Weiss patents, the board reached the same conclusion, whether that patent be considered alone or combined with the earlier Weiss patent. It pointed out that in the application of appellant there must be a moisture content in excess of the 10% mentioned in the later Weiss patent and that appellant, in his application, discusses the terms ""moist"" and ""air dry"" so as to exclude the reference showings. The board further observed that in the involved application the critical point of moisture is ""well above 10%,"" and that the specific examples disclosed moisture content ranging from 100% to 300%. Therefore, the board could not support the reasoning of the examiner in his rejection of the involved method claims. It then stated that with respect to the involved article claims similar reasons were applicable. It held that a process had been disclosed and claimed by appellant differing substantially from the prior art relied on by the examiner and if weight be given to the disclosure of appellant then his process must produce a different product.


18
In the second decision of the board it was stated that the principle issue between the appellant and the examiner appeared to be in what constituted a ""moist"" mixture of fibers. It noted that in the disclosure of the Asplund patent a mixture is said to produce ""a suitable degree of dryness"" when the moisture content of the mixture is in a range which embraces that of appellant's disclosure.


19
Upon appellant's second request for reconsideration, the board in its decision referred to its rejection of the involved claims as it appeared in its original decision and stated that ""It is the amount of water, not the particular technical term for the condition of the mixture, that is important herein."" (Italics quoted.)


20
Counsel for appellant in his brief seeks to avoid the disclosure of the prior art by arguing that in appellant's process there is a drying step added to the process of the patentee Weiss. We find in the Weiss patent, No. 1,336,402, that ""The mass of fibers is next dried and may thereafter be gently beaten to remove the uncemented fibers and produce a less `dusty' mat and finally smoothed out, the last two steps being omitted when desired."" (Italics ours.) It also appears in the Asplund patent that after a sheet has been formed, it is dried under a moderate pressure. Consequently, it is clear that patentability of the involved claims may not be predicated on the final step of drying.


21
A decision as to whether or not the moisture content disclosed in the Asplund patent is sufficient to warrant the rejection of the appealed claims in connection with the Weiss patents, is decisive of the issue here.


22
It is stated in the Asplund patent that the material used therein may be considered to be in a dry state when quantities of water vary between 1 and 3 kgs. for each kg. of material. It is further stated that moisture quantities above 7 kg. for each kg. of dry material ought not to be utilized. It seems to us that the latter ratio of moisture to dry material would result in a very wet mixture, as contended by counsel for appellant. Even so, the rejection by the board was not based on the statement that the material ""may be considered"

David Allen ""Dave"" Clarke (October 13, 1943 – March 27, 1997) was a civil-rights worker, attorney, and Democratic politician in Washington, D.C. Elected as one of the original members of the Council of the District of Columbia when D.C. gained home rule in 1974, Clarke served as its chair from 1983 to 1991, and again from the death of John A. Wilson in 1993 until his own death in 1997.

The District of Columbia School of Law was renamed the David A. Clarke School of Law for Clarke in 1998.

Early life and education
David Allen Clarke was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on October 13, 1943, to Allen Joseph Clarke and Ophia Carroll Clarke. After his father died while he was an infant, his mother and he moved to Southwest, Washington, D.C.  

Clarke's mother worked as a clerk at the United States Department of Agriculture. They later moved to the neighborhood of Shaw. Clarke attended public schools, namely Thompson Elementary School, Jefferson Junior High, and Western High School. Clarke's mother died of tuberculosis when Clarke was 16 years old, and he moved in with his aunt, who was also living in Shaw. 

Clarke earned a Bachelor of Arts in religion from George Washington University in 1965. He then enrolled at Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, but he longed to take a more direct role in the Civil Rights Movement. Two weeks later, Clarke transferred to the nearby Upland Institute for Social Change and Conflict Management. At Clarke's instance, Upland Institute sent him to work for Walter E. Fauntroy at the recently formed D.C. Coalition for Conscience.

When Greater Washington Board of Trade opposed home rule for the District, Clarke protested next to the Washington Monument on July 4, 1966. When Clarke began reading the United States Declaration of Independence, he was arrested.

Clarke decided to pursue a Juris Doctor from Howard University School of Law. Clarke arranged for legal assistance for protesters who participated in the Poor People's Campaign, a protest encampment on the Mall that lasted for five rainy weeks in the spring of 1968. Clarke also ran the Washington office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which was founded by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Clarke graduated from Howard University School of Law in 1969, and he opened a private practice the following year.

Career
Before his service on Council of the District of Columbia, he was counsel and Director of the Washington Bureau of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was legal assistant to the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund. He also served as a program evaluator for the U.S. Senate Committee on Nutrition. In 1974, David Clarke was elected as the Ward One Representative on the Council of the District of Columbia- first Council elected by District of Columbia voters. During his eight years as the representative of Ward One, he was chairperson of the Judiciary Committee, a member of the Council's Housing and Finance committee, and chairperson of the Public Safety Committee of the Metropolitan Council of Governments, where he was a proponent of gun control. He and his wife, a city schoolteacher, had one son.

While on the Council, he was known for an ability to transcend race, a legacy from his experience as an activist and important in a racially divided district. His aggressive style at times made consensus-building difficult.

Clarke died of a central nervous system lymphoma, a form of brain cancer."

No-slip boundary conditions ($\Gamma_{wall}$), i.e., the velocity of fluid is zero, are applied on the top and bottom walls and on the solid walls of the cylinder. The boundary condition corresponding to an out-flow boundary ($\Gamma_{out}$) is imposed based on the assumption that the derivative of the velocity along the $X$-axis is zero at the outlet, which implies that the flow is fully-developed or does not change significantly. More strictly, it is set as:

$$-p\bm n+\frac{1}{Re}(\nabla\bm u\cdot\bm n)=0,$$

where $\bm n$ is the unit vector normal to the outlet.

To avoid velocity discontinuity between the boundary of the jets and the no-slip surfaces of the cylinder, the radial velocity profiles ($\Gamma_j$) of the four synthetic jets are prescribed as:

$$u_{jet}(\theta, Q_i)=\frac{\pi}{\omega D}Q_i\cos(\frac{\pi}{\omega}(\theta-\theta_0)),$$

where $Q_i(i=1, 2, 3, 4)$ is the mass flow rate of the four jets centered at $\theta_0=75^\circ$, $105^\circ$, $255^\circ$ and $285^\circ$, respectively. $\omega=10^\circ$ is the width of each jet.

Tivemos uma aceleração expansiva nos anos sessenta e setenta.
Você pode ter pensado, como eu pensava na época, 
que nossa espécie já estaria em Marte antes do século acabar.
Mas, ao invés, retrocedemos.
Sem contar robôs, afastamo-nos dos planetas e das estrelas.
Continuo me perguntando: seria um fracasso da coragem ou um sinal de maturidade?
Talvez tenha sido o máximo que poderíamos razoavelmente esperar.
De certa forma, é incrível até mesmo que tenha sido possível.
Mandamos uma dúzia de seres humanos em excursões de uma semana à lua.
Missões que devolveram uma riqueza de dados,
mas nada com valor prático diário, arroz-com-feijão, de curto prazo.
Pelo menos não muito.
Mas ergueram o espírito humano.
Iluminaram-nos em relação ao nosso lugar no Universo.
Um programa de alta visibilidade afetando a forma como vemos a nós mesmos
poderia clarificar a fragilidade de nosso ambiente planetário e dos perigos e responsabilidades em comum
entre todos os povos e nações da Terra.
Há algo mais.
Voo espacial se comunica com algo profundo dentro de nós.
De muitos de nós, se não todos.
Uma colega cientista me contou sobre uma viagem recente aos planaltos de Nova Guiné,
onde ela visitou uma cultura da idade da pedra

Eles ignoravam relógios de pulso, refrigerantes, comida congelada...
Mas sabiam da Apollo 11.
Sabiam que humanos haviam andado na Lua.
Sabiam os nomes de Armstrong e Aldrin e Collins.
Eles queriam saber quem estava visitando a Lua atualmente.
Projetos orientados para o futuro, que, apesar de dificuldades políticas,
podem apenas ser completados em uma década distante,

Colocar os pés em outros mundos é algo que sussurra em nossos ouvidos

434,13,2397,"At The Nationals: Diary of a Sonoma ice skater

Posted on June 8, 2015 by Sonoma Valley Sun

Sonoma veternarian Vallard Forsythe shares the experience of competing in last month’s U.S. Figure Skating Adult Championships.

I was really nervous this year when I took the ice for my free skating program at US Adult Nationals in Salt Lake City in April. After all, a few short weeks earlier in Las Vegas, I had skated dismally at the qualifying sectional competition. I had been very sick with Mycoplasma pneumonia and spent the week following the competition in the hospital recovering. Although I was in much better shape in Salt Lake City, the memory of my poor finish in Las Vegas and the terrible score I got there still haunted me like the feeling you have when you lock yourself out of your car on a hot day and your dog is inside looking at you.

The division I compete in is called Gold Men. It includes the best male skaters from around the country from ages 21 to 60. The talent and ability of these 13 men who made it into the competition is pretty formidable: these guys can jump, spin and move around the ice in a pretty impressive way. Not only that, but some of them take it pretty seriously too, despite the fact that it is Adult competition, not Olympic eligible competition. It is supposed to be fun, and it is, it truly is.

But I guess I’ve been in a bit of a slump lately, with my confidence plummeting in the past few months. Erratic training and a so-so performance can erode the confidence of almost any skater, and I was really trying to rally back emotionally as I waited for my turn to go out and skate.

About three minutes before I was to take the ice, I quietly asked my coach “Choaleen, what does it take for me to simply nail the jump, to go up for the axel and turn around twice and have a nice, soft one foot landing. To just complete the jump without fear or hesitation”. I had done this jump in my younger days. I can do this jump from muscle memory. It is a treacherous maneuver, with a quick forward takeoff and turns in the air and a backwards landing on one foot. And most frustratingly, I had never landed one cleanly and perfectly in competition as an Adult. All my other jumps, just not that difficult one.

“Well, Vallard”, she said, very calmly, “you just know you have this one opportunity, and when its gone, you can’t get it back. You are out there for 3 minutes, you know its the second element in your program, after the camel spin. As you skate into it, you prepare for the jump, and simply go for it, knowing you have nothing to lose, its fun, and you can’t get it back if you don’t do it.”

I just looked at her. She was right. Silently, something clicked in me, and I had a feeling, a gut feeling, that my program would be more exciting and spontaneous for me that day than normal.

Taking the ice in my blue cat-suit, the strains of East of Eden began lilting through the arena. I could feel every strand of the music, and I smiled. The camel spin felt nice, and flowing, and I took my time coming out of it. I was in a state of suspended animation as I prepped for the next jump, named after Axel Paulsen, the famous Norwegian who invented it. He invented the jump 150 years ago, and it is every figure skaters nemesis. As I leaned back on a deeply bent knee and pressed forward into the jump, I felt weightless and spun up. Instantly, the jump was over, the spin in the air and a light sweet tap backwards on the sweet toe-pick spot of my blade. There was a roar from the audience, and a smile on my face as I realized I had landed the jump perfectly. In fact, nobody was prepared for me to even attempt the jump because I hadn’t bothered to try one during the 6 minute warm up.

After that jump, the rest of my program is a blur. My coach says the other jumps and spins were nice, I skated to every strain of the"
435,19,5999,"IAAF Grand Prix

The IAAF Grand Prix was an annual, global circuit of one-day outdoor track and field competitions organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It was created in 1985 as the IAAF's first seasonal track and field circuit and lasted until 2009. Athletes scored points based on their performances on the circuit and the top athletes were invited to the annual IAAF Grand Prix Final. 

The IAAF Grand Prix expanded over its lifetime to incorporate the IAAF Golden League, the IAAF Super Grand Prix, IAAF Grand Prix and IAAF Grand Prix II. IAAF/Area Permit Meetings were also attached to the series, allowing athletes to score additional points in certain events at lower level meetings. In 2003 the series concept was renamed at the IAAF World Outdoor Meetings and the Grand Prix was reduced to a single tier of competitions within that tour. The series was again folded into the IAAF World Athletics Tour upon its creation in 2006, before being rendered defunct by the introduction of the IAAF Diamond League and IAAF World Challenge in 2010.

History
Created in 1985, the IAAF Grand Prix was the first global series of outdoor invitational track and field meetings organised by the IAAF. It followed on from the IAAF Golden Events (1978–82), where the IAAF helped finance meetings between the world's top athletes to encourage seasonal engagement with the sport outside of the Olympic cycle. The creation of the IAAF Grand Prix circuit came two years after the first World Championships in Athletics in 1983, highlighting the sports governing body's pivot to a more direct role in organising athletics competitions.

From 1985 to 1992 the series featured Grand Prix Meetings and IAAF Permit Meetings. The series culminated in the IAAF Grand Prix Final, which athletes gained qualification to based on their performances at the series' meetings. The competing athletes at the final earned additional points for their performances there, and the series winner of each event was the athlete with the highest score (as opposed to the Grand Prix Final event winner). In 1993 the Grand Prix format was amended so that the event winner was the first place athlete at the Final competitions, rather than the seasonal points leader, and this format continued until the last Grand Prix Final in 2002. 

In 1993 the IAAF Council approved a new tier of IAAF Grand Prix II meetings, which Permit-level meetings could apply for after two years. That same year four of the Grand Prix meetings (Oslo, Zurich, Brussels and Berlin) organised a Golden Four group of top-level European meetings within the series. In response, the IAAF Grand Prix series was again expanded with the foundation of the IAAF Golden League in 1998, which split out the Golden Four meetings (plus the Herculis and Golden Gala meets) as a new top tier within the IAAF Grand Prix circuit. After this point, the IAAF Grand Prix referred to multiple concepts in that it was both an annual series of track and field meetings incorporating four tiers (the IAAF Golden League, IAAF Grand Prix, IAAF Grand Prix II and Area Permit Meetings) as well as a term to refer to the second and third tiers of that series. In 2003, an IAAF Super Grand Prix level was added to the circuit, the IAAF Permit Meeting tier was dropped, and the Grand Prix Final was replaced with the IAAF World Athletics Final.

In 2003 the IAAF World Outdoor Meetings brand superseded the IAAF Grand Prix to the umbrella series concept and Grand Prix levels I and II continued within that series. In 2006, the IAAF World Athletics Tour was formed to replace the World Outdoor Meetings and at this time the IAAF Grand Prix II tier was dropped"

GRIFFIN B. BELL, Circuit Judge:


1
This appeal presents the issue whether membership in a class action brought under § 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(e), is restricted to individuals who have filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The District Court answered in the affirmative. Mondy v. Crown Zellerbach Corporation, E.D.La., 1967, 271 F.Supp. 258, 264-266. Being of the view that the class was unduly restricted, we reverse.


2
The suit giving rise to this issue was instituted on March 1, 1967 by four Negro employees (Hill, Oatis, Johnson and Young) of Crown Zellerbach Corporation. The suit was filed against the company and the two local unions representing employees at the Bogalusa, Louisiana plant of the company. Each plaintiff sued on behalf of himself and all present and prospective Negro employees of the plant, as a class, seeking injunctive relief against unfair employment practices as defined by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 2000e-2 and 3.

444,23,22374,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug

The first “Hobbit” film was needlessly long, padded with backstory, cameos and Easter eggs into a cartoony, rehashed bore. Peter Jackson’s devotion to his source material just seemed like indulgence the first time around. With “The Desolation of Smaug” however, Jackson has turned that obsession into a Wikipedia entry.

This second “Hobbit” film is so devoid of actual ideas or substance that it is not merely a meandering middle film without a proper beginning or ending, but it stands to be about nothing at all. It is so obsessed with its own plot details that “The Desolation of Smaug” becomes a litany of portentous prophecies, stern warnings and untrusting conversations between various species and creeds.

The film doesn’t so much pick up where the last one left off but drops us in a new CGI playground. First they outrun the orcs still chasing them, then they escape the spiders in a mystical forest, then they escape the elves holding them captive, and finally they evade the humans somehow bent on arresting them. Eventually they will reach the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) that was merely hyped in the first film, only setting up what is now prepared to be a three hour long battle sequence in “The Hobbit: There and Back Again.”

Missing from all of this is a sense of purpose and a set of values. Gone are the words of wisdom from Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who sidelines himself for much of the movie, or even the cheeky riddles and split personalities from everyone’s favorite Gollum, here replaced by Smaug to only recite more threats about how the dwarves will never reclaim their home.

What he has added (because even Jackson is not averse to fan fiction) is mightily slim. Legolas (Orlando Bloom) returns mostly for stylish, Elvish beheadings of orcs, but he’s also caught in a love triangle between the new elf maiden Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the dwarf Kili (Aiden Turner). This drama is as manufactured and stiff as the elves. It introduces a woman and an extra archer into the mayhem and little else.

It feels remarkably overplotted in its details and somehow underplotted in how slight of consequence they are. We’ve gotten to the point where the characters are admiring the stone walls of the halls of Erebor. Jackson is constantly whip panning around the CGI vistas and playing with objects and characters in the 3-D foreground, still tinkering with the 48 frames per second that can be as plastic-y as it looked before.

It’s frustratingly pretty in a franchise that used to be grittily realistic. For"

With these constraints in mind, a boost in demand through higher government expenditures would be a mistake. The target is to reduce these constraints through incentives on investment (through public investment) and education. That will be the main government task in 2018.

The graph below shows that the current growth trend is slightly lower than before the 2008 crisis. It means that there will be no catching up and that the cost of the crisis is permanent. The gap between the current GDP level and the trend from 2000 to 2008 is -8%. The GDP level would have been 8% higher without the crisis. This is quite big and this gap will widen in coming years as I do not expect a catchup of growth.

The Euro Area (EA) economy is now following a robust growth trend. It has started in 2013 and in 2016 and 2017 the EA GDP growth will be higher than in the US. On the graph, on the right it can be seen that there are little fluctuations in the current growth trajectory.
This reflects a less restrictive fiscal policy at the EA level in reversal to what was seen at the beginning of the decade. Fiscal policy was too tight in 2011 to 2013 and pushed the economy into a deep and prolonged recession from mid-2011 to the end of 2012. A more neutral fiscal policy helps to improve its predictability and to reduce uncertainty for the private sector.
After summer 2012 the ECB has adopted a very accommodative monetary regime. Interest rate converged to 0% for the refi rate and after 2014 there were two operations bringing liquidity to the financial and banking sector and to financial markets. On one side there was a temporary exchange of assets (4 year period) which targeted the banking sector (LTRO). The recovery was possible only with a strong and robust banking sector. In the fall of 2017 the banking sector is stronger even in Italy where we were all worried. And there was an asset purchases operation in order to push down interest rates. The QE operation is the purchase of a large amount of sovereign debt (EUR 60bn per month since April 2017) and of corporate debt.

Ancient Pathways

Divine Spirit told me, ""Follow the paths of the Ancients"" over 13 years ago...I still do not know exactly what that means, however, I can say that I am on my way and loving it! Their Rod and Staff comforts me!

Why is it that we sometimes feel that we must hold back on certain phrases, words and revelations because of what someone who does not understand the Process of Redemption may think? We sometimes think that we must explain or attempt to explain what the Divine Creator is doing in our life as we make the transition into another spiritual realm that we do not fully understand let alone can explain.

Why can't we or should we not explain? First of all Spiritual things are spiritually discerned! Secondly, because we have not experienced 'it' on that level yet! I will continue to reiterate; one cannot tell something they do not know; give something they do not have; or teach/share what they have not experienced!

I will never forget when I was guided into the Apostleship, my dear sister of whom was drawn to me to learn Truth, once I told her that my title was no longer Prophet but Apostle. Her reply was, “You don’t know what you want to be”!

However, to the contrary, I did and do know! I know who I AM! I know who I was created and predestined to be and I walk daily with that one goal in mind--Restoration and"

A 97-Year-Old Mystery

It had all the makings of a made for TV movie. On a stormy October night in 1920, Francis Korous, a 40-year old nurse from Salt Lake City boarded a streetcar for home and was never seen alive again. Numerous rumors floated around regarding her disappearance. A massive search effort took place and for almost three weeks no trace of her was found.

When her body was eventually found, instead of providing answers it only created more questions. This is the story of the disappearance of Francis Korous.

Who Was Francis Korous?

Francis Korous was born on November 10th, 1879 in Iowa. Her parents were from Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic) and had immigrated to the United States shortly before her birth. She moved with her family to Salt Lake City in 1903, and in 1906 she graduated along with her sister Rose, from the nursing program at St. Mark’s Hospital.

She continued working at St. Mark’s Hospital until she enlisted in the Navy (along with her sister) on November 7th, 1917. She served as a Nurse in the Naval Hospital in Newport, Rhode Island until she was discharged on February 19th, 1920. Francis and her sister Rose returned to Salt Lake City to be near family, and Francis moved into the Y.W.C.A. in downtown Salt Lake City.

Last Seen Alive

On Sunday, October 17th, 1920 Francis spent the evening visiting her brother Yarrow and his family. She brought bags of candy for her nieces and nephews, and according to her brother and sister-in-law, they had a pleasant and uneventful visit.

Just before 9 pm, Yarrow walked Francis to the corner of Fourth North and Ninth West and watched her board the Ninth East street car. Francis’ trip would take her through downtown Salt Lake City and drop her off just across the street from the Y.W.C.A. on 3rd East and 3rd South. The map below shows the various streetcar routes in the 1920’s. The green dot represents where Francis boarded the streetcar, and the red dot was where she should have disembarked.

The following day when Francis failed to show up for work at St. Mark’s Hospital her family and friends became concerned that something was wrong. When they learned she never arrived at the Y.W.C.A. they feared that maybe she had been in an accident and was at a local hospital.

By October 20th, 1920 her disappearance made the front page of the local newspaper with police asking anyone with information to come forward. In the following days, numerous rumors would begin to swirl, with yet no sight of Francis Korous anywhere.

The Search For Francis

The police began operating under the assumption that Francis had been hit by a car and carried off. In the first few days, they believed she must be unconscious in a hospital somewhere. On the 24th a woman named Mrs. Mercedes LaBonde came forward and told police that on the night of Francis’ disappearance she heard “groans and gasps” of a woman at 9:39 pm. Mrs. LaBonde lived on the corner of"

453,5,23590,"Introduction
============

Between 1970 and 2008, the incidence of bladder cancer (BC) in males and females residing in New South Wales (NSW) Australia has decreased primarily due to decreased smoking, although this trend may be partially artifactual due to coding practice changes [@b1]. Over this time, male BC mortality rates have also decreased, however female mortality rates have not [@b1]--[@b3]. The reason for such discrepancy between genders is not understood.

Demographic heterogeneity is well recognized in patients with BC, however the effect of gender on BC incidence, stage at presentation, mortality, and survival time has not been well described. Survival from BC has been reported to be worse for females compared to males [@b4]--[@b10], despite the fact that BC is 3--4 times more common in males than females. However, this finding is controversial. Some reports have shown no difference in survival between genders following radical cystectomy [@b11], while other reports indicate that females lose substantially more years of life from BC mortality compared to men [@b12].

Suggested reasons for worse survival include late presentation [@b6], disparities in treatment [@b13] or intrinsic biological differences [@b14]. The aim of this study was to investigate the discrepancy in survival from BC by gender and explore potential explanations for the difference using a population-wide linkage study.

Methods
=======

Data for NSW residents with a diagnosis of BC were obtained from the NSW Central Cancer Registry (CCR). Operational details of the Registry have been described previously [@b3]. In brief, notifications to the CCR of invasive BC (ICD-10 code: C67) diagnosed in NSW are mandated from pathology laboratories, hospitals and other treatment centers under the NSW Public Health Act 1991 [@b3]. Noninvasive and in situ BCs are not registered and not included in this study. For this study, all registered cases diagnosed between January 2001 and December 2009 were included. Death information was obtained by electronic linkage of the records from the CCR with NSW death records from the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages to ascertain vital status (January 2001--December 2009) and Australia Bureau of Statistics to ascertain cause of death (January 2001--December 2007). All (100%) of the patients were able to be linked. Hospital admission and treatment details were retrieved by linkage to the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) for all hospital separations in NSW in the period January 2000--June 2009. Linkage was successful in 98% of cases. Hospital medical coders abstract individual patient information from medical records following the patient's discharge from the hospital. This includes dates of admission and separation, procedures carried out and diagnoses relating to the hospital episode. Linkage of records in these data sets was carried out by the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL), using probabilistic matching carried out with ChoiceMaker software (ChoiceMaker Technologies Inc., New York, NY). This linkage was performed using name, address, date of birth, date of diagnosis, and hospital-recorded clinical information that identified cases common to all data sets. Clerical reviews for questionable matches were undertaken by trained staff within the CHeReL.

For the 74% of BC cases where data on degree of spread at diagnosis was available, cancers were categorized as localized, regional or distant. BC notified to the CCR with a 2001--2009 diagnosis and a recorded degree of spread was investigated in the present study. Eighty six (\<2%) cases identified from autopsy or death records (""death certificate only"") were excluded because it was not possible to ensure that the date of diagnosis, recorded by the CCR as month and year of diagnosis, did not precede the date of death. All cases were classified by: (1) age"

Parameters not passed to BCS External List via REST API

I have two external lists connected via external content types which are connected to stored procedures in SQL Server. I believe I have them set up identically (though evidently not because one is not working).
the working procedure looks like this
select id = row_number() over (order by U.UserID)
   , UserIdValue = U.UserID
   , UserIdDisplay = '@userId=' + @userId
   , SiteIdValue = U.SiteID
   , SiteIdDisplay = U.SiteID
from User_Site U
INNER JOIN Final_Site F On F.SiteID=U.SiteID
where U.UserID = coalesce(@userId,U.UserID)

and when I call it through the REST API like this
var listName = 'SiteListForUser'
var itemType = ""SP.Data."" + listName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + listName.split("" "").join("""").slice(1) + ""ListItem"";
    var item = {
        ""__metadata"": { ""type"": itemType }
        };

$.ajax({
type: 'GET',
contentType: ""application/json;odata=verbose"",
url: ""myUrl/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('SiteListForUser')/items?$filter=(SiteIdValue eq 'aSiteId') and (UserIdValue eq 'MyUserName')&$top=200"",
data: JSON.stringify(item),
headers: {
    ""Accept"": ""application/json;odata=verbose"",
    },
async: ""false"",
success: function (data) {
           console.log(data);

        }

});

data.d.results has one record (as expected) and it is
{
   [functions]:,
   __metadata: { },
   AttachmentFiles: { },
   BdcIdentity: ""_bunchofnumbers"",
   ContentType: { },

so far so good. Now my second stored procedure looks like this
select top 2000 id = ROW_NUMBER() over (order by U.UserId, U.SiteId, F.TaskId)
   , UserIdValue = U.UserID
   , UserIdDisplay = '@userId=' + @userId

Senore, I've been really interested in this one, but I have a hard time with orientals...I find they're often too opulent, formal and downright ""fancy"" for my tastes and personality.

Would you describe Jaipur as opulent, formal, and fancy (understanding I'm not using these words with a negative connotation)?

Re: Cinnamon cookie dipped in vanilla

I know Musc Ravageur is very much loved here, I have a hard time getting beyond the Band-Aid smell it opens with. The first time I wore it, the Band-Aid scent was gone within minutes, and I hit the beautiful vanilla scent. The second time, I never reached the vanilla stage...the Band-Aid stayed with me for hours. Major bummer that day.

I'm sort of on a hunt for a similar scent. Of the ones I've tried, Jaipur isn't bad. I've worn it once and enjoyed it.

Like so many people, I was a huge fan of the late actor and comedian Robin Williams and heartbroken to hear of his passing. Not only could Robin's stand-up comedy make me laugh until I cried, he starred in one of my all-time favorite films, Dead Poets Society. If you are a writer and have not seen this movie, put it on your list to screen soon. (More on that below.) For today, because this is a recipe blog, I am sharing a happy memory of Robin when he appeared on The Martha Stewart Show back in 2006. You won't want to miss his comedic chef act. And the recipe he makes with Martha is a delicious one. I'm posting a very slightly adapted version for you to try at home.

1/2 teaspoon espresso powder (See my note on this ingredient

Suggested use on:1 1/2 pounds skirt steak

Cleo’s version of Martha’s
and Robin’s process:

Step 1 - Here's the rub (heh-heh): After tossing the crushed garlic with salt, make a paste. Here’s how to do it. On a firm, flat surface (such as a cutting board or clean counter top), put the flat side of the blade on top of the garlic and press down as you pull the blade toward you. Repeat this a few times until you see a paste forming. Move this paste to a small bowl. Measure in the chili powder, brown sugar, paprika, cumin, pepper, espresso powder (aka instant espresso), and the remaining tablespoon of salt. Stir this mixture until combined. You now have your rub!

Step 2 – Prep the steak: Rub the mixture all over the skirt steak (both sides), and place the steak in a large plastic bag. Marinate the meat for 30 minutes at room temperature. (Note: You can"

462,14,755,"Poll: Who Should Be Manchester United’s Starting Goalkeeper?

Manchester United recently lost to Liverpool in a very closely contested match at Anfield. The last goal by Kuyt, in my eyes, was easily stoppable if de Gea would have divede to smother the ball with confidence instead of whatever it was he did.

Notice I said WITH CONFIDENCE. David de Gea at many points looked very nervous not just against Liverpool but all season long. At one time, many would have been willing to give him a free pass because he is young and new to playing in the EPL, but now the excuses are running out. Considering the defensive issues that have plagued Manchester United this season, de Gea should be stepping up to do his part. Instead, fans have seen shocking losses come at the expense of his nervousness and let’s face it, when teams sense a nervous player, they will take to it like a shark takes to blood in the water. It was evident against Liverpool. After Kuyt scored the second goal, Liverpool looked hungry to finally put MUFC away even with 2 minutes left.

Anders Lindergaard has slowly but surely gotten more starts than de Gea and sooner or later Sir Alex will have to choose. It’s becoming clearer that Lindergaard is a better choice. He is confident, calm and clear minded. He communicates well with his defense and it shows. In his short stint at starting goalkeeper, he already has 7 clean sheets to de Gea’s 5. But it seems like de Gea has the advantage of youth and potential on his side and he was a big transfer coming in and that is what is blocking Lindergaard from being the number 1. Having said that, Lindergaard is now out for four weeks with an ankle injury.

Regardless, SAF has to decide who his number 1 will be going forward this term if he wants to be number 1 for a 20th time in the end.

I’m about as massive a United supporter one from the states, (who’s never had the privilege or money to actually go to England to experience them in person) can be. Goalkeeper was my position throughout my youth and now at a competitive adult city league. While I think most if not all of your criticisms of De Gea’s performance have merit, I think United’s defense should be equally to blame.

The decision to take off Scholes to go for the win was in hindsight an obvious mistake. It changed the game. United had full control up until that point. The change visibly gave Liverpool life, because they were seeing a lot more of the ball, and being at Anfield, that makes a difference in crowd expectation. Once United got it to 1-1, I felt that they’d either nick a goal in the same vein as Park’s and at worse they’d go to OT for a replay and win easily and advance.

The story for me is less about De Gea and more about United’s “bigger” players in the center. They got man handled by Faye and Ba at St. James’ Park and Andy Caroll dominated them last Sunday. Vidic is sorely missed on occasions where opposing teams have bigger forward players.

De Gea is 6’4″ but weighs under 170lbs according to ESPNsoccernet. I play keeper (in a competitive adult league in the city I live in). I’m 6’4″ and weigh 225 and"

464,5,16330,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling the air-fuel ratio demanded by a fuel controller in order to maintain optimum performance of a catalytic converter.
Three way catalytic converters are used to reduce exhaust emission of nitrous oxides (NOx) hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). In a steady sate of operation the performance of the catalyst in removing these pollutants is at an optimum level when the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is within a narrow range, close to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio.
Conventionally, a fuel controller is used to control the air fuel ratio demand from an engine based on feedback from an air fuel ratio sensor upstream of a catalytic converter in the exhaust passage. In other known control systems two air-fuel ratio sensors are used, one upstream of the catalytic converter, and one downstream of the catalytic converter.
In one example of such fuel control schemes, the air fuel ratio demand is increased until the air fuel ratio sensor detects that the ratio demand is too lean, whereupon the requested air fuel ratio is switched to request the stoichiometric air fuel ratio, and gradually decreased until the air fuel ratio sensor detects that the ratio demand is too rich. In other examples, when the air fuel ratio becomes too rich or too lean the requested air fuel ratio is switched to request an air fuel ratio which is half way between the maximum and minimum air fuel ratios which have caused previous switching.
This invention provides a method and apparatus for operating an improved fuel control scheme in which exhaust emission of pollutants are reduced.
According to the present invention there is provided a fuel control system comprising a first sensor arranged to measure an air fuel ratio upstream of a catalyst; a second sensor arranged to measure an air fuel ratio downstream of the catalyst; a catalyst model arranged to determine oxygen storage characteristics of the catalyst; a catalyst model arranged to estimate an oxygen storage value of the catalyst in dependence upon the measured air fuel ratio upstream of the catalyst, upon the measured air fuel ratio downstream of the catalyst and upon the determined oxygen storage characteristics of the catalyst; a controller for requesting an air fuel ratio according to a switching value derived from the estimated oxygen storage value of the catalyst, in which the controller is arranged to perform the following steps
a) request a maximum ratio of air to fuel when the switching value is less than a first threshold;
b) gradually decrease the requested air to fuel ratio from said maximum ratio;
c) request a minimum ratio of air to fuel when the switching value is greater than a second threshold; and
d) gradually increase the requested air to fuel ratio from said minimum ratio.
There is a time delay between changing the air fuel ratio demand, and the resulting change in the estimated oxygen storage value which means that if the air fuel ratio demand is changed due to the estimated oxygen storage value reaching a predetermined threshold then that predetermined threshold will be exceeded, or xe2x80x98overshotxe2x80"

However, because lawfully admitted aliens develop ties that go with permanent residence, their constitutional status changes, and they are entitled to greater protection under the Due Process Clause. Id. at 1154. See also id. at 1154 n. 6 (referring to the foregoing principle as the ""assimilation doctrine"").
Having noted that the first question in substantive due process analysis is a careful description of the asserted right, the court rejected the government's description of the right as the right to be released into the United States pending removal. Rather, the right is the fundamental interest in liberty generally. Id. at 1154. Because the described right is fundamental, the questioned government action is subject to ""strict scrutiny,"" meaning that ""a deprivation will comport with due process only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest."" Id. at 1154-1155 (citation omitted).
Applying this standard, the court looked at the asserted government goals in detaining deportable criminal aliens and whether the detention is excessive in light of those goals. It also examined the goals in the context of the government's (or at least the political branches') usual plenary authority over immigration matters. It rejected a more deferential standard because *490 there was no need to extend such deference beyond the deportation order, as the governmental interests asserted (prevention of flight and protection of the public) are domestic, and not foreign policy, matters. Id. at 1155. The court concluded that, balanced against the likelihood that the government would effectuate removal and the dangerousness of the individual alien, the detention of an alien did not comport with substantive due process when there is no realistic chance that the alien will be removed.

468,6,9775," Supervisors of Du Page County passed an ordinance disagreeing with the findings and recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals and granting the special use permit with restrictions. The restrictions imposed were as follows:
""(1) There shall be no buildings, structures or activity areas within 100 feet from the east residential property line.
(2) That the miniature golf course be moved to the westerly portion of the property.
(3) That there will be no development or structures within the flood plain area unless an area equal to that which is filled is provided on the site.
(4) The hours of operation shall be limited to 10:00 A.M. and 10:00 P.M., Monday through Thursday, and between 10:00 A.M. and 12 midnight on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.""
As a consequence of that legislative action this suit was filed.
Four issues have been raised by the plaintiffs for our consideration on this appeal. First, whether the legislative procedure followed by the Du Page County Board of Supervisors was improper or illegal. Second, whether the Riedys are barred from utilizing the subject property for any use other than residential by their insertion of restrictive covenants into the deeds to certain lots in the same subdivision when those lots were sold by the Riedys to some of the plaintiffs or their predecessors in title. Third, whether the Du Page County Zoning Ordinance, which allows golf driving ranges as a special use in certain single-family zoning districts, is improper. Fourth, whether the special use permit involved here is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable and without any relation to the public health, safety or welfare.
 1 We turn initially to the propriety of the legislative procedure *234 utilized in the passage of the special use permit ordinance here. We need not, however, consider the merits of the plaintiffs' contention in this regard. As we stated in the case of First National Bank & Trust Co. v. City of Rockford (1977), 47 Ill.

""It is fundamental that a party may not urge for the first time on appeal, and for the purposes of overturning the decision below, an argument or theory which was not presented to the trial court.""
The record here fails to disclose any evidence that the plaintiffs presented argument concerning the propriety of the legislative procedure for the consideration of the trial court. As this matter has been raised and argued for the first time on appeal, we will not consider it.

475,3,29289,"Arpaio's high numbers, while impressive, are countywide; Goddard's numbers, statewide. However, ABC15 equates the two in a recent report, making it seem as if Arpaio's numbers are actually from across Arizona, thereby tapping him as a viable candidate for governor against the Attorney General, whom most expect will be he Democratic nominee.

""A poll came out this week that measured several state official's approval ratings,"" writes ABC15 correspondent Dave Biscobing. ""Arpaio easily beat several other possible Republican candidates, and the only person who fared better was Democrat Terry Goddard at more than 70 percent approval. At this point, other recent polls show Goddard wins big against any Republican. But the Attorney General's name hasn't been tested against Arpaio.""

Arpaio, obviously, is not a state official. And Cronkite/Eight's press release concerning these latest results make it clear that only ""Maricopa County voters"" were asked to rate Arpaio's performance. To make this even clearer, the questions dealing with Arpaio are marked in bold and all-caps on the release, ""IF MARICOPA COUNTY.""

To be absolutely sure, I called Cronkite/Eight pollster Bruce Merrill, who confirmed that Cronkite/Eight did not poll statewide for Arpaio's approval ratings for two reasons: Arpaio is not a state official; and two, Arpaio is not a likely candidate for governor.

""If he were going to run, then we would definitely ask voters statewide how they feel about that,"" Merrill told me. ""The problem is Joe doesn't get as much exposure, obviously, in some of the rural counties.""

Merrill said he believed Arpaio's statewide numbers would be high, especially of those who had an opinion of him. But he explained that Cronkite/Eight had not done such polling. Also, Merrill said that he does not believe Arpaio will run for governor.

""I doubt that he will,"" opined the pollster. ""Joe likes press coverage, so if saying he's going to run for governor gets him more press coverage, he's going to consider it. But he isn't going to run. His problem, if he ran statewide, would be that he would really have to demonstrate to the public that he's more than a one-issue candidate.

""He's very much identified with illegal immigration and crime. When you run for governor, you have to deal with education and transportation and health, all kinds of things. Whether or not Joe would be willing to invest in learning all of that, I don't know, but I think in the past that he would have to broaden himself quite a bit, so my guess is that he will not run.""

Merrill said he's been through this sort of speculation concerning Arpaio running for governor ""hundreds of times,"" and so far, Arpaio's not thrown his hat in the ring. Though there's no doubt Joe loves the hype.

""Arpaio's dumb like a fox,"" noted Merrill, who also observed that Arpaio's support increases with the age of the voters involved.

""The older a person is, we've found, the more they like Joe,"" said Merrill. ""Like in Maricopa County, let's say he gets a 65 percent rating overall. If you went out into Sun City, or out into the retirement communities in the East Valley, his rating is somewhere up around 75 or 80 percent.""

And those voters who love Joe tend to lap up his reactionary, get-tough rhetoric.

""Not only do they like his position on illegal immigration,"" observed Merrill. ""They even like the way he says it. Where some people might think he's bombastic, and kind of off-the-wall or something, the average guy who's concerned about illegal immigration or crime, he wants someone who talks the way he does. He wants someone who says, `I'm gong to go kick these people in the ass and hang 'em.'""

Heh. And who said old folks were nice?

Of course, Arpaio's ego is further inflated by the musings of some in the press, but I agree with Merill that he will not run. Arpaio is a figurehead, the MCSO godfather who keeps all of his ne'"

484,23,11354,"The present invention relates to assembly structure of weather strips installed along door opening edges of retractable roof vehicles including convertible vehicles or hard top vehicles, that make elastic contact with door glasses for sealing outside and inside of vehicles.
FIG. 5 is an external view of one type of retractable roof vehicles of which roofs that open and close are folded to open. The roof includes a soft top 1 which is folded and put away in a trunk 2 on a lower rear side of a vehicle. Another roof of the retractable roof vehicle includes a roof panel and a back window panel at the back of the roof panel instead of the soft top 1, which are folded and put away in the trunk 2 while the roof panel as folded is piled on the back window panel. Such vehicles are generally called retractable hard top, coupe cabriolet or coupe convertible.
In the retractable roof vehicle, as shown in FIG. 6, a front pillar 3 and the soft top 1 as an opening edge of a door 2 have a weather strip 20 fit in a retainer 10 installed on side edges thereof. The weather strip 20 makes elastic contact with a door glass (side glass) 5 that lifts or lowers when the door 2 is closed to seal outside and inside of the vehicle.
The weather strip 20 includes: an installation base member 21 fit between an outer-cabin side holding part 10a and an inner-cabin side holding part 10b formed on the retainer 10; a hollow part 22 disposed between an inner-cabin side end 21b and a center of the installation base member 21; a hollow outer seal 23 integrally molded with an outer-cabin side of the installation base member 21, which makes elastic contact with an upper edge and an outer-cabin side surface of the door glass 5 that lifts or lowers when the door 2 is closed; and a lip-like inner seal 24 integrally molded with an outer-cabin side of the hollow part 22, which makes elastic contact with an inner-cabin side surface of the door glass 5 when the door 2 is closed. The hollow part 22 has a lip 25 on an inner-cabin side thereof which abuts interior material (not shown) including garnish. The hollow part 22 is a watercourse for draining water guided therein outside a vehicle on a front side of the vehicle.
In this connection, the Japanese examined Utility Model Publication No. H03-15401 discloses a structure that the outer seal and the inner seal of the weather strip installed on the retainer makes elastic contact with the outer-cabin side surface and the inner-cabin side surface of the door glass that lifts or lowers.
According to the ordinary weather strip 20 of FIG. 6, as the door glass 5 is guided upward as shown in FIG. 7, the inner seal 24 which makes elastic contact with the inner-cabin side of the door glass 5 is pulled toward the installation base member 21 side. On the other hand, as the door glass 5 is guided downward in a direction of an arrow in FIG. 7, that is as the door glass 5 is lowered, the inner seal 24 is dragged by the door glass 5, thereby generating tensile force lowering a central pillar 22A which connects with the inner seal 24. The tensile force is transmitted in a direction of lowering (downward in FIG. 7) an intermediate part 21c of the installation base member 21 between the hollow part 22 and the outer seal 23 via the central pillar 22A forming the hollow part 22. As a result, there has remained a problem that holding force of the weather strip 20 relative to the retainer 10 is decreased. In a worse case, an outer-cabin side end 21a or the inner-c"

Colorado Springs, Colorado

Following the completion of its July 28-Aug. 1 training camp in Las Vegas, USA Basketball National Team Managing Director Jerry Colangelo today announced that 16 players have been selected finalists for the 2014 USA Basketball Men’s World Cup Team roster. The USA National Team is scheduled to resume its 2014 preparations for the FIBA Basketball World Cup on Aug. 14 in Chicago.

The finalists include three Olympic gold medalists from 2012 - Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), Kevin Durant (Oklahoma City Thunder) and James Harden (Houston Rockets); three 2010 World Championship gold medalists – Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors); Durant and Derrick Rose (Chicago Bulls); and the addition of Mason Plumlee (Brooklyn Nets) to the 2014-16 USA National Team roster and to the list of finalists participating in Chicago. Plumlee began the Las Vegas training camp as a member of the 2014 USA Select Team.

Selected USA World Cup Team finalists were DeMarcus Cousins (Sacramento Kings); Curry; Davis; DeMar DeRozan (Toronto Raptors); Andre Drummond (Detroit Pistons); Durant; Kenneth Faried (Denver Nuggets); Harden; Gordon Hayward (Utah Jazz); Kyrie Irving (Cleveland Cavaliers); Kyle Korver (Atlanta Hawks); Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers); Chandler Parsons (Dallas Mavericks); Plumlee; Rose; and Klay Thompson (Golden State Warriors).

“The ending to our Las Vegas training camp with the injury to Paul George was very emotional for everyone involved in USA Basketball. I very much appreciate the outpouring of support Paul and USA Basketball has received the past couple of days from the basketball world. Past Olympic coaches and some of our past Olympic and World Championship players have reached out offering their continued support and that’s very important. Paul’s injury was an extremely unfortunate occurrence; it was truly a freak accident. We’re all very pleased that his recovery is going well,” said Colangelo

“We have always approached representing our country as a privilege, a tremendous honor, and USA Basketball is very appreciative of the willingness of our players to play for the United States and in their own patriotic way give back to their country. Historically, the players involved in USA Basketball have become better players because of their experience. They have treasured their USA Basketball experience, as well as the incredible opportunity and honor it has been for them to demonstrate their patriotism and represent their country.

“Their willingness to represent the United States says a lot about our players' patriotism and their willingness to sacrifice their time to this commitment. Not every American has the opportunity to represent their country and our players have embraced each opportunity to do it. They have worn the USA jersey with respect and honor, and by their commitment they have made all Americans extremely proud.”

Biography
Born in South Norwalk, Connecticut, Taylor attended the common schools, an early precursor to the public education system. He enlisted for the Mexican–American War as a captain in the First Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry, August 1, 1846, and was sent to California in 1846 just before the outbreak of the war. He was honorably mustered out September 18, 1848. He remained in California and engaged in business at Stockton. He briefly served as member of the first inaugural California Senate from San Joaquin from December 15, 1849 to February 13, 1850. He won a seat in the California Senate with 16.6% of the vote. While serving he voted for the expansion of the California government and advocated for a transcontinental railroad that would connect California to the East Coast. He was expelled from the California Senate on February 13, 1850 due to an excessive absence while attending to business concerns in New York City. He was expelled “without any reflection upon his character.” Upon returning to California he served as the President of the Board of Trustees for the State Insane Asylum from 1850-1856.Taylor was elected sheriff of San Joaquin County in 1855. Nelson resigned his positions in 1856 and moved back to New York City after having made many political connections in California.

He moved to New York City in 1856, then attended Harvard University. He graduated from the law department of Harvard University in 1860. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law in New York City"

4. Minimize Fear

We have a sleeping bag, a few boots and gloves and other miscellaneous camping equipment in the back of my car. The thing is, the camping trip we packed for was over a year ago.

And so here I am hauling camping equipment around in my car wherever I go. There’s a lesson here because sometimes we take emotional clutter where it’s not needed as well. Fear is one such piece of junk we often haul around unnecessarily.

You can’t completely eliminate fear and probably shouldn’t. It’s a handy device to have when contemplating a casual swim in shark-infested waters. Recklessness, after all, is the total absence of fear, not the presence of courage. But don’t let fear control you. Courage is taking right action in spiteof being afraid. Still, the intensity of fear can and often should be reduced in those who become overwhelmed with anxiety over the object of their fears. This is particularly true when those fears are not rational.

Fearing a lion, for instance, while strolling through the Serengeti alone, munching on some fried chicken, can be a rational fear. Fearing a lion in Central Park is not. Fearing shark attack while splashing around the Great Barrier Reef is rational. Fearing shark attack while swimming at night in the backyard pool is not.

As you buckle down and move forward despite your fears, you will usually come to realize the fear itself was much larger than the reality of it.

5. Minimize Pessimism

I don’t know how many trash bags of old clothes we’ve given to charity over the years. We don’t ask for anything in return. We simply give it away. That’s a strategy we can use for our habits of negative thinking too. Give it all away. Don’t hold on to it for another"
495,26,18059,"11 Factors Affecting Loan Against Property

Introduction

Indian mortgage industry is poised for a higher growth and is expected to grow five-fold in the next 10 years. As per LIVEMINT, the mortgage market is worth Rs.12 trillion and its market has been growing at a fairly robust pace over the past decade.

Loan against property is one of the best loan modules which help the customers to capitalize the financial value of their property. The borrower can use the loan for meeting his personal needs, funding children’s higher education, for business startup or business expansion.

The term Mortgage Loan or LAP is used interchangeably for a loan against property frequently in the finance industry.

Key Factors That Affect Loan against Property

1. INSURANCE : Mortgage insurance lowers the risk for both lender and borrowers. The fund provider feels more confident while extending credit, when a customer is ready to avail insurance. We advise you to take an insurance cover as it will lessen the burden on your family under unfortunate circumstances.

2. TENURE : A longer tenure helps a borrower to increase the eligibility of the loan. Inversely speaking, a shorter tenure will help you to save a lot of money on the interest part.

Your age also plays an important part in deciding tenure of the loan. If the borrower’s age is on the lower side, then earning co-applicant is taken. On the other hand, if borrower’s age is on the higher side, then lender offers a term, which will end up before his/her retirement.

3. COMPARE DEALS : Getting a LAP is no more a tough task if you meet all credit parameters. But the main concern among customers is to decide whether to choose a bank, NBFC or any other alternate source for the loan. Either you can physically visit these financial institutions or search online. Post this, you can compare all available options & choose the best deal for yourself which suits your needs.

4. AGE OF PROPERTY : Suppose, if the age of your property is of 10 years, and as per credit policy of lender, the maximum age limit of the property allowed is 20 years. Then, the loan tenure cannot
exceed 10 years.

If your building is old, but you have made renovations recently then it will have a positive impact on your loan application.

5. PATTA CASES : Some property owners have only the patta and do not have other relevant approvals or title deeds. In these types of cases, a loan application is rejected without much of a
consideration.

6. INADEQUATE ITR’S : If you are self employed, then usually lender will ask for recent 3 years Income Tax Returns (ITR’s). Suppose, you have filed only 1 or 2 IT returns. But you can show supporting bank statements &amp; other relevant documents, which will prove your regular flow of income, and then it is sometimes it is considered by certain lenders.

7. REGULAR FLOW OF INCOME : The loan applicant should have a regular source of income. It helps to ensure that EMI will be paid consistently. So, the lender does not have to worry about the stage of default. The process of recovering of money from selling the pledged property is actually very rigorous &amp; exhaustive one.

8. TYPE OF CHARGES : Apart from regular interest rates, there are other types of charges borne by the customer such as loan processing fee, renewal charges, pre closure charges, sales tax, etc. You must add these charges, before arriving at the final decision of availing the loan.

9. CO-APPLICANT : All the co-owners of property are supposed to give their consents before a loan application. A co-applicant can be your spouse, parents or children. If you don’t have a decent credit score, then it is better to apply with a co-app"
496,16,14739,"Dimanche, les Turcs se prononceront sur la réforme constitutionnelle visant à renforcer les pouvoirs du président Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Un référendum à l'issue indécise.

La Turquie adoptera-t-elle un régime hyperprésidentiel? C'est tout l'enjeu du référendum de dimanche où 55,3 millions d'électeurs sont appelés à voter «oui» ou «non» à la révision constitutionnelle. Si le «oui» l'emportait, il acterait le renforcement des pouvoirs du président Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Une bascule qui remodèlerait le système politique du pays et redéfinir ses relations avec l'Occident. Le ministre allemand des Finances Wolfgang Schäuble, poids lourd du gouvernement d'Angela Merkel, a évoqué mardi le risque d'une dictature en cas de victoire du «oui».

Au pouvoir jusqu'en 2029?

Le référendum porte sur une révision constitutionnelle prévoyant notamment l'abolition du poste de Premier ministre au profit d'un hyperprésident qui concentrera entre ses mains de vastes prérogatives.

Le gouvernement présente cette réforme comme indispensable pour doter l'État d'un exécutif stable et rompre définitivement avec les fragiles gouvernements de coalition des années 1980 et 1990, avant l'arrivée au pouvoir de l'AKP, le parti islamo-conservateur de M. Erdogan.

Mais ses détracteurs y voient une nouvelle dérive autoritaire d'un homme qu'ils accusent de chercher à museler toute voix critique, surtout après la tentative de coup d'État du 15 juillet par des militaires factieux.

M. Erdogan, 63 ans, a occupé le poste de Premier ministre entre 2003 et 2014 avant d'être élu président, une fonction censée être largement protocolaire. Aux termes de la révision constitutionnelle, il pourrait rester au pouvoir jusqu'en 2029.

Les analystes prévoient un résultat serré, malgré une nette domination de la campagne du «oui» dans les médias. Donné large vainqueur dans la foulée du putsch avorté, M. Erdogan aborde le référendum alors que la donne lui semble nettement moins favorable dans une Turquie éprouvée par une série d'attentats imputés à la rébellion kurde ou au groupe État islamique et que l'économie, un pilier de sa popularité, s'essouffle.

Des purges dans la société

Les principales incertitudes pour M. Erdogan résident dans le vote des Kurdes, représentant un cinquième de la population, et celui du camp de la droite nationaliste, dont la base est divisée.

The cost of fixing the potholes on the road to my humble abode.

Truly. I’m not making this up. Pot-hole repair is part of their “post-tax energy subsidy” that they claim is going to the energy companies. It’s listed under the rubric of “non-carbon externalities”.

And what are “non-carbon externalities” when they are at home? I thought you’d never ask. Fortunately, they give examples, viz:

“(congestion, accidents, air pollution, and road damage)”.

In the strange IMF parallel universe, the cost of fixing each of those (including “road damage”) is considered as a SUBSIDY TO EXXON AND SHELL! Fixing potholes as a subsidy to the energy companies! Have you ever heard such a daft thing?

So let me engage in a bit of technical jargon here myself. I’m going to refer to those subsidies that flow only to energy producers and distributors and that affect the bottom line of those subsidized producers and distributors as “real energy subsidies”. It’s a catchy name, I like the ring of it, cuts to the heart of the matter.

And for things like say claiming that fixing potholes is a subsidy to the energy industry? Well, for those types I’ll use the term “imaginary energy subsidies”, it’s short and to the point.

As for the relative size of real and imaginary subsidies, the big headline news from the paper has been making its way around the web under headlines like “Energy subsidies are $5.3 trillion dollars per year!” Well, let me point out that their number is ninety-four percent imaginary energy subsidies, and is only six percent real energy subsidies. Strange but true. Like I said, I’m not making this up. Heck, I couldn’t imagine this level of absurd venality.

       In the present case, neither the words of Plaintiffs' verified complaint nor—as we will discuss

more—the remainder of the record before the district court forecloses the possibility that petroleum,

which had already leaked onto Defendants' property from the removed tanks, has continued to seep

onto Plaintiffs' property during Coleman's ownership of the former service station site. Unlike the

complaint, Defendant Coleman's answer is not under oath; but he denies wrongdoing. His denial,

of course, does nothing to undercut the fact that plaintiffs have set out an arguable nuisance claim

against him; the answer, at most, shows a controversy that needs to be resolved.

3. Defendants' Affidavits

       Defendants also submitted affidavits which say that—before Coleman's ownership of the

former service station site—the USTs were removed from the ground, and no petroleum products

have been since stored or sold at the property. In addition, Coleman specifically says in his

affidavit: ""I have never caused the release of any petroleum products at [Defendants'] property.""

(emphasis added).

       Coleman submitted the affidavits in support of his motion for summary judgment before the

district court ruled on Plaintiffs' motion for remand. Although submitted in support of a motion for

summary judgment, Defendants' affidavits were probably properly considered by the district court

on the question of remand; and we too will take them into account in deciding the limited question

of whether a possibility exists that Plaintiffs have stated a nuisance cause of action against Coleman.

See Cabalceta, 883 F.2d at 1561.

       Seemingly on the basis of Defendants' affidavits4, the district court found and concluded it

to be undisputed that: ""Since at least May 14, 1991, there have been... no petroleum releases from

argue was held on the motions in the district court. We know that, when motions are orally
argued (even when the pertinent hearing is for argument only and not one for the presentation of
evidence), important things sometimes happen which impact on the factual record—for example,
the judge while interrogating the lawyers obtains stipulations, concessions, and so on. But in
this case, no one has said the oral argument in district court amended the paper record. And the
transcript of the hearing in the district court is not part of the appellate record. So, we believe we
are looking at the same factual record that was before the district court.
the site"" (emphasis added). If ""release,"" as used by the district court, means no seepage or leakage

onto Plaintiffs' land,5 we cannot see how that fact can be said to be undisputed from the paper record

before the district court and us. Coleman's affidavit and Plaintiffs' sworn complaint seem to leave

open—as completely disputed—whether gasoline from Coleman's land (after he became the

landowner) has intruded, and continues to intrude, onto Plaintiffs' land. By the way, we note that

Plaintiffs—before the district court ruled on the summary judgment motion—filed, pursuant to the

district court's local rules, a ""Statement of Material Facts to Which There Remains a Genuine Issue

to Be Tried,"" which included this statement: ""Gasoline continues to leak from the contaminated

property owned by Coleman onto the property of the Plaintiffs.""

       In the light of the ostensible dispute of fact appearing in the documents in the

record—including those under oath—summary judgment for defendant Coleman was very possibly

erroneous. But, as a reviewing court, we need not go so far as to say summary judgment was

wrongfully entered. We can just say (and we do say with more certainty) that the motion for remand

was improperly denied.

500,18,5832,"Chickens in the City – Practical Advice on Managing an Urban Coop and the Neighbors

August 13, 2012 | Minda Berbeco

Chickens pecking at your toes? Fresh eggs daily? Sounds like rural living. With the rise of the urban locavore movement, though, poultry are becoming commonplace in cities all over the country.

When Khrysti Smyth first started keeping chickens in her urban yard in Somerville Massachusetts, it was not only for the fresh eggs, but to reconnect with nature.

“I have been a green living practitioner and advocate for my entire life,” she said, but after moving to Somerville and selling her car she found herself “city-locked”. She started to feel detached from nature and wanted to bring it back into her life.

For her, chicken keeping quickly became a natural antidote to city living.

As someone starting out with chickens in an urban environment, there were many practical questions to answer: How much would it cost? What would chickens do to the lawn? How would the neighbors react? Having successfully negotiated these muddy waters herself, Smyth has extended her love of the birds into a small business, helping other urbanites bring chickens into their homes. Now, she has some tips for you.

Costs and Coops: the practical side to chicken keeping

The greatest cost associated with chickens is the initial set up, including the coop. The trade off, Smyth says"

Silverstripe admin: ""Has one"" dropdown converts to ordinary input field after import

When I try to add a new ""package"" all the ""has one"" fields are there with a drop down (see screen shot 1). I also built an importer which imports these packages. When run, everything is looking fine, except when you open a package. Then 'Festival' is correctly coupled. You can see the name, and you can select the drop down. ""Troupe"", on the other hand, has mysteriously converted to an input field that only shows the id of the record in the other table (See screen shot 2).

What is the FEAR strategy?

My friend was telling me about the FEAR strategy while I was playing Pokemon Heart Gold. But he isn't sure what the FEAR strategy is, because he was playing this game long time ago and he doesn't remember the detail.
So, did this FEAR strategy really exist in Pokemon games or not? If so, what is FEAR strategy and how do I use it?

A:

FEAR strategy is probably not a great choice for a normal playthrough of the game.
It means: Focus Sash, Endeavor, Quick Attack, Rattata. The pokemon doesn't have to be a Rattata, but Rattata makes a good choice.
You'd make sure that your level 1 Rattata (or other pokemon who can learn this moveset) has a Focus Sash equipped. On your first turn of battle, you use Endeavor. Since you're level 1, your opponent is almost certainly going to out-speed you and one-shot you, but the Focus Sash keeps you alive with 1HP. Then, your Endeavor will bring your opponent to 1HP, since it sets your opponent's HP equal to yours.
On your second turn, you use Quick Attack, which allows you to attack first and deals at least 1 damage (because no damaging attack can deal less than 1 damage), which is enough to kill your opponent's pokemon.
It's a one-time-use gimmick to kill a single opponent's pokemon. The focus sash breaks afterwards, and even if you have another one, you'd still need to visit a poke-center or use items to full heal so that you can make use of the Focus Sash again.
More information on Bulbapedia.

A:

In a nutshell, the F.E.A.R strategy uses a low-level Pokemon to take advantage of the move Endeavor, which lowers an opposing Pokemon's health to your current health. Couple this with a way to survive One-Hit KOs (OHKOs) such as the item Focus Sash, and a way to deal the small amount of damage needed (a Priority move such as Quick Attack, Poison/Weather Damage etc) you can effectively 2-shot any Pokemon in the game. 
While the F.E.A.R strategy is named for Focus Sash, Endeavor, Quick Attack, Ratatta as StrixVaria has covered, there are other variants of the same strategy that do not use this exact combination of moves and items. You should check out this Reddit guide for a comprehensive look at the F.E.A.R Pokemon options. 
An Example
One of the better/more well known users of the strategy is actually Aron, which relies on either Sandstorm weather damage or Toxic Spikes to deal the final blow to the Pokemon, rather than a Priority move such as Quick Attack.

In the experimentally relevant limit $J'' \ll D \ll J$ of strong DM interaction the spins on the neighboring chains are forced to rotate in opposite directions, effectively resulting in a cancelation of the interchain interaction between components of spins in the plane normal to the vector ${\bm D}$. This has the effect of promoting two-dimensional collinear spin density wave (SDW) state, which preserves U(1) symmetry of rotations about the $\bm D$-axis. We also investigate response of this interesting system to an external magnetic field ${\bm h}$ and obtain the $h-D$ phase diagrams for the two important configurations, ${\bm h} \parallel {\bm D}$ and ${\bm h} \perp {\bm D}$.'

Introduction {#sec:introduction}
============

Many interesting quantum magnets are characterized by significant spatial anisotropy of the exchange interaction pattern and often can be understood as being built from one-dimensional spin chains. Several recent examples of these include triangular antiferromagnets Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ [@coldea2003] and Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$ [@Ono2005; @Ono2005b; @takano2009], actively investigated for their fractionalized spinon continuum and pronounced 1/3 magnetization plateau, correspondingly, and high-field candidate spin nematic materials such as LiCuVO$_4$ [@mourigal2012; @svistov2014] and PbCuSO$_4$(OH)$_2$ [@linarite2016; @povarov2016].

Quasi-one-dimensional nature of this class of materials is responsible for the hierarchy of temperature/energy scales when at high temperature, relative to the weak inter-chain exchange $J'$, the material exhibits mainly one-dimensional physics with little correlations between spins from different chains. Upon further cooling the inter-chain interactions become important and determine the ultimate ground state type of order that is realized below the ordering temperature $T_c \sim J'$[@schulz1996]. If the interchain interaction is geometrically frustrated, as for example happens in triangular [@olegandbalents] and kagome [@Schnyder2008] lattices, the ordering temperature may be further suppressed below the intuitive mean-field $T_c \sim J'$ estimate.

In the present work we describe novel mechanism of frustrating inter-chain spin exchange. We show that spin chains with strong uniform Dzy"

Acute hypoxia is a normal process in cells. It can be caused by extended exercise, inflammation or infection. The hypoxic response reestablishes oxygenation. In cancer cells the hypoxic response continues setting off a cascade of cellular responses through the activation of HIF thereby promoting proliferation and survival of cancer cells. We show here that methyl sulfone significantly reduced HIF-1α expression under hypoxia in metastatic breast and melanoma cells.

As tumors continue to grow, the oxygen partial pressure (pO~2~) drops in tumor cells thereby maintaining a hypoxic phenotype. The cellular response is to initiate angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a direct target of HIF. We show that methyl sulfone down regulated VEGF in the hypoxic environment of metastatic breast cancer cells.

In addition to needing oxygen, cancer cells require an enhanced energy source and a method of obtaining metabolites to synthesize amino acids, nucleic acids, and lipids to support newly accelerated cell growth. The shift in cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in the metastatic cell niche \[[@pone.0141565.ref019]\] is well established and began with the research of Otto Warburg \[[@pone.0141565.ref020]\]. The Warburg effect is the process in cancer cells whereby cells continue with aerobic glycolysis even when oxygen is present. The current understanding is that aerobic glycolysis allows cancer cells to switch from energy production to the synthesis of metabolites necessary for new cell growth and back again as demands change. We examined three glycolic proteins known to be involved with aerobic glycolysis and metastatic progression.

Pyruvate kinase isoform M1 (PKM1) is the tetrameric isoform that allows glucose in normal cells to enter the mitochondria and begin oxidative phosphorylation. PKM2, the dimeric form, supports the process of aerobic glycolysis. PKM2 is necessary for cancer cells to produce energy and synthesize metabolites for cell proliferation \[[@pone.0141565.ref021]\]. In contrast, the PKM2 isoform is only present in embryonic cells and cancer cells. In cancer cells, PKM2 levels increase under hypoxia. We show that methyl sulfone significantly decreased the level of PKM2 in two metastatic cell lines under hypoxic conditions.

In aerobic glycolysis the level of lactic acid is high due to diversion of pyruvate away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards production of lactic acid. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) breaks down lactic acid"
506,22,29674,"In this type of applications, the objective is to produce steel parts that combine high mechanical strength, good corrosion resistance and good weldability. It must also be possible to fabricate these hot stamped parts using high productivity methods. These requirements apply in particular in the automobile industry, where the objective is to reduce significantly the weight of the vehicles. Anti-intrusion parts or parts that play a role in the safety of automotive vehicles such as bumpers, door reinforcements or center pillars, for example, require the qualities indicated above. These qualities can be obtained in particular thanks to steel parts, the microstructure of which is martensitic or bainitic-martensitic.
The fabrication of parts of this type is known in particular from publications FR2780984 and FR2807447, according to which a blank cut in a steel sheet for heat treatment, pre-coated with a metal or metallic alloy, is heated in a furnace and then hot stamped. The pre-coating can be aluminum or an aluminum alloy, zinc or zinc alloy. During the heating in the furnace, this pre-coating alloys with the steel substrate to form a compound that provides protection of the surface of the steel against decarburization and the formation of scalet. This compound is suitable for hot forming. Holding the piece in the tool after forming makes a rapid cooling possible, which leads to the achievement of hardened microstructures in the steel substrate, which are associated with good mechanical characteristics of strength and hardness. This method is known as “press hardening”.
In a method of this type, the blanks are generally heated in continuous furnaces, whereby the blanks are moved forward in these furnaces on rollers. This phase comprises a heating step followed by a temperature hold in the furnace, generally at around 900-950° C. The hold temperature and the hold time are a function of, among other things, the thickness of the blanks and the type of pre-coating on the blanks. For productivity reasons, it is desirable to employ methods that make it possible to shorten the step of heating in the furnace as much as possible. In this regard, publication EP2312005 discloses a method in which a coil of steel with an aluminum pre-coating is provided and is then annealed at 600-750° C. for a period of time ranging from 1 hour to 200 hours. A diffusion of the iron from the substrate to the pre-coating occurs, to the point where a pre-alloy product is obtained. After cutting, these pre-alloyed blanks can be heated more rapidly, in particular on account of the emissivity modification caused by the pre-alloying treatment. However, this method requires a prior, time-consuming annealing of the coil.
Document EP2463395 also proposes to accelerate the kinetics of the heating phase by locally reducing the reflectivity of a blank by means of various methods: prior application of black paint, modification of surface roughness by shot blasting, by rolling, laser or immersion etching in an acid solution. This document also describes examples in which pigments in the aqueous phase or polyester/melamine based black paint in a solvent phase have been deposited on galvanized pre-coatings. Considering the conventional mixing rate: 90-92% polyester and 8-10% melamine (C15H30N6O6) in the paint layer after drying and a maximum pigment concentration by volume of 30%, the nitrogen content in the paint layer used in these tests is on the order of 1.7 to 2.4%% after drying. However, this method completely disregards certain essential problems linked to the later utilization of these parts. After hot stamping, the parts must be suitable for painting by cataphoresis, must be weldable and corrosion resistant. However, as will be shown below, the application of a conventional black paint that is resistant to high temperatures before hot stamping does not make it possible to obtain these properties.
Attempts have therefore been made to identify a method that makes it possible to simultaneously increase the productivity of the hot stamping process and to control the process so that the hot stamped and hardened parts thus obtained are compatible with conventional industrial production conditions, i.e. they do not require, for example, a modification of the existing settings of resistance spot welding machines for the assembly of these parts. This method must also be compatible with the fabrication of welded blanks pre-coated with an aluminum coating that requires prior ablation of a portion of the pre-coating on the"

As father to an 18-month-old toddler, I would love to know exactly what my son is thinking. Along with many parents, one of the ways I try to find out is to ask him questions of the variety “Do you want X or Y?” But does his answer to this type of question actually reveal his preference or is it a more a reflection of a quirky cognitive bias that is more powerful in children than adults?

Two competing effects influence how adults respond to binary choices. The first is called “The Primary Effect” which describes the way that the first option we hear tends to stick in our minds. For example, one study found that adults are more likely to choose “heads” when asked if a coin toss is going to be “heads or tails”. The second effect, which sometimes contrasts with the Primary Effect, is called “The Recency Effect”. This captures the way that the last thing we hear or experience can also have more weight in our memory (this is why popstars end their concerts on their best songs, so that everyone leaves thinking the whole gig was great). In adults, neither the Primary Effect or the Recency Effect is always the more pronounced, with evidence suggesting that one’s personality type, familiarity of the information, and how controversial the topic is, all play a mediating role.

Keen to test if the same is true in young children, or if one of the effects is more dominant, a team led by Emily Sumner conducted two experiments and published their findings in a recent paper in PLOS One fantastically titled “Cake or Broccoli: Recency Biases Children’s Verbal Responses”.

In the first experiment, they asked twenty-four toddlers a series of questions with two options for them to consider (i.e. “Should Rori bring a lunchbox or backpack to school?”). Later, after enough other questions had been asked to"

512,2,26548,"This invention relates generally to nucleic acid hybridization analysis. More specifically, an oligonucleotide probe for hybridization analysis is provided, that comprises a nucleotide sequence which, under suitable conditions, is capable of forming a hairpin structure. The double stranded segment of the hairpin structure is formed between two perfectly matched nucleotide sequences, and at least a portion of the nucleotide sequence within the double stranded segment is complementary to a target nucleotide sequence to be detected. An array of oligonucleotide probes immobilized on a solid support for hybridization analysis is also provided that comprises a solid support suitable for use in nucleic acid hybridization having immobilized thereon a plurality of oligonucleotide probes. The probes each comprise a nucleotide sequence which, under suitable conditions, is capable of forming a hairpin structure having a nucleotide sequence complementary to a target nucleotide sequence to be detected located within the double stranded segment. Methods for nucleic acid hybridization analysis using the probes or array of immobilized probes are additionally provided.
Nucleic acid hybridization, in the forty years since its discovery, has become a powerful tool with implications for biology, medicine and industry. Hybridization assays are based on the very specific base pairing that is found in hybrids of DNA and RNA. Base sequences of analytical interest appearing along a strand of nucleic acid can be detected very specifically and sensitively by observing the formation of hybrids in the presence of a probe nucleic acid known to comprise a base sequence that is complementary with the sequence of interest. Nucleic acid hybridization has been used for a wide variety of purposes including, for example, identification of specific clones from cDNA and genomic libraries, detecting single base pair polymorphisms"
513,1,5908,". Ledyard should be rejected on either of the three grounds above mentioned. No fixed period of immobilization was included in the hypothetical question. Apart from this, however, claimant's testimony is to the effect that after being in the hospital for twelve days, he was taken home where he remained in bed most of the time for several months. With reference to the second ground, it may be reasonably assumed that Dr. Ledyard knew the effect of the circumstances referred to and took them into consideration.
The most serious question is the contention that the stone formed prior to the accident. The employer and carrier say that this is conclusively shown by the testimony of Dr. P.L. Bates, a urologist, who attended claimant when he was hospitalized in Greenwood. He appears to have made a rather complete physical examination of him at the time of admission. He testified twice during the hearing as a witness for the employer and carrier. On his first examination he said that on May 9, 1958, the day of admission of claimant to the Greenwood Hospital, he made an intravenous pyelogram which ""showed both kidneys functioning normally""; that claimant returned to the hospital on May 31, 1958 complaining of passing blood clots in his urine; and that a further examination was then made, during the course *501 of which he looked at claimant's bladder with a cystoscope and there were no ""ulcerations, no tumors and no stones."" At his second appearance before the hearing Commissioner, Dr. Bates testified that on May 9, 1958 an intravenous pyelogram was taken and that the x-rays disclosed ""a small crescent shaped stone in the left kidney."" He said that later he made a cystoscopic examination of the bladder which disclosed no stone in that area. He admitted on cross examination that in his report covering almost three pages he made no mention of finding the kidney stone because he deemed that fact ""not pertinent to this patient's clinical picture.""
The only other testimony relating to the discovery of the stone was by Dr. Barron who testified that an x-ray examination made by him on September 11, 1958 disclosed a questionable shadow in the region of the left kidney and a further examination on March 12, 1959 proved this to be a stone.
We think the apparently conflicting statements of Dr. Bates raised an issue of fact for determination by the Industrial Commission as to the presence of a stone when claimant was examined at the Greenwood Hospital. We cannot say as a matter of law that there was no evidence to support the facts stated in the hypothetical question propounded to Dr. Ledyard.
Finally, it is contended that when considered as a whole, the testimony of Dr. Ledyard is insufficient to establish a causal connection between the original injury and the formation of the stone. It is argued that his testimony on direct examination that immobilization was ""a large factor"" or a ""contributing factor"" in the production of the stone was nullified by his later statement on cross examination that he did not see how anyone could definitely say"
514,12,16997,"Better Email Prioritization Going Mainstream?

from the maybe-possibly dept

For years, we've been hearing stories about how email overload was a problem. One potential solution that is often brought up is the idea of better prioritization of email. Rather than just a time-based list, shouldn't our computers be smart enough to recognize which emails are likely to be more important? There have been a number of projects that try to do this, with varying degrees of success -- but none have gone very far outside of small numbers of users. However, it appears that Microsoft is trying to get into the game, with a relatively simple prioritization system, based on separating out the emails of people you regularly email with, on the assumption that they're more likely to be important than other emails. Again, this isn't a new idea, but having Microsoft actually implement it suggests that it may finally break into the mainstream. The real question, though, is whether or not people have already become so conditioned to traditional email (including their own tricks for email management) that they'll see this system as screwing things up more than helping.

Remote Action Interface - RAI

I wrote the following artice a couple of years back. Feedback is greatly appreciated, it relates nicely to ""smart"" email.

Remote Action Interface (RAI)As the Internet expands due to the addition of new systems, applications and users the need for efficient communication between all these entities increases. The Remote Action Interface Architecture (RAI) achieves loose coupling among internet entities. Any system which is network addressable is considered an entity. In order to simplify entity to entity communication there is a need to abstract away the complexity of the network. By eliminating the knowledge of the network from the implementation layer the RAI architecture is able to move data from one entity to another seamlessly. Implementing a solution built on the principles of Remote Action Interface (RAI) provides the ability for entities to self manage their own data without human intervention.Within the RAI Architecture there are three classifications actions, entity and containers. The classifications are organized in a hierarchical tree structure. All leaf nodes are entities while all paths starting from the tree root (domain) are containers.Actions:The four basic actions which can be preformed on an entity are view, delete, update, and add. From these four actions additional actions can be derived. Data sent to entity is contained within xml tags.Syntax: action@Entity:The entity defines what time of actions it will perform. The entity must reside within a container.Syntax: action@entityContainer:Containers hold zero or more entities. The classification changes between entity and container depending on the manner in which the entity or container is being referenced.Syntax: action@entity.containerRAI DefinitionA request is sent to discovery@entity.container the response is a RAI definition, which lists all entities and actions. ::= {[public | private] ”;”[public | private] ”;”}”;” ::= entity ::= action ::= {letter | digit}*.{letter | digit}* ::= {letter | digit}*.{letter | digit}*RAI Architecture ImplementationRAI ServerToday the communication and programming are two distinct layers. The RAI server functions as a mail and web server, which allows fusion of the network and the implementation layers. The RAI server is not able to hold the requester’s state information; therefore security access verification is done on each request.RAI Language ExtensionIn order to support the paradigm shift in computing architecture, programming languages must support embedded communication. Data within the application is passed to method using either the RAI request or conventional memory stack.Current language constructObject.method(parameter1, parameter2);Future language constructview@entity.com;view@entity.container.com;RAI RequestThe first interaction directed to a entity is the RAI discovery request sent to discovery@entity.com.

1. CASE REPORT {#ccr31608-sec-0001}
==============

A 24‐year‐old Caucasian man presented with a several month history of muscle pain, fatigue and insidious onset of pitting edema to his lower extremities. His symptoms progressed to include bilateral arm swelling, muscle pain to the thenar eminence of both hands, and paresthesias to his hands. He did not have a rash, joint pain, Raynaud phenomenon, oral ulcers, fever, hardening of the skin or weight loss, and he denied any cardiac, respiratory, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Prior to symptom onset, he had traveled to South America and reported possible ingestion of undercooked meat as well as swimming in a river and lake. He had frequent visits to the Northeastern United States and had recently spent an extended period of time outdoors in Rhode Island. Medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable, and he was not taking any medications. He had a history of mild alcohol intake, no history of smoking, and some marijuana use. On examination, his vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 104/57 mm Hg, pulse of 56 bpm, and normal temperature. He had no significant findings on head, neck, cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal exam. He had no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. He had significant pitting edema on his feet and legs extending up to his knees as well as non‐pitting edema on the dorsum of both hands. Although there was edema, the skin was soft without any significant hardening and was without any overlying erythema. There were no signs of skin dimpling or grooves. His neurological examination revealed normal strength.

His initial laboratory work was significant for a mild eosinophilia of 700 with a normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. He had normal calcium, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. His alanine aminotransferase was slightly elevated and total protein slightly low, but he had normal albumin and bilirubin. His thyroid‐stimulating hormone was slightly increased, but his free T4 and total T3 were normal. His urinalysis was normal. He had a normal level of creatine phosphokinase, sedimentation rate, and C‐reactive protein. Further workup revealed a positive anti‐nuclear antibody with a titer of 1:160 with a speckled pattern. His extractable nuclear antigen panel was negative, including Scl‐70. His ANCA, myeloperoxidase and proteinase‐3 serum studies were also negative. His ACE level and complement levels were normal. Infectious workup revealed negative stool studies for culture, ova, and parasites. Antibodies for HIV, CMV, and Trichinella were negative. Serum for histoplasmosis, cryptosporidium, coccidiomycosis, and interferon gamma release assay were negative. A blood smear for parasites was negative. An ELISA IgG/IgM test for Lyme disease was positive with subsequent testing with Western blot strongly positive for IgG (eight out of ten bands positive) and also positive for IgM (two out of three bands positive).

522,1,29133,"Demographics of Abkhazia

This article is about the demographic features of the population of Abkhazia, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health, socioeconomic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The demographics of Abkhazia were very strongly affected by the 1992-1993 war with Georgia, which saw the expulsion and flight of over half of the republic's population, measuring 525,061 in the 1989 census. The ethnic composition of Abkhazia in past and current times plays a central role in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.

Size
The exact present size of Abkhazia's population is unclear. According to the census carried out in 2003 it measured 215,972 people, but this is contested by Georgian authorities. The Department of Statistics of Georgia estimated Abkhazia's population to be approximately 179,000 in 2003, and 178,000 in 2005 (the last year when such estimates were published in Georgia). 

Encyclopædia Britannica estimates the population in 2007 at 180,000 and the International Crisis Group estimates Abkhazia's total population in 2006 to be between 157,000 and 190,000 (or between 180,000 and 220,000 as estimated by United Nations Development Program in 1998).

The size of Abkhazia's population more than halved due to the 1992-1993 war – at the time of the 1989 census it had measured 525,061.

According to the last census in 2011 Abkhazia had 240,705 inhabitants.

Vital statistics

Ethnic composition

The population of Abkhazia remains ethnically very diverse, even after the 1992-1993 War. At present the population of Abkhazia is mainly made up of ethnic Abkhaz, Georgians (mostly Mingrelians), Hamshemin Armenians, and Russians. Prior to the war, ethnic Georgians made up 45.7% of Abkhazia's population, however, by 1993, most Georgians and some Russians and Armenians had fled Abkhazia or had been ethnically cleansed.

Historical developments
The earliest reliable records for Abkhazia are the Family Lists compiled in 1886, according to which the Sukhum Okrug (district of the Kutais Governorate of the Caucasus Viceroyalty of the Russian Empire) population was 68,773 of which 4,166 were Georgians (3,558 Mingrelians), 28,323 Abkhaz, 30,640 Samurzaq’anians, 2,149 Greeks, 1,090 Armenians, 1,090 Russians, 637 Estonians.

""It is in any case easy to see that, and why, the Samurzaq’anians are the bone of contention between Abkhaz and Georgians. According to the Family Lists, they were actually the most numerous group of all. Some (pro-)Abkhaz scholars have stated the percentage of Abkhaz in Abkhazia for 1886 to have been 85.7%; that clearly is an addition of Abkhaz plus Samurzaq’anoans (30,640 + 28,323 = 58,963 or 85.7% of 68,773). On the other hand, some (pro-)Georgian scholars have claimed that actually they, the 'Georgians', were in a majority of 50.6%, clearly arriving at this by adding all Kartvelians (Mingrelians [and some Laz for Sukhum town] + Georgians [including Imeretians and Gurians] to the Samurzaq’anoans (30,640 + 3,558 + 515 + 84 + 9 = 34,806 or 50.6% of 68,773). Presentation of figures should always be supported by explanation of how they are calculated. While the (pro-)Abkhaz may be criticized for the form they choose, they are quite justified in the essence: the very source itself compiles additional summary tables, and in these, Samurzaq’anoans are not listed, but the number of Abkhaz in Kutaisskaja Gubernija is given as 60,432. Now, in Batumi (city and okrug), 1,469 Abkhaz were listed; thus 58,963 remain - clearly, these are the Abkhaz plus the Samurzaq’anoans in our okrug! Besides the proof offered by the table, we have additional evidence in the fact that Samurzaq’anoans and Abkhaz are kept apart quite neatly. Only in two villages in Gumista, far from Samurzaq’an(o"

A radius of 800 m (an approximate 10 min walk from the school gate) was delineated as the study area around each school for the purpose of examining the food environment. We used a cut off distance of 800 m representing a 10 min walk rather than 400 m representing a 5 min walk based on statistical methods initially employed by Austin et al. in their characterisation of school neighbourhood food environments in the US \[[@CR21]\] and subsequently employed by Ellaway et al. in their analysis of food environments around socially disadvantaged schools in Glasgow \[[@CR22]\]. A cut off distance of 800 m was assessed as appropriate in this study as Scottish secondary school pupils are entitled to a 40 min school lunch break and so have ample time to reach food outlets within an 800 m radius, purchase food and return to school if they walk briskly. Pupil numbers for each school ranged from 600 pupils in the smallest school to 1300 pupils in the largest. FSM entitlement varied from 12.2% to 42.2%. Average FSM entitlement across the city at the time of the research was 30%, double that for Scottish secondary schools.

Donahue, 138 Colo. at 498, 335 P.2d at 288. In Donahue, we also noted that limitations in a PUC certificate on the passenger-carrying capacity of a taxicab company's vehicles were ""integral parts of the certificates of public convenience and necessity... imposed to prevent the holders thereof from competing with and rendering the scheduled operation of [a competitor] inefficient, if not impossible."" Id., 138 Colo. at 499, 335 P.2d at 288.
Yellow Cab's interest in protecting its competitive position also reflects its interest as a regulated carrier in continuing to serve the public efficiently and effectively. The ALJ determined that there was a significant public demand for transportation in large vehicles and that removal of the vehicle size limitations initially found necessary for the public convenience and necessity when 191 Corp. obtained its certificate of authority would result in that carrier's ability to transport significantly larger numbers of passengers more efficiently. Under this scenario Yellow Cab's profitability might well be adversely affected. Because such a negative economic impact could impair Yellow Cab's ability to serve the public efficiently and effectively under its own certificate, it was entitled as a regulated carrier to present evidence that its existing service was adequate and that expansion of 191 Corp.'s authority was not required by and would not serve the public convenience and necessity.

C
Our conclusion that Yellow Cab satisfied the statutory requirements for intervention in the proceeding to determine 191 Corp.'s request for different authority is supported by prior decisions of this court. In RAM Broadcasting, we recognized that ""standing to participate in a PUC proceeding, delineated by statute and rule, differs from standing to bring a lawsuit."" RAM Broadcasting, 702 P.2d at 749.

København was a Danish five-masted barque used as a naval training vessel until its disappearance after December 22, 1928. Built for the Danish East Asiatic Company in 1921, it was the world's largest sailing ship at the time, and primarily served for sail training of young cadets.

The København was last heard from on December 21, 1928 while en route from Buenos Aires to Australia. When it became clear the ship was missing, a lengthy search ensued, but neither København nor anyone who has been aboard her on her final voyage was ever seen or heard from again. Despite both the extensive search and much speculation about the vessel's fate, København remains missing and what happened to her crew and cadets remains a mystery.

Description
The København was built by the firm of Ramage & Ferguson at Leith in Scotland (number 256), begun in 1913 but not completed until March 24, 1921. It was constructed for the Danish East Asiatic Company as a sail training ship. Known as the ""Big Dane"", it was the largest sailing ship in the world when completed. It was 430 feet (131 metres) long and grossed 3,965 tons; its five masts stood nearly 20 stories high with sails spanning a total of 56,000 square feet (5,202 square metres). It had an auxiliary diesel motor as well as a wireless transmitter. The figurehead was a carving of a helmeted Bishop Absalon.

Primarily intended for training young cadets seeking an officer's license, the ship offset some of its costs by carrying limited amounts of cargo on its voyages. Baron Nils Juel-Brockdorff oversaw the ship's construction and subsequently served as its first captain. From 1921 to 1928 the ship made nine voyages, visiting nearly every continent and completing two circumnavigations.

Disappearance
On September 21, 1928, the København departed from Nørresundby in Northern Jutland for Buenos Aires on its tenth, and ultimately final, voyage. The captain was Hans Andersen; 75 persons were aboard, including 26 crew and 45 cadets. The goal was to unload a shipload of chalk and bagged cement in Buenos Aires, take on another load of cargo and sail for Melbourne, and then bring a shipment of Australian wheat back to Europe.

The København arrived at Buenos Aires on November 17, 1928, impressing the locals, in particular emigrant Danes. The cargo was unloaded; however, the departure was delayed as there were no paying commissions to take the cargo to Australia. Finally, on December 14, Captain Andersen decided to ship out to Australia without a cargo. The voyage was expected to take 45 days. On December 22 the København exchanged radio messages with the Norwegian steamer William Blumer, indicating they were about 900 miles from Tristan da Cunha and that ""all is well"". The Blumer attempted to contact the København again later that night, but received no response. The ship was never heard from again.

Search and legacy
Search and rescue efforts were not launched immediately after København dropped out of contact, due to the length of the voyage to Australia, and the fact that Andersen routinely went long periods without sending a message. After months without any sight of or word from København, concerns arose that something had gone wrong. In April 1929, four months after København was last seen and heard from, the Danish East Asiatic Company dispatched a motor vessel, the Mexico, to Tristan da Cunha. Residents reported having seen a large five-masted ship with its foremast broken on January 21, 1929; however, it had not attempted to land on the island. The Mexico, joined by the British Royal Navy, searched for the København for several months, but found no sign of it. The Danish government officially declared the ship and its crew were lost at sea.

A number of theories for the København'''s disappearance have been advanced. The most commonly accepted is that the ship struck an iceberg in the dark or fog. If"
531,0,24888,"Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most useful diagnostic studies for identification of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The classic teaching is ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is defined as symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) + new ST-segment elevation at the J point in at least 2 anatomically contiguous leads of at least 2mm (0.2mV) in men or at least 1.5mm in women in leads V2 – V3 and/or at least 1mm (0.1mV) in other contiguous leads or the limb leads, in the absence of a left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or other non-acute MI ST-segment elevation presentations. Unfortunately, the ECG may be non-diagnostic in nearly half of all patients who initially present with AMI. There are also STEMI equivalent patterns that are caused by occlusion of the coronary arteries that place a significant portion of the left ventricle at jeopardy and result in poor outcomes. This review article focused on 5 under recognized high-risk ECG patterns in the ACS patient that result in poor outcomes including malignant dysrhythmias, higher rates of cardiogenic shock, and death.

532,14,15572,"L and infectious brain lesions is difficult but clinically relevant, particularly in immunocompromised patients. In this setting, nonconventional MRI may be used to differentiate focal brain lesions in PCNSL from neurotoxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, tuberculosis and intracranial abscesses.[@bib0350] DWI with ADC maps is useful to distinguish between toxoplasmosis and PCNSL. Early toxoplasmosis may be associated with areas of restricted diffusion on DWI; however, toxoplasmosis lesions have significantly greater diffusion than in PCNSL. ADC ratios that ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 have been reported for both PCNSL and toxoplasmosis, whereas ADC ratios greater than 1.6 were associated solely with toxoplasmosis.[@bib0310] In addition, toxoplasmosis may be indicated by the presence of Lip and Lac and a decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio on MRS. Conversely, markedly elevated Cho levels would favor a PCNSL diagnosis.[@bib0265], [@bib0300] The accuracy of MRS is inversely proportional to the extension of necrosis ([Figure 3](#fig0015){ref-type=""fig""}).

The conventional and nonconventional MRI and pathological features of CNS post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) are similar to those of PCNSL and have been observed in immunocompromised patients.[@bib0355], [@bib0360], [@bib0365] An imaging pattern that is associated with CNS PTLD includes peripherally enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, which are usually multifocal supratentorial masses that may extend to the ependymal surface leptomeninges with nodular enhancement. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing disease, guiding biopsy and monitoring disease responses following therapy.[@bib0370]

After solid organ transplantation, patients are at risk of developing several neurological complications, including neurotoxicity due to immunosuppressive drugs, seizures, encephalopathy, stroke, opportunistic infections, and PTLD.[@bib0365] Because of immunosuppression, transplant patients are at risk for developing several CNS infections that may lead to meningitis, encephalitis, and focal abscesses. Several CNS infections share many overlapping imaging features with PTLD, particularly in the first months after transplantation. Nonconventional MRI helps the prompt diagnosis of disease, the guidance of biopsy and the initiation of appropriate treatment.

Peculiar presentations of primary central nervous system lymphomas {#sec0040}
==================================================================

Leptomeningeal infiltration in the course of lymphoma, particularly in systemic disease, is not rare. However, this imaging appearance is nonspecific and may alternatively occur after CNS invasion by infection or in several other primary and systemic malignancies (meningeal carcinomatosis). Associated periventricular masses, mainly with subependymal infiltration, may corroborate a diagnosis of CNS lymphoma in a differential diagnosis.[@bib0250] Dural-based lymphoma, particularly the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) subtype, mimics meningiomas; therefore, a careful interpretation of imaging findings in the clinical scenario is recommended.

535,18,15711,"Q:

The proper way of raising events in the.NET framework

Currently ""Avoid checking for null event handlers"" is at the top of the answers to the post titled Hidden Features of C# and it contains severely misleading information.
While I understand that Stack Overflow is a ""democracy"" and the answer rose to the top by virtue of public voting, I feel that a lot of people that up-voted the answer either did not have a complete understanding of C#/.NET or did not take the time to fully understand the consequences of the practice described in the post.
In short the post is advocating the use of the following construct to avoid having to check for null when invoking the event.
public event EventHandler SomeEvent = delegate {};
// Later..
void DoSomething()
{
   // Invoke SomeEvent without having to check for null reference
    SomeEvent(this, EventArgs.Empty);  
}

At a first glance this may seem like a clever shortcut but it can be the cause for some serious headaches in a large application, especially if concurrency is involved.
Before calling the delegate of an event you have to check for a null reference. Just because you have initialized the event with an empty delegate does not mean that a user of your class won't set it to null at some point and break your code.
Something like this is typical:
void DoSomething()
{
    if(SomeEvent!= null) 
        SomeEvent(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}

But even in the above example the possibility exists that while DoSomething() may be run by a thread, another could remove the event handlers, and a race condition could"

537,3,28728," to physical possession of the policy, we leave open all questions as to the rights of the parties in regard to the insurance contract which it evidences."" (p. 183 of 225 Md.). Those questions were not, and could not have been presented in that case, but are at issue here, and hence it is obvious that the decision in Durst is not res judicata as to those matters. Cf. Surrey Inn, Inc. v. Jennings, 215 Md. 446, 453-454, 138 A.2d 658 (1958).
We think it appropriate at this point to note that among the defenses raised below in this case by the former wife were a claim that her husband had made a gift of the policy to her immediately after he took it out, and a claim that the policy belonged to her because she paid the one premium in 1950 to prevent a lapse of the policy. However, the Chancellor decided the case below on the basis of a finding that Mrs. Durst had *315 wrongfully converted the policy in 1953, thus repudiating any theory of ownership of the policy by her prior to that time. Moreover, the same claims were considered in Durst v. Durst and are now foreclosed by the holding in that case that Mrs. Durst's right to possession of the policy rested upon her conversion of it in 1953.
We now proceed to the basic issues raised by this appeal. The appellant contends that the Chancellor was in error in holding that Mrs. Durst's conversion of the policy, coupled with the husband's failure to sue for its recovery for six years thereafter, ""gave the wife title to the policy and a vested interest in it"", and that the husband had been guilty of laches, so that he is now precluded from changing the beneficiaries named in the policy. On the contrary, the appellant maintains that his former wife has acquired no vested interest in the underlying insurance contract, as distinguished from the ""paper writing"" which evidences it, that laches is inapplicable, and that the insurance company may be compelled to change the beneficiaries without presentation of the original policy to it.
We have uniformly held that where the right by the insured to change the beneficiary named in a life insurance policy is reserved, the beneficiary has no vested or indefeasible interest under the policy during the lifetime of the insured, but only a revocable expectancy contingent upon being the beneficiary at the time of the insured's death, and that notice to, or the consent of, the beneficiary is unnecessary in order to effectuate a valid change of beneficiary. Chapman v. Prudential Ins. Co., 215 Md. 87, 136 A.2d 752 (1957), and authorities cited. A beneficiary named in a life insurance policy has no such interest therein as entitles her to control a change in beneficiaries, or other dealings with the policy, during the lifetime of the owner of the policy.

539,6,29887," the courts of the *539 District of Columbia. Act of September 14, 1922, c. 306, § 5, 42 Stat. 837, 839. At that time, however, before the O'Donoghue decision, there seems to have been a consensus that the courts of the District were not confined or protected by Article III; as late as 1930, this Court regarded it as ""recognized that the courts of the District of Columbia are not created under the judiciary article of the Constitution but are legislative courts...."" Federal Radio Comm'n v. General Electric Co., 281 U. S. 464, 468; and see Katz, Federal Legislative Courts, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 894, 899-903 (1930). The 1922 Act cannot therefore be viewed ex proprio vigore as conferring Article III status on judges subsequently appointed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.[9]
A more novel suggestion is that the assignment statute itself, 28 U. S. C. §§ 291-296, authorized the Chief Justice to appoint inferior Article III judges in the course of designating them for service on Article III courts.[10] See Shartel, Federal JudgesAppointment, Supervision, and RemovalSome Possibilities under the Constitution, 28 Mich. L. Rev. 485 (1930); cf. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 397-398; Rice v. Ames, 180 U. S. 371, 378. But we need not consider the constitutional questions involved in this suggestion, for the statute does not readily lend itself *540 to such a construction. If nothing else, the authority given the Chief Justice in 28 U. S. C. § 295 to revoke assignments previously made is wholly inconsistent with a reading of the statute as empowering him to appoint inferior Article III judges. Judges assigned by the Chief Justice who are not previously endowed with constitutional security of tenure and compensation thus can gain nothing by the designation.[11]
It is significant that Congress did not enact the present broad assignment statute until after it had declared the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to be constitutional courts. Act of August 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 848. A major purpose of these declarations was to eliminate uncertainty whether regular Article III judges might be assigned to assist in the business of those courts when disability or disqualification made it difficult for them to obtain a quorum.[12] Those doubts, suggested by dicta in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 460, would be expanded rather than allayed were we to hold that the judges of the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals enjoy the protections of Article III while leaving at large the status of those courts. For these various reasons, the constitutional quality of tenure and compensation extended *541 Judges Madden and Jackson at the time of their confirmation must be deemed to have depended upon the constitutional status of the courts to which they were primarily appointed.

546,10,12404," “by the time they sit down to eat their twenty-first birthday cake, about one-sixth of the nation’s youth are wearing full or partial dentures”; by the age of 45, that figure rose to two-thirds. At least until the birth of the NHS, says Bairsto, most people would only go to the dentist when they were in pain. The growth in understanding of how oral bacteria form plaque and how the various species of those bacteria are linked to gingivitis and cavities has led to a vast improvement, through new products such as fluoridated toothpaste, improvements in brushing technique, and better dentistry. “It’s staggering how much our oral health has improved,” says Bairsto. “In a relatively short space of time.”

Research into electric toothbrushes, however, was scarcer. That 1969 Which? article mentions a two-year study published by the University of Dundee dental school in 1968, which found no advantage for electric toothbrushes over manual ones, although Which? did add that children found them more fun and disabled people found them easier, so they might improve brushing habits in those groups.

In the years after that, research did pick up. The trouble is that, unlike the Dundee study, most of the research has been carried out by pharmaceutical companies who themselves make electric toothbrushes. There’s nothing insidious about this: the companies would do the research themselves, or they would offer money to university departments or individual scholars to support research, which is entirely above board. One of the authors quoted in this piece was punctilious in declaring an interest, by saying that he did one piece of research a few years ago which was funded by a major toothbrush manufacturer. But there is good evidence that studies with financial conflicts of interest are more likely to return positive results.

Read next China has almost eliminated Covid-19. What can the world learn? China has almost eliminated Covid-19. What can the world learn?

However, that doesn’t mean there is no good research. Peter Robinson, head of the School of Oral and Dental Sciences at the University of Bristol, worked – along with many other scientists – on some major reviews of the scientific literature by the respected Cochrane Library. “I got involved about 20 years ago,” he says. The first was in 2003; the latest was 2014.

The reviews looked at the benefits of “powered vs manual toothbrushing for oral health”. (They call them powered toothbrushes, rather than electric toothbrushes as the rest of us do. “We call them powered,” says Robinson, wearily, “because we do.”)

The Cochrane reviews took all of the available research on the topic, tried to tease out the good, unbiased studies, and combined them to make, in essence, one large, extra-powerful super-study, a “meta-analysis”. Damian Walmsley, a professor at the University of Birmingham’s School of Dentistry who also worked on the reviews, says they took steps to avoid most of the obvious pitfalls of biased science. For instance, negative studies might simply not be published – the so-called “desk drawer” problem, or publication bias, meaning that the scientific literature tends to fill up with positive results. Walmsley says Cochrane relies on studies that were registered in advance, so they know they aren’t being hidden. They also go and ask for stuff that didn’t make it to publication, the “grey data”. “Say if there was an abstract at a conference but the paper never materialised,” says Walmsley. “We’d write to the companies and ask for the data, and most of them obliged.” Three such unpublished studies are quoted in the review.

It’s impossible to entirely eliminate bias, and Sue Pavitt, a professor of dental public health at the University of Leeds, points out that of the 56 trials looked at in the latest Cochrane, only five were declared at “low” risk of bias. (Five were discounted because of their “high” risk, and the other 46 were “unclear”.) What’s more, they’re small: “There were 4,624 partipants in those 51. If you divide 4,624 by 51, you see that the average size is small on the whole.” Along with the potential for bias, she says, “that sets up some concerns”.

The US is a great place to invest - just ask the Chinese.

Chinese investors have been putting their money in US companies, US real estate and recently US dating.

They aren't the only ones. In 2015 the US reclaimed its position as the top stop for foreign investors, knocking China back down to second place.

But the growing presence of Chinese investors in big US brands has fuelled some fears that China is taking over the US economy.

So could you spend a day in the US using only Chinese goods? The answer it turns out is yes... if you try.

To test this idea, I set some ground rules: the product must be made in China or majority owned by a Chinese company/investor.

Clothes

To start my day off on the right foot I decided to wear clothes that were made in China.

This proved to be more difficult than I expected. A lot of my clothes were made in Vietnam - something likely to increase if the Trans-Pacific Partnership kicks in. The deal would allow goods from Vietnam and other countries on the Pacific, but not China, to be imported to the US tariff-free.

Breakfast

Coming up with a Chinese breakfast was pretty easy without turning to dumplings or noodles. Bacon!

Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork producer, was purchased by China's Shuanghui International in 2014 in the largest Chinese takeover of a US company to date.

Shuanghui paid $4.7bn (£3.3bn) for the Virginia-based company.

Americans struggled to cope with the idea that their ham, bacon and sausage would have a Chinese owner. The deal faced regulatory challenges and questions about food safety from Congress, but eventually went through allowing me to make ""Chinese"" breakfast right in my own kitchen.

Technology

There are a few very obvious pieces of Chinese gear in my apartment, namely my iPhone and iPad.

Apple has come under scrutiny in recent years for the scale of its manufacturing in China and the conditions faced by workers.

A 2012 study by Syracuse University pointed out that most of the iPhone is developed in the US. The research, software development, patenting and marketing are for the most part based in the United States, meaning that's where the bulk of the profits return.

Advice on the best way to find intersection of two dictionaries

I have posted a similar question before, but after reworking the project, I've gotten here:
With two csv files (new.csv, scrapers.csv) - 
new.csv contains a single column:
'urls' = whole URLs

scrapers.csv contains two columns:
'scraper_dom' = A simplification of specific URL domains
'scraper_id' = An associated scraper_id that is used to import URLs to a separately managed database 

Question
My goal here is to iterate through new.csv (parsing out fnetloc using urlparse) and perform a lookup on scrapers.csv to return a set of matching'scraper_id' given a set of 'urls' (the way a VLOOKUP would work, or a JOIN in SQL), once urlparse does it's thing to isolate the netloc within the URL (the result of fnetloc).
My next big issue is that urlparse does not parse the URLs (from new.csv) to the exact simplification found in the scrapers.csv file, so I'd be reliant on a sort of partial match until I can figure out the regular expressions to use for that part of it.
I've imported pandas because previous attempts found me creating DataFrames and performing a pd.merge but I couldn't get that to work either...

How to raise a subscript?

For some reason, I need to write a “minus” sign as a subscript on some symbols, but if I simply write $\Pi_{-}$ the result looks kind of odd. I've found that $\Pi{\scriptstyle -}$ looks reasonably better. But if want to add this “minus” subscript and a prime, then I get an unwanted space between the prime and the fake subscript.

So, is there a way to simply raise the subscript a bit?
Note: I've considered writing something like $\Pi\mathrlap{'}{\scriptstyle -}$, which actually produces something like I want. But then it is difficult to define a macro such that I can write \Neg{\Pi} and \Neg{\Pi'} to add the “subscript minus” on the symbol I supply as an argument.

A:

You can put {\raisebox{2pt}{$\scriptstyle-$}} in the subscript. You may need to play with \mathchoice if you want a solution that will work in subsubscripts as well.
Edit: Or better yet, \mathpalette:
\makeatletter
\newcommand{\raisemath}[1]{\mathpalette{\raisem@th{#1}}}
\newcommand{\raisem@th}[3]{\raisebox{#1}{$#2#3$}}
\makeatother

and use $\Pi_{\raisemath{2pt}{-}}$."

FALSE

Example: [Collected via e-mail, October 2013]



Hi everyone, I’ve got a odd but very important question about these various mailbox stickers I see on not only my mailbox but on the mailboxes of people in my neighborhood and perhaps almost everywhere. Hi everyone, I’ve got a odd but very important question about these various mailbox stickers I see on not only my mailbox but on the mailboxes of people in my neighborhood and perhaps almost everywhere. They are all round stickers, they are usually either as big as half dollar coins, or as small as nickels or pennies. They are either made out of a thin reflective plastic or the smaller ones I’ve seen are just plain paper. Now one of the odd and scary things I have heard about these stickers is that they have been placed there by people in working in secret for not just the government but for a up coming one world government. And that the color of the stickers refer to the fate of each person when either the one world government or martial law gets established in our country. The red indicates that they will come after you and kill you immediately, the blue means they will take you to a concentration camp or a “FEMA camp” and torture you until you either obey or die. Yellow means that they think you will mostly follow them or be no threat to them and they will just let you starve to death. Where as pink means you are totally in obedience to them and will basically be their mind slave. Now I personally am wondering if there is any truth to this.



Origins: A common form of rumor holds that homes are being marked in some subtle way — through the use of anything from cable ties to chalk marks to colored stickers to ribbons, placed on curbs, sidewalks, mailboxes, lampposts, or trees — by groups intent on targeting the residents for nefarious purposes — anyone from burglars to dog thieves to government agents — who will be returning later to implement their plans of stealing from (or otherwise harming) the people who live in those homes. In nearly every case such rumors prove to be false: the markings in question typically turn out to be innocuous indicators left behind by legitimate groups working in the area (such as road crews,

utility companies, or surveyors), and the rumors are started by suspicious residents unfamiliar with the purpose of the markings who immediately leap to the unfounded conclusion that they must have some connection to recent (but purely coincidental) criminal activity in the neighborhood.

All such rumors generally fail in their very premise. Targeting homes for illicit purposes by marking them with some exterior symbol is unnecessarily inefficient: it requires time and effort to visit homes and mark them, it risks exposure from onlookers who might notice and call attention to the activity and discover its purpose, and the markings are too easily removed (accidentally or purposely) by residents or eradicated by weather, or overlooked by those supposed to be finding them afterwards. Yet all of these vagaries can be easily avoided in one simple way: just jotting down the addresses of the homes of interest. There’s no good reason for bad guys to mark a home with some form of symbol as a method for being able to find and return to it later when they could more easily and safely accomplish the same thing simply by recording its address.

The marking of homes to identify them as targets for future activity makes sense only if the markings and the follow-up activity are being performed by different groups who are prevented by time and distance from communicating with each other between those two steps. But in today’s"

It should come as no surprise that Transaero's new base at Moscow Vnukovo Airport – which opened just last year – has already given rise to a strategic partnership with the gateway's other home carrier, UTair Aviation. The second and third largest airlines in Russia make a good strategic fit. Transaero's predominantly widebody fleet focusses on long-haul destinations overseas and in the Russian Far East, while UTair's majority narrowbody metal is mainly put to work in the country's vast territories and eastern Europe.

But for Transaero chief executive Olga Pleshakova, who has been at the helm since 2001, there is much work to be done before the true potential of Russia's aviation market can be unlocked...

Few airlines around the world can claim to have as diverse a fleet and range of operations as UTair Aviation. Even setting aside its numerous rotorcraft divisions – which deploy more than 350 helicopters from bases as far afield as Siberia, South Africa and India – the carrier's fixed-wing businesses encompass a dizzying array of aircraft, comprising Boeing, Airbus, ATR, Bombardier, Tupolev, Antonov, Yakovlev, LET and Gulfstream types.

Alongside the mainline UTair Aviation fleet, the group's operations centre on regional divisions UTair Express and Katekavia; freight specialist UTair Cargo; and UTair Ukraine. Fleet homogeneity will never be a goal for the airline – its subsidiaries contend with a multitude of different airports, climates and operating environments – but chief financial officer Igor Petrov insists that work is under way to streamline the fleet...

The opening of Mocow Vnukovo Airport's Terminal A in December 2012 was the latest, and perhaps most significant milestone in the gateway's 2015 Master Plan. The new domestic and international terminal has total floor space of 270,000 sq m, comprising 52 boarding gates and 31 contact stands. Three of the jetways are configured for the Boeing 747 – favoured by home carrier Transaero – including one which can also handle the Airbus A380.

Together with Terminal B, which caters for international charter and low-cost flights, the Vnukovo-1 mainline terminal cluster has a total capacity of 15 million passengers per year. That is comfortably above the 9.7 million customers it served in 2012, but Vnukovo chairman Vitaly Vantsev says further expansion is on the horizon. ""Over the next five to ten years, we expect to have throughput capacity of about 20 million passengers per year,"" he predicts....

The largest airline in Russia by every metric, Aeroflot has the most to gain or lose from changing fortunes in the country's aviation industry. The flag carrier has consciously put itself at the forefront of all sectors – acquiring regional subsidiaries, planning a low-cost offshoot, and championing Russian-made aircraft. It is a strategy that could pay off handsomely, but also exposes the state-owned airline to heavy downside risk.

The decision to acquire controlling stakes in six regional operators in 2010 – Rossiya, Orenair, Kavminvodyavia, Saravia, Vladivostok Avia and SAT Airlines – brought Aeroflot's domestic market share above 33%. Kavminvodyavia"

568,10,7986,"Grandmother-of-three faces up to her hair loss in an unusual way... by getting her entire HEAD covered in a £700 tattoo



A grandmother left completely bald by alopecia has ditched her wig in favour of something a little more permanent - a tattoo covering her entire head.

Ann McDonald, 60, suffers from alopecia and also has a thyroid problem which resulted in all of her hair falling out three years ago.

The grandmother-of-three was inspired to get the overlapping floral design which cost a £720 after becoming fed up with having to wear wigs and hats.

'It really really hurt': Ann McDonald had the floral pattern tattoo to cover her entire head after loosing her hair a few years ago

Ann (left aged 35) lost her hair to alopecia and a thyroid problem, used to have a full head of dark locks, says she didn't like being bald and so took the unusual decision to tattoo her entire scalp

The vast tattoo took 12 painstaking hours to complete but Ann said it has changed her life and she is happier than she has ever been.

Ann, from Edinburgh, said: ‘I was getting more and more depressed because I didn’t have any hair. I felt so ugly with a bald head and sometimes I would just lie in bed and cry.'

‘I didn’t want to be bald any more, I wanted something to cover my head. I’ve got hundreds of wigs and hats to hide it but they’re no good. So I decided to get a tattoo.

‘I’d been thinking about getting the tattoo for a wee while, but I got the idea to do my head when I was browsing on the internet one day.

‘I came across a picture of a woman who had a full head tattoo and I realised that’s what I wanted.’

Head covering: Ann decided to get the tattoo after becoming fed up with having to wear wigs and hats

Ann, a cleaner, then copied photographs and took them to local tattoo studios, but she was turned away three times.

She said: ‘I went to a few places but they didn’t want to do it. One place said it might be dangerous and the others just said no and passed on it.’

A labour of love: The overlapping floral design which cost £720, took over 12 hours and 3 hour sessions to complete

Having been turned away from other tattoo parlous Ann went to Pete's Tattoo Studio in Dalkeith, where owner Pete Gillespie and his son Kevan agreed to do the piece

Undeterred, she finally got her wish when she visited Pete’s Tattoo Studio in Dalkeith, where owner Pete Gillespie and his son Kevan agreed to do the piece.

It took four gruelling three-hour sessions to complete the floral, spiral shading with a black background and curls to represent hair and cost £720.

Ann, who had the full support of her husband Ian, 68, and her five children, said she is delighted with the result but admitted it was very painful.

WHEN the young Pauline Johnson stood in the hallway of Chiefswood, the family home on the Grand River, on a summer's afternoon, she had the happy certainty that she was in the centre of her own small universe. All around her flowed the sounds of the busy Johnson household. From the study on her left seeped the growl of discussion as her father, George Johnson, held court with various neighbours. From the drawing room on her right came the _plink_ of awkward chords as her older brother Beverly picked out the latest dance tune on the Heintzman piano. Breathy chatter flowed from the parlour, where her sister Eva helped the maid set out the silver tea service. Allen, the brother closest in age to Pauline, was probably in the kitchen garden, gorging himself on the last raspberries of the season. If Pauline glanced up the elegant staircase, she could see her mother, Emily Johnson, carefully adjusting her tea gown before she descended to the"
576,9,13785,"The Prelature of Ipil is one of the ecclesiastical territories in the province of Zamboanga del Sur. It occupies an area of 4,850
square kilometers extending from the boundary of Zamboanga del Norte on the north to Olutanga Island on the south, from the town of Tungawan on the west to the town Margosatubig on the east boundaries set by Pope John
Paul II himself when he decreed the separation of this ecclesiastical territory from the Archdiocese of Zamboanga on December 24, 1979.

The area described above comprises three-fifths of the province of Zamboanga del
Sur. The terrain is generally hilly bounded by mountains on the north and the Sibuyan Bay on the south. There are no large cities in the area – it is predominantly rural, predominantly agricultural, with
rice, corn, rubber and coconut as the major crops. Of these only rubber is produced commercially. The overall economic situation of the area is very poor. Roads and facilities are inadequate.

The
population covered by the prelature is 581,316 of which 62 per cent are Catholics. A majority of the population are migrants from the Central Visayas area, which accounts for the predominance of the Cebuano
dialect, followed by Ilonggo. These are the dialects used in the Catholic liturgy.

The Prelature of Ipil is a suffrafan of the Archdiocese of Zamboanga with whom it shamres much of its history of
evangelization. The faith was first brought to the Zamboangas by the Jesuit Missionaries as early as 1635. The Jesuit father took charge for many years over what was then considered mission territory.
Two Jesuit priests – Father Francisco Paliola and Father Alejandro Lopez lost their lives as martyrs in their efforts to win over the Muslim through diplomacy.

From 1910 the whole Island of Mindanao fell under the
jurisdiction of the Diocese of Zamboanga. In 1933, other ecclesiastical territories were established in Mindanao, separating themselves from Zamboanga, the last of which was the Prelature of Ipil in 1979.

Politically the two Zamboangas were just one province since the days of the Spanish era. Because of the many waves of migrations from the northern islands that occurred during the American era, the large province
of Zamboanga was split up into two provinces in 1952.

On June 21, 1980, Bishop Federico O. Escaler, SJ, was transferred from Kidapawan to Ipil. At that time there were only 9 parishes with 13 priests, all
Jesuits. In 1981 Bishop Escaler invited new groups to come and work in the prelature. And they came: the Spinola Sisters and the PIME Fathers. In 1981 the parish church of Ipil became a cathedral.

The years 1984 and 1985 were peak years of militarization and frequent encounters between the military and the rebels – members of the New People's Army (NPA"

Let’s consider these questions…
Should the poor be blamed for their poverty?
Should the government or citizens be responsible for the cost of health care?
Shall we expect only developed countries to deal with climate change?

Before you start searching for your own answers, the media, believe it or not, have already planted theirs in your mind.

News media set the public agenda every day by telling us what is important to know and how to think about it. When it comes to global challenges such as poverty, climate change, and the refugee crisis, the media often play a decisive role in defining both the problem and responsibility. Attribution of responsibility in media reporting should not be underestimated, as it suggests the source of problems and who should fix them, shapes the public discourse and opinions about issues, and subsequently influences local and global policy approaches to public concerns.

Talking about poverty

In Talking about Poverty, University of South Carolina professor Sei-Hill Kim and his colleagues discuss how printed and broadcast media presented both causes of and solutions to poverty in America. They analyzed news stories from newspapers in the four wealthiest and poorest states in the U.S., as well as TV news stories from ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN between 1993 and 2007. They found that the news media tend to attribute poverty to social causes (e.g., bad economy, ineffective government, lack of support for education, etc.) more than personal factors (e.g., lack of education, broken families, high risk personal choices, etc.). To reduce poverty, the media also more frequently prioritizes societal-level solutions over personal-level solutions.

Overall, the American media blame poverty on social forces more than personal factors. However, as compared to more politically conservative news media, liberal media outlets were even more likely to attribute poverty to social factors such as the current economic policies, minimum wage, and government aid than the poor themselves.

This suggests that the American media generally tend toward framing poverty as a problem that requires social interventions, most likely leading the public to demand action from the government and social institutions. The type of media one consumes also determines his/her level of expectation regarding systematic, institutional efforts to tackle poverty.

If the media in the U.S. frame poverty in a relatively consistent way, how does attribution of responsibility play out in international news regarding a global issue that involves the interest of multiple players?

When Elizabeth Manley entered the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, few analysts thought she had a chance at medalling in front of the home crowd. Expectations were that a finish anywhere near the podium would be considered a success for the figure skater from Trenton, Ont.

Despite a string of high placements in national championships, the blond-bobbed skater had limited success in international competition early in her career, putting up her best performance at the 1982 World Figure Skating Championships with a 13th-place finish.

After recovering from a bout of homesickness that briefly saw her quit the sport, and failing to medal at the 1984 Sarajevo Games, Manley entered Calgary as an underdog, somewhat shaded from the spotlight by a high-profile rivalry between the German and American favourites. The rest is Canadian history.

Manley surprised the home crowd at the Olympic Saddledome, and the thousands more Canadians watching at home, with a brilliant freestyle performance that included five triple jumps, and captured the silver medal. The perky sensation’s success would become a definitive moment in Canadian Olympic history and earn her the title of Canada’s Sweetheart.

[**We report on results from the Durham/UKST Galaxy Redshift Survey where we have found large scale “cellular” features in the galaxy distribution. These have spatial 2-point correlation function power significantly in excess of the predictions of the standard cold dark matter cosmological model$^{1}$, supporting the previous observational results from the APM survey$^{\bf 2,3}$. At smaller scales, the 1-D pairwise galaxy velocity dispersion is measured to be $\bf 387^{+96}_{-62}$ kms$^{-1}$ which is also inconsistent with the prediction of the standard cold dark matter model$^{1}$. Finally, the survey has produced the most significant detection yet of large scale redshift space distortions due to dynamical infall of galaxies$^{4}$. An estimate of $\bf \Omega^{0.6}/b = 0.55 \pm 0.12$ is obtained which is consistent either with a low density Universe or a critical density Universe where galaxies are biased tracers of the mass.**]{}

The principal aims of the Durham/UKST Galaxy Redshift Survey are to investigate the structure and dynamics of the Universe on scales 1-100$h^{-1}$Mpc (where $h$ is Hubble’s constant in units of 100 kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$). The survey was constructed by measuring the redshifts for 1 in 3 of the galaxies from the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy Catalogue$^{5}$ (EDSGC) to $b_{J} \simeq 17^{m}$. The resulting survey contains $\sim 2500$ redshifts, covers a $\sim 20^{\circ} \times
75^{\circ}$ contiguous area of the sky at the South Galactic Pole and probes to a depth of $> 300h^{-1}$Mpc with a median depth of $\sim
150h^{-1}$Mpc. The total volume of space surveyed is $\sim 4 \times
10^{6}h^{-3}$Mpc$^{3}$, approximately six times that of the updated Southern Sky Redshift Survey$^{6}$, due to our $\sim 2.5^{m}$ fainter limit.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the galaxies in right ascension and velocity for each of four, $5^{\circ}$, declination slices. The survey gives the striking impression that the galaxy distribution is “cellular” or “bubble-like” on 50-100$h^{-1}$Mpc scales. The most noticeable structure is the low density region lying between 0 and 90$h^{-1}$Mpc surrounded by long “walls” of galaxies. This structure is present in the slices at $-30^{\circ}$, $-35^{\circ}$ and $-40^{\circ}$ and was referred to as the Sculptor Void in earlier, shallower surveys$^{7,8}$. In the most northerly slice at $-25^{\circ}$ there is evidence that we are"

“So you’ve come to walk through the wake, eh?” one Democratic House staffer quipped shortly after I walked into Molly Malone’s, an Irish pub near Capitol Hill. On Monday, the bar was thronged with soon-to-be-out-of-work staffers for the 60-odd Democratic House members wiped out in the midterms. They’d come together to commiserate, share job-seeking advice—and drown their collective sorrows in more than a few drinks.

Nearly all of the young, soon-departing staffers I spoke to had spent their entire professional lives working on Democratic campaigns or on the Hill. Many were bracing for an indeterminably long walk through the political wilderness. Their coping strategies fell into roughly three categories: venting, rationalizing away the Democrats’ losses, and survivalist-minded resignation.

Riccardo Borgogno, La valle degli eretici, Edizioni Tabor, Valsusa luglio 2019, pp. 336, euro 12

“Il priore del convento, il balivo del Castrum, i catari, i templari, il fantasma del castello, l’uomo selvatico, il sabba delle streghe…che storia!”

Basterebbero già queste poche parole, dette da uno dei personaggi secondari del romanzo, per riassumere alcuni dei temi trattati nel testo di Riccardo Borgogno appena pubblicato dalle dizioni Tabor della Valsusa. Ma per averne un’immagine più esatta e completa occorrerebbe aggiungerne altre: culto di Diana, formaggi, Savoia, Escartoun, Poveri di Lione, complotti e, soprattutto, Movimento No Tav.

Le edizioni Tabor, da sempre impegnate nella pubblicazione di testi e saggi riguardanti le culture e le resistenze montane non solo valsusine, esordiscono nella letteratura con un romanzo “popolare” in cui storia e tradizioni valligiane si mescolano con il presente e i suoi dilemmi. Sociali, culturali e politici. Un incrocio di percorsi, narrazioni (soggettive e corali), memorie e cronache antiche e moderne che il titolo riassume perfettamente.

Come l’autore fa ancora dire ad un altro personaggio, una libraia di Bussoleno:

Gli abitanti di questa valle hanno una lunghissima tradizione di autogoverno, fin dall’epoca dei primi insediamenti umani. Siamo gente orgogliosa, solidale e laboriosa. Contrari al progresso, come i sostenitori dell’Alta Velocità ci accusano di essere? Se ti guardi intorno noterai che abbiamo automobili, televisori, computer e cellulari, come tutti. Non è questo il punto. Il punto è che, da sempre, la gente di questa valle fa quadrato contro chi arriva e vuole imporsi. E non è neppure questione di un atteggiamento di chiusura che sarebbe tipico delle genti di montagna, come spesso si sente affermare da chi in realtà non conosce né queste genti né la montagna. Da queste parti, infatti, siamo accoglienti con il forestiero, ma non con chi viene qui per comandare. E’ successo prima con i Romani, poi con Re e Imperatori, ora con l’Alta Vel"

592,0,12812,"Fright (film)

Fright is a 1971 British thriller film starring Susan George, Ian Bannen, Honor Blackman, and John Gregson. The film follows a babysitter who is terrorized one evening by her employer's deranged ex-husband. Its original working titles were The Baby Minder and Girl in the Dark before it was titled Fright.

Plot
College student Amanda is babysitting for Helen and Dr. Cordell, watching after their young son at their large estate in the woods. When she arrives, the child, Tara, is already asleep; Helen and Dr. Cordell leave, Amanda makes tea in the kitchen, and is watched by a man through the window. After hearing odd noises, she is startled by the doorbell ringing, and finds her boyfriend Chris at the door. The two lounge on the couch before she makes him leave after Helen calls the home to check in. As Chris walks outside, he is attacked by a man hiding outside who clobbers him on the head. 

Amanda continues to hear knocking noises and believes it is Chris playing a prank on her. She opens a window to reveal a silhouetted face staring back at her. Panicked, Amanda calls the restaurant where Helen is dining with her boyfriend Jim and their friend, Dr. Cordell. Helen is notified by the restaurant staff and goes to take the call, but the line goes dead after she picks up. Worried that her ex-husband, Brian, may have arrived at the home, Helen has Jim call the local psychiatric institute, who notify him that Brian escaped earlier in the night; Helen reveals in conversation that he had been institutionalized after he attempted to murder her; Dr. Cordell is his doctor.

At the front door, Amanda finds Chris, covered in blood; with him is Brian, who claims to be a neighbor who heard a commotion outside. Chris loses consciousness on the floor, and Brian consoles Amanda, who is distraught. At the house, Amanda grows disconcerted when Brian refuses to allow her upstairs, and begins calling her Helen. Realizing that he is Helen's ex-husband, Amanda begins to play into Brian's delusions, and repeatedly proclaims her love for him. 

Brian eventually falls asleep, and Amanda attempts to leave the house with Tara, but is stopped by him in the foyer. Chris regains consciousness and attempts to fight Brian, but Brian murders him. Amanda flees out the front door just as police arrive at the home, but she is pulled back inside by Brian, who threatens her and Tara with a shard of glass. Helen and Jim arrive at the home, where Dr. Cordell and numerous policemen have gathered. A standoff ensues in which they attempt to coax him out of the house. Brian demands Helen come inside, but she agrees only on the condition that Amanda and Tara are let outside. 

Helen enters the home, where Brian locks her inside, and begins choking her after he finds she has brought in a canister of tear gas. Amanda stops him by slashing his face open with the glass shard, and flees outside. Brian charges after her, carrying Tara with a piece of glass against his neck. The police hold fire and Helen follows outside and attempts to negotiate with him. Brian hands Tara to her and she slowly backs away from him. As she does so, Amanda avenges Chris by shooting Brian in the head, killing him.

PER CURIAM:

              Roger       Dean    Poindexter     seeks   to    appeal   the    district

court’s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2000)

petition.     The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or

judge     issues      a     certificate     of     appealability.         28     U.S.C.

§ 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue

absent “a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional

right.”    28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (2000).                A prisoner satisfies this

standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that

any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court

is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by

the district court is likewise debatable.                     Miller-El v. Cockrell,

597,9,8912,"I attended my first City of Oakland public meeting Monday, February 6th, to hear appeals by proprietors and regulars of The Kingfish Pub and Cafe seeking Landmark status before the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board.

Here’s the agenda, and this piece in Oakland North covers the meeting fairly well.

In what can only be described as rare for an Oakland story about a dive, The San Francisco Chronicle actually did a cover piece on the place and this attempt to achieve Landmark status back in October (Which was amended by a piece on C-1 of The Chron, by same author, February 12).

This discussion yields an opportunity to address local art, architecture and gentrification, and historical and archival significance of the culture of North Oakland.

We are a decade deep into the digital generation and there are new, complicated reasons to carefully consider how we archive the past. Things have long begun to look more the same and with less character. Huge mega stores and strip malls replace local businesses, and much of what has existed has been erased and destroyed casually because of a lack of concern for the vernacular value of place.

The Landmarks Board has little power in the face of the Planning Commission or the City Council, which are dominated by lobbyists, mostly for vested developers’ interests, but the Landmarks Board exists for a reason and it is imperative we sharply define exactly how much power regular people have to protest rampant development solely for personal profit.

There are serious questions as to whether our City government is sophisticated enough to appreciate and protect what constitutes a Landmark in a specific neighborhood. Though, in fairness, this cannot be said of Valerie Garry, Vice-Chair of the Landmarks Board, who is a preservationist and showed architectural, artistic and cultural sensitivity to the petitioners’ request.

The Board as a whole heard the petitioners, were thoughtful faced by so many in the gallery, and yielded time for public comment, asking relevant questions.

Board Members Daniel Schulman and John Goines III were particularly vocal, and both voted against the upgrade of the validation request. Indeed both seemed moved, but cynical.

Goines was like a reluctant father trying to help supporters of the pub to get over losing it. Schulman declared he had been to the pub over the years, and recently as well, but argued huffily that a stronger case could be made for The White Horse in the neighborhood – the voice of political reason breaking the hearts of pub regulars. This led to a discussion about the matter and many great, old Oakland bars were brought up.

Staff reminded Schulman that The White Horse, Geo Kayes and others mentioned are storefronts in a building of another purpose, and not a free-standing, crazy-gorgeous, little wooden building built over decades.

It was inarguable that The Kingfish was in the company of all of the very old bars the Board discussed, but that among them all, the Kingfish, as a structure, is wholly unique.

Listening to these two gentlemen try to let folks down easy was one of the things that makes this discussion interesting to me: the suggestion that the petitioners are idealists asking for the moon from a Landmark Board Member who knows political reality.

abstract: 'Using an effective Hamiltonian of mutiferroic BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) as a toy model, we explore the effect of the coefficient, $C$, characterizing the strength of the spin-current interaction, on physical properties. We observe that for larger $C$ values and below a critical temperature, the magnetic moments organize themselves in a novel cycloid which propagates along a low-symmetry direction and is associated with a structural phase transition from polar rhombohedral to a polar triclinic state. We emphasize that both of these magnetic and structural transitions are results of a remarkable self-organization of [*different*]{} solutions of the spin-current model.'

    Novel magnetic arrangement and structural phase transition\
    induced by spin-lattice coupling in multiferroics
---

Multiferroic materials form an exciting type of materials which can have multiple ferroic properties in the same phase [@MF1; @MF2] such as (anti)ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity etc... Out of the different kinds of multiferroics, the ones possessing both ferroelectric and magnetic orders have drawn particular attention [@J1; @J2; @C1; @C2]. This is because the magneto-electric coupling between these two orders can lead to the control of magnetism by electric field, or, vice-versa, to the manipulation of electric properties by the application of magnetic field (such control is attractive for the design of original devices and is also of academic interest). One particularly known and important example of such coupling is provided by the so-called spin-current model [@Katsura1"

608,18,19917,"Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell unveiled plans Thursday to introduce legislation that could be used to force homeless people and their belongings off public property.

The administration plans to introduce two bills drafted by city attorneys: one targeting the belongings of homeless people by outlawing sidewalk obstructions from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and another to prevent people from “lodging” on public property if shelter facilities are available.

“Lodging” is defined as occupying a place temporarily, sleeping or resting, and refusing to leave the area. According to the draft, officers would arrange transportation to a nearby shelter if the person is willing. If the person refuses shelter and refuses to leave within an hour, they could be arrested and charged with a petty misdemeanor.

“You don’t get a pass because you’re homeless,” Caldwell said. “This is the tough love part.”

Cory Lum/Civil Beat

City laws already prohibit people from keeping personal property on public property for more than 24 hours or in a park after-hours.

The current sit-lie ban only affects Waikiki and other business areas around the island during business hours, he said. The proposed new ban “would apply no matter what time and it would prohibit any form of sitting and lying in any form of sidewalk anywhere around the island,” he said.

Caldwell said he anticipates the public lodging bill to generate opposition and possibly a legal challenge. He noted that the bill still must go through the City Council and public hearings process.

He announced the proposed legislation at a press conference in a city-owned Kakaako lot, across the street from a small homeless encampment that he gestured toward at one point.

Violators of the second proposed bill to expand the prohibition on keeping possessions on public sidewalks could receive a $100 fine or have to do community service. A person could be cited if their property leaves less than 36 inches of sidewalk space for pedestrians, and they refuse to comply with a warning.

The mayor first mentioned his support for an islandwide sit-lie ban in his April State of the City address. Sidewalk sit-lie bans have been expanded by the City Council since the first was instituted in Waikiki in 2014.

The most recent homeless count found that 4,495 homeless people lived on Oahu, a 9 percent decline from 2017’s count.

609,28,20506,"Concerns raised that current US and UK surveillance system is ‘ripe for further abuse under an autocratic, power-obsessed president’

Privacy activists, human rights campaigners and former US security officials have expressed fears over the prospect of Donald Trump controlling the vast global US and UK surveillance network.

They criticised Barack Obama’s administration for being too complacent after the 2013 revelations by the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, and making only modest concessions to privacy concerns rather than carrying out major legislative changes.

The concern comes after Snowden dismissed fears for his safety if Trump, who called him “a spy who has caused great damage in the US”, was to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin to have him extradited.

Snowden, in a video link-up from Moscow with a Netherlands-based tech company on Thursday, said it would be “crazy to dismiss” the prospect of Trump doing a deal but if personal safety was a major concern for him, he would not have leaked the top-secret documents in the first place.

Snowden, wanted by the US on charges under the Espionage Act, found asylum in Russia in 2013 but his visa is due to expire in July.



Privacy and human rights campaigners in the US and UK say a Trump presidency will tip the balance between surveillance and privacy decisively towards the former. The UK surveillance agency GCHQ is so tied up with America’s NSA, often doing work on its behalf, it could find itself facing a series of ethical dilemmas.

On the campaign trail, Trump made an ambiguous remark about wishing he had access to surveillance powers.

“I wish I had that power,” he said while talking about the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. “Man, that would be power.”

Although Obama’s administration introduced a few modest concessions to the privacy lobby following Snowden’s revelations, he left the rest of the surveillance apparatus untouched. His approach has been to offer a modicum of transparency, much of it forced on him by the courts, in place of reform.

And learning any thing from that defunct KHATAMI is foolhardy not only for you even for your successor?

US President George W. Bush said in an interview made public late yesterday that he was ""interested in learning more"" about the Iranian Government.

In a rare change of tone toward the Islamic state, Mr. Bush told The Wall Street Journal that he had personally signed off on granting a US visa to former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who made a series of speeches in the US this week.

“I was interested to hear what he had to say,” Mr. Bush said. “I'm interested in learning more about the Iranian Government, how they think, what people think within the Government.”

Dear President Bush, if so far you have not gathered necessary knowledge concerning a government ran by CLERGIES, and don’t know how they run it, how they get their intelligence, what kind of propaganda firms are behind their think pad, who runs the regime, what is behind it, then you have been wasting yours & as well as our time for the last seven years!

More over they do not know how they are running the country & the Government them selves, what are you going to learn from those who do not know what is the function of any government?

And learning any thing from that defunct KHATAMI is foolhardy not only for you even for your successor?

If president Bush wish to give the last ultimatum to Mullahs before start of
possible war then inviting Khatami is right thing to do, but if the goal is appeasing Mullahs for few more years then I don't agree.
We will find out about the truth in next few weeks. Actions or No Actions tell us what is the real direction.

Quote:

4. The United States must deliver an unequivocal ultimatum to the Iranian regime to step down peacefully and immediately, and transfer power to a team of Iranian and Iranian-American leaders; this team would set up a referendum under US and international supervision with military presence of US, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands in Iran as the peacekeeper.

============

René Leriche was a 20^th^ century French surgeon generally known in medicine for the syndrome that carries his name, the Leriche syndrome in the aorto-iliac occlusive disease. Although Dr. Leriche's legacy remains in the domain of vascular medicine, his research comprehended bone pathology and surgical management of pain. His outstanding clinical and academic work earned him a good reputation among his students and colleagues, leaving his mark on future generations of bright surgeons such as Jean Kunlin, Jao Cid dos Santos, Michael DeBakey, René Fontaine and others.

History
-------

René Leriche was born in 1879 in the city of Roanne, central France. In 1906 he received his medical degree from the University of Lyon with the thesis *""The Resection of the Stomach for Cancer""* \[[@b1-cm-89-176],[@b2-cm-89-176]\].

While in Lyon, he was a colleague of Alexis Carrel (1873--1944) until Carrel's departure to Montreal in 1904. They were both pupils of Professor Mathieu Jaboulay (1860--1913) who performed at the"

                   III. MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT

       Presidential now seeks to avail itself of any preclusive effect its success in obtaining the

confessed judgment in Maryland might have on this case. As such, it has filed a motion for

summary judgment on eleven of Defendants’ twelve affirmative defenses—all but breach of

contract—as well as Defendants’ request that this Court void the entire Forbearance Agreement,

on the theory that Defendants missed their chance to proffer these defenses and this request when

they did not raise them in Maryland. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants

Presidential’s motion for partial summary judgment.

                                       A. Legal Standard

       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that a court must grant summary judgment

when “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant

is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “Material” facts are those

capable of affecting the substantive outcome of the litigation, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,

477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986), and a dispute regarding those facts is “genuine” if there is enough

evidence on the record for a reasonable jury to find for the non-movant, Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S.

372, 380 (2007).

       On summary judgment, the movant bears the initial burden of identifying portions of the

record that demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. See Fed. R. Civ. P.

625,17,5095,"Art car

An art car is a vehicle that has had its appearance modified as an act of personal artistic expression. Art cars are often driven and owned by their creators, who are sometimes referred to as ""Cartists"".

Most car artists are ordinary people with no artistic training. Artists are largely self-taught and self funded, though some mainstream trained artists have also worked in the art car medium. Most others agree that creating and driving an art car daily is its own reward. Artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and others have designed BMW Art Cars and their work has been reflected in racing cars like the BMW V12 LMR.

History

There is some disagreement  as to what precisely led to the growth of the art car subculture. It can be seen as a twining together of several influences - the hippie-themed VWs of the late 1960s, the lowrider, as well as a Merry Pranksters' creation, the decorated school bus known as Further.

During the late 1960s, singer Janis Joplin had a psychedelically-painted Porsche 356 and John Lennon, a paisley Rolls Royce. Partly in imitation, the late 1960s/early 1970s counterculture featured many painted VW Buses (sometimes with a peace symbol in place of the giant VW logo) and customized vehicles (e.g. a customized 1977 Cadillac Fleetwood seen in the film Escape from New York). Likewise, as a way of evading The Muppet Movie's main antagonist ""Doc Hopper"", Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem paint up the borrowed 1951 ""bullet-nose"" Studebaker Commander two-door owned by Fozzie Bear's uncle in a psychedelic manner, for Fozzie and Kermit the Frog to escape safely, at least for a while.

Artist Larry Fuente was among the first to take motorized appliqué to the limit with his ""Mad Cad.""  Later, artists Jackie Harris and David Best contributed their works to the art car world.

An art car community began to cohere in the 1990s, inspired by movies and books with a wide underground following, and the development of innovative art display venues such as Burning Man. One of the main"
626,6,5933,"OTTAWA - Canada's economy performed relatively well last year, but not enough to displace Germany as the top country in the Group of Seven big industrial nations, the Bank of Montreal says.

The chartered bank's annual report card for economic performance puts Canada slightly ahead of where it stood in 2010 cumulatively on five benchmarks, including unemployment and government deficits.

But the combined score of 81.6 is well back of Germany's 89.2 out of a maximum 100.

The scorecard suggests that the Harper government's contention that Canada leads the G7 in economic performance is somewhat of an exaggeration.

While Canada scores higher than the G7 average, exporting powerhouse Germany tops Canada in four of five major categories — jobless rate, inflation, government fiscal health and the current account balance with the rest of the world.

In the fifth category — credit rating — the two countries are tied with the top AAA grade.

""No. 2 is OK,"" said economist Benjamin Reitzes, who compiled the report. ""We've been consistently in the upper echelons in the G7.""

Reitzes noted that Germany has been more aggressive than Canada in reigning in government deficits. The European country has a deficit of only 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product, while Canada's combined federal-provincial shortfall is five per cent the size of the economy.

The other area in which Germany does substantially better is trade. The collapse of exports since the recession leaves Canada with a current account deficit of about three per cent of GDP, while Germany still enjoys a massive surplus.

Surprisingly, the U.S. is second last in the G7, mostly due to its high unemployment rate and budgetary deficit valued at 10 per cent of GDP, the worst in the group. Not such a surprise is that Italy, which is in the midst of a sovereign debt crisis, trails the group.

Canada averaged 7.5 per cent unemployment in 2011, and inflation was 2.9 per cent overall.

Reitzes said there's a chance Canada could regain top spot next year if expectations for growth are borne out.

In a separate report released Wednesday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said Canada's economy is likely to continue to experience positive, if moderate, growth in 2012. It predicts output will grow by two per cent next year, followed by a 2.6 per cent expansion in 2013 — both numbers similar to the consensus reading of economists.

By comparison, Germany's economy is forecast to barely register any growth at 0.6 per cent next year.

The BMO report shows that Canada is doing well in relative — if not in absolute terms. It means that in a contest of struggling nations, Canada's problems are milder. On average, industrialized nations overall had a worst 2011 than 2010.

""Relative to the world we're in a decent spot, but this is the second lowest score since 1994, so our economy has performed better,"" Reitzes said.

The Chamber of Commerce outlook is that the trend of weak growth will continue in 2012, with Canada outperforming most industrialized countries.

Most of Canada's engines of growth have slowed, the business organization said, including consumer spending, housing activity, government spending, and exports, which while rising, remain below pre-slump levels. The bright spot in the grey picture is business investment.

The chamber pointed out that with Europe still a question mark, the outlook for Canada is subject to a downside shock if the continent fails to contain its sovereign debt problems. But Canada's"

To study beta-cell development with single-cell resolution, we developed technologies capable of monitoring the contribution of beta-cells to islet growth and function. We show that the islet harbors beta-cells from distinct temporal lineages that differ in their proliferative and functional properties. Lineage tracing to distinguish younger and older populations during islet maturation shows that the older beta-cells exhibit robust glucose responsiveness, whereas the younger beta-cells are more proliferative and less functional. While the period of islet remodeling provides a rich source of heterogeneity, we find that this heterogeneity diminishes as the islet approaches its mature state. Our study establishes a new model allowing to investigate the dynamic nature of beta-cell heterogeneity.

MEMORANDUM OPINION[1]
------------
          A jury convicted Appellant Jessie
James Layton of possession of a firearm by a felon.[2]  The jury assessed punishment at seventeen
years’ confinement.  In one issue, Layton
argues that the trial court erred by admitting Layton’s videotaped statement to
police without redaction of statements Layton believes were threats against
certain individuals and their families. 
We will affirm.
          On January 12, 2009, police received
information that Layton possessed stolen property related to a home burglary,
including jewelry and guns.  The police
went to an RV park managed by Layton’s stepfather—Jeff Simpson—to perform a
“knock-and-talk” regarding the stolen property. 
Layton also lived at the RV park.  While at the RV park,
police obtained consent to search the property from both Simpson and Layton.  Inside a storage building, police found two
guns and a green duffle bag containing numerous pieces of jewelry.  The police arrested Layton, a convicted felon
who had been released from prison roughly three months before, for the charge
of possession of a firearm by a felon.
          The next day, at Layton’s request, investigator
Gay Johnson spoke with Layton.  After

Rib-Eye (Delmonico)

The most dynamic flavor fireworks in the steak family come from the rib-eye. It’s not as tender as the other cuts you find in a steakhouse, but that just means you enjoy the flavor more as you chew a little longer. That’s a fair trade.

This steak variation calls for a spicy Zinfandel. Zins, as they are affectionately known, are explosive with a diverse array of forest fruit ripeness that nicely contrasts the meatiness of the rib-eye. While some entry-level versions can be a bit heavy on the palate, well-balanced versions like the Kendall-Jackson Vintner’s Reserve Mendocino County bottling have the acidic vivacity to stand-up to the marbling of this chunkier cut.

Porterhouse (T-Bone)

The Porterhouse is the heavyweight of these cuts, containing both strip and tenderloin. A Porterhouse has more of the tenderloin than the T-Bone, also a colossal slab to undertake but slightly less daunting.

The combination of these two cuts calls for a more refined red that can handle them both - something not as light as a Pinot Noir and not as heavy as a Cabernet Sauvignon. Syrah provides the perfect solution, offering tannins more finessed and along the lines of Pinot Noir as well as plenty of hearty black fruits more akin to Cabernet Sauvignon. If the weather is warmer or you’re more in the mood for a medium-body wine, reach for the K-J Vintner’s Reserve Syrah. If it’s chilly outside or you’re craving a full-throttle wine, turn instead to the Jackson Estate Alisos Hills Syrah.

Skirt and Flank

This duo might sound provocative if we weren’t talking about steak! That aside, these two cuts share a unique appeal: they’re less expensive than the cuts mentioned above. Skirt tends to be chewy and so takes well to tenderizer and marinades. It’s also rather fatty. Flank comes off the belly, isn’t as fatty and works well with a sauce or compound butter.

636,8,9607,"That's right, Conquer Club has now reached the 200 Map mark and we're celebrating with a few exciting treats for the community!

Congratulations to Seamus76 and V.J. who created our 200th MapTribal War Florida. The development topic for which can be found here and it has just gone beta! So head over to Join a Game OR Start your own Game and try it out!

All Maps are Open!

To celebrate Conquer Club reaching the 200 Map mark we are opening all of our limited edition maps up to public play for a whole week! That means that all of our 5 limited edition maps (St.Patricks Day, Easter, Christmas, 2010 World Cup and 2011 World Cup) which are currently closed will be open for you all to enjoy for the next week

[Vote] Conquer Club's Favourite Maps!

To celebrate this milestone on Conquer Club, we want everyone who possibly can to come and vote for their favourite maps! We want to find Conquer Club's most popular maps and celebrate the diversity we have here on Conquer Club.

All 200 Maps have been randomly placed into FOUR categories, each category has their own topic and poll.

How it works:

Click on the links below to take you to each of the 4 categories.

Vote for your favourite maps in each category, each category is made up of 50 Maps.

You are permitted to vote for 15 maps in each category.

You DO NOT have to use all 15 votes but that is how many you are allowed to use.

You CAN change your vote(s) at any time.

The Favourite Map Polls will be open for 2 Weeks Ending on the 2nd of November 2011.

Ready for something a bit different? Well here we go, we've taken 5 Conquer Club Maps and made 5 subtle alterations to each of them! You're job is to locate and identify ALL FIVE changes that we've made to each map and write them down in the spaces provided.

For those who can correctly locate and identify all 5 differences for any ONE map, they will receive a General Achievement Medal!

As a bonus, anyone who correctly locates and identifies EVERY difference on EVERY map will receive a Second General Achievement Medal, at the end of the contest!

How it works:

You have a 24 hour window in which to complete each set of differences. A Countdown timer is displayed at the top of the web page telling you how long you have left.

You MUST use your CC username so that we know who to award medals to, if you don't then we cannot verify and award you your medal.

You MUST use the same mail address for all sessions (Everytime you participate). If you don't then our scoring system will not be able to add up your scores correctly.

You MUST fill in ALL FIVE DIFFERENCES to receive a medal, once you submit there is no going back you should not submit a partially incomplete entry.

You should try to explain the difference in the best way you can. There are no character limits.

If you can't find all 5 at once, write down the ones you have and come back later to find the rest.

If you can't find all the differences within the timeframe, there are 5 different maps to try, each on a different day (see below for date/times).

VERY IMPORTANT: You must not post any answers in this topic, if you do, you will not receive a medal. Any answers posted here will be seen as deliberate attempts to ruin the spirit and fun of the event and may result in other consequences.

To celebrate Conquer Club reaching the 200 Map Mark we are also having a tournament involving all 200 maps. We need 160 players for the tournament, you can check out all the details in the tournament topic linked below.

Note: The tournament is now full, and is only accepting reserves.

Prizes include 12 months of Premium Membership as well as General Achievement Medals for all Finalists

And last but certainly not least i would like to thank all map-makers past and present for their contributions to this great website. Without them we'd have none of this, so please show your appreciation by saying thanks in this thread. Thanks to all our Cartographers past and present for making the Map Foundry what it is today as well as our 3 Foundry Foremen past and present AndyDufresne, MrBenn and thenobodies80.

It’s good to mix it up a bit with different types of posts. So, in your email to me, you said you had something you wanted to tell my husband?

Boaz Grady, Mitch’s brother in Mitch’s Win

Boaz: Yes, you’re right. I do have something to say. I understand I make him uneasy in Mitch’s Win because I did a lot of crying, but life isn’t always pretty. There are some unpleasant things that happen in this world. Just because they aren’t pleasant, does that mean we should shove it under the rug and pretend like it never happened? I lost my wife during childbirth, and the worst part of the experience was that she kept begging me to save her and I couldn’t. So not only did she die, but I kept thinking there must have been something I could have done but didn’t. It took a long time before I came to grips with the fact that I did all I could and the rest was out of my control.

Ruth: I got to tell you, after hearing that, I think this is going to be a serious post. I haven’t done an interview that wasn’t funny before.

Boaz: So? You just said you like to mix things up and do different types of posts. Well, this can be the time you write an interview that isn’t funny.

Ruth: Point taken.

Boaz: But it’s not all gloom and doom. I mean, you plan to write my book.

Ruth: Yes, and I’m not going to call it “Boaz Weeps Again”. I’m calling it “Boaz’s Wager”. That’s where you’ll have your romance. But in order to appreciate how things will be for you in that book, I thought it was important to show where you were in Mitch’s Win.

640,10,7391,"In an essay written in 1945, George Orwell drew two conclusions about antisemitism in Britain. First, that “above a certain intellectual level people are ashamed of being antisemitic”. Second, that “antisemitism is an irrational thing”.

Much of what Orwell captured in that essay remains pertinent to modern Britain. Antisemitism is, like all prejudice, still irrational and still much discussed but little understood. Not only must young Jews wrestle with the complexities of these prejudices, they must also resist the fatalism that antisemitism will be a permanent feature of the British left.

Orwell’s postwar world is not our own. Britain was then home to around 400,000 Jews, compared to just 260,000 today. Jews make up about 0.4% of Britain’s population.

Most importantly, there was no Israel. After six months working as a policy adviser for Jeremy Corbyn, it was clear to me that the way Corbyn and those around him think about Jewish people is shaped by a frenetic anti-imperialism, focused on Israel and America. Without a hint of irony, one senior aide asked that I remove the greeting “Chag Kasher VeSameach” from Corbyn’s Passover message, for fear that Corbyn’s supporters might think the use of Hebrew “Zionist”.

In modern Britain, it is no longer true that intellectuals are ashamed of antisemitism. In the eyes of the leaders of the British far left, Israel’s occupation – for some, even Israel’s existence – offers a firm moral basis for antipathy towards Jews in Israel or, more ambitiously, towards Jews everywhere.

Antisemitism among the British left continues to be about capitalism too. The familiar image endures of the Jew as the master of usury, the sedentary banker and financier, the archetypal neoliberal even. This persistent trope of Jews as the ultimate capitalists reinforces the view of those on the left who resent capitalism per se – rather than, say, unrestrained markets – and feel that Jews cannot be victims because they have money and they have Israel.

Orwell argued that antisemitism was driven by a fear"

643,17,6169," quality of the system is maintained only by keeping the transmission bit energy constant. In order to keep the transmission bit energy constant, the amount of overall power requirement differs from transmission rate to transmission rate.
Hereinafter, a description will be given of a method for configuring gain factors for an uplink Dedicated Physical Data Channel (hereinafter referred to as “DPDCH”), to which an uplink Dedicated Channel (hereinafter referred to as “DCH”) is mapped, on a TF-by-TF basis.
A network represented by a Radio Network Controller (hereinafter referred to as “RNC”) configures transmission power, which is necessary for each TF to maintain constant quality, by using gain factors. A gain factor configuration method is classified into a signaled gain factor scheme and a computed gain factor scheme. In the signaled gain factor scheme, the network informs a UE of TF-by-TF gain factors through upper layer signaling. In the computed gain factor scheme, the network informs a UE only of gain factors for a reference TF Combination (hereinafter referred to as “TFC”) representing a combination of reference TFs and transport channels, and the UE personally calculates and determines gain factors for the other TFs based on the gain factors for the reference TFC.
The conventional computed gain factor scheme is expressed by the following Equation (1). As described below, a ratio of a gain factor for a specific TFC to a gain factor for a reference TFC is given as a ratio of a transmission rate for a desired TFC and a transmission rate for the reference TFC:
                              A          j                =                                                            β                                  d                 ,                  ref                                                            β                                  c                 ,                  ref                                                      ·                                                            L                  ref              "
644,1,6730," re-scaling $t\rightarrow t/(R_g/c)$ make the problem independent of the black hole mass $M$. Further, since we consider non-radiative flows, the density $\rho$, the pressure terms $P_g$, $Q$, and the electromagnetic terms $B^2$, $J^2$ in equations (1)-(4) are all proportional to the mass injection rate, $\dot M_{\rm inj}$. Therefore, we may eliminate $\dot M_{\rm inj}$ from the equations and consider only the scaled solutions.

When we run a time-dependent simulation using the above code, the system generally goes through an initial transient phase before relaxing to a steady state. Since we are mostly interested in the final steady state flow, we continue the calculations for a fairly long time — long enough that we feel from looking at the results that the model has reached a steady state. Even in steady state, the flow patterns are often time-dependent, so we need to consider the time-averaged properties of the flow. Typically, it takes about ten Keplerian rotational periods, as measured at $R_{out}$, to reach a steady-state, and we need to average over a few Keplerian periods in the final state to calculate its average properties.

All our models have been calculated assuming the resistivity parameter $\eta_0=0.3$. It has been found in previous MHD simulations (Igumenshchev & Narayan 2002) that this value of $\eta_0$ is reasonable. On the one hand, $\eta_0$ is small enough that it does not excessively smooth out small-scale magnetic structures. At the same time it is large enough to prevent serious loss of energy through numerical field reconnection.

Simulations with Toroidal Injected Field
----------------------------------------

The first set of simulations we describe involve the injection of matter with a toroidal field topology. These simulations were done with $A_r=A_\phi=0$ and with $A_z$ equal to the value given in equation (8). As explained in §2.2, this leads to a purely toroidal injected field. As the accreting matter moves in, however, poloidal field of either sign is generated locally, though the total magnetic flux through the equatorial plane is still zero to within the accuracy of truncation errors.

We have calculated a range of models with different values of the parameter $\beta_0$ (which describes the strength of the injected magnetic field) and with different numbers of nested Cartesian sub"

C.M. Punk: We have dress code violations. For a while, the big thing was that people who wear suits get ahead. I’m not a suit and tie kind of guy. I wear a suit once a year, for the Hall of Fame, or if I have to go to a funeral or something. It’s just not me. And I think our travel is ridiculous enough. When we go overseas, it’s sometimes two flights to get to where we’re going, a three-hour bus ride, and then you’re in a hotel for four or five hours. You have to eat and try to work out, and you’re lugging your bags around. And you’re getting the crap beat out of you on a nightly basis. The last thing I’m worried about is wearing nice, uncomfortable shoes. I’ve never worn a dress show that’s been comfortable. I’ve always just worn dress shoes. On more than one occasion, I’ve heard that a champion should dress like a champion. But I’m a champion because of who I am. Who I am is not that guy. If everybody wears three-piece suits, everyone looks the same. When you hear “C.M. Punk,” what do you think of? I’m covered in tattoos. For a while there, I had a crazy hobo beard. And you want me to shatter that illusion I’m projecting by wearing an Armani suit? Not only am I not that guy; that doesn’t make sense business-wise for me.

653,9,24149," the discharge in bankruptcy and related fresh start doctrine."" In re Klein, 64 B.R. 372, 375 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1986). Furthermore, by requiring prompt and early creditor action on discharge issues, the debtor and his or her creditors are enabled to know early in the proceeding where they stand, which allows them to make better informed decisions regarding the bankruptcy case in its entirety. Neeley v. Murchison, 815 F.2d at 346-47.
There is, of course, a line of cases which arguably hold the contrary, concluding that a creditor who receives no notice or misguiding notice from the bankruptcy clerk will not be barred from filing an untimely complaint. See South Dakota Cement Plant v. Jimco Ready Mix Co., 57 B.R. 396 (D.S.D.1986); Matter of Hershkovitz, 101 B.R. 816 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1989); In re Riso, 57 B.R. 789 (D.N.H.1986); In re Sibley, 71 B.R. 147 (Bankr.D.Mass.1987); In re Schwartz & Meyers, 64 B.R. 948 (Bankr.S. D.N.Y.1986); In re Hickey, 58 B.R. 106 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1986). I find several of these cases distinguishable on the facts and, further, to the extent their analyses depart from the one I adopt, I respectfully disagree.
Jimco Ready Mix and Schwartz & Meyers involved the inadvertent failure of the clerk to transmit notice of the deadline prior to its expiration. The courts found that the notice requirements of Rules 4007(c) and 4004(a) were mandatory, requiring that the court must give all creditors not less than 30 or 25 days notice respectively of the time fixed for filing complaints. ""That sentence [of Rule 4007(c)] appears to be the necessary predicate and trigger to the running of the 60 day period. We so hold."" In re Schwartz & Meyers, 64 B.R. at 953. This analysis is inapplicable to the instant controversy, where sufficient notice, the necessary predicate, was given, and the creditor had actual notice of the bankruptcy case.
In re Riso involved a chapter 7 case filed in a Florida court, from which the clerk's office sent notice of the deadline for filing complaints. Venue was then transferred to New Hampshire, where the court staff erroneously sent out notice of a new deadline. A creditor who relied on the second notice was allowed to file what would otherwise have been an untimely complaint, as the bankruptcy court concluded that it ""has the inherent equitable power to correct its own mistake [in order to prevent] an injustice."" 57 B.R. at 793.[5] There, the new notice was sent on a form which was imprinted with the words ""By the Court, James E. Yacos, Bankruptcy Judge,"" although it was not signed by the judge. *265 The court reasoned that reliance by the creditor on the mistaken deadline outweighed the prejudice to the debtor where both were equally innocent. To the extent that Riso stands for the proposition that a creditor may rely on an apparent order of the court setting deadlines, and that the court may extend the objection deadline to correct one of its ""own"" mistakes, finding authority to do so under 11 U"

No. 81-1751.

Submitted Dec. 17, 1981.Decided May 11, 1982.

James E. Wollrab, St. Louis, Mo., for appellant.
Thomas E. Dittmeier, U. S. Atty., Richard L. Poehling, Asst. U. S. Atty., St. Louis, Mo., for appellee.
Before LAY, Chief Judge, and HENLEY and ARNOLD, Circuit Judges.
HENLEY, Circuit Judge.


1
Appellant Eddie McCain appeals his conviction on a charge of possession of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).  His primary contentions are that the district court1 erred in refusing to suppress evidence obtained through both an impermissible, warrantless search and a defective search warrant.


2
We affirm the judgment of the district court.


3
The facts pertinent to this appeal date to the year preceding McCain's arrest on August 4, 1980.  During this year, on numerous occasions, Officers Nicholas Frederiksen and Robert Thomure of the St. Louis, Missouri police department engaged in surveillance of the 4500 block of Delmar for traffic in heroin.  On August 3 and 4, 1980, the officers received information from a confidential, reliable informant that narcotics could be found in McCain's premises2 in this block.


4
At 6:00 p.m. on August 4, 1980 the officers drove down the alley at the rear of the premises for the purpose of corroborating certain information received from the informant.  At this time, they observed one Luther Williams with a vial at the rear of the building.  Williams was immediately arrested.


5
At the time of Williams' arrest, Officer Frederiksen stepped inside the rear door of McCain's machine shop at 4510 Delmar.  Frederiksen identified himself as a police officer, and shouted to see whether any other persons were present.  The record suggests that Frederiksen was concerned to determine whether police presence had been detected.  Frederiksen left when he received no response.3


6
Officers Frederiksen and Thomure then applied for and received a state search warrant for ""4510 Delmar, offices and work area of a machine shop.""  With the help of back-up police personnel, they executed the warrant within four hours of Williams"

In last month’s column, we looked at images of sound waves with and without distortion. I’d like to examine those photos again for some more analysis.

In Figures 1 and 2 we can see that the waveforms have about the same amplitude (vertical height when viewed on an oscilloscope). Amplitude corresponds to the size of the signal in volts or electrical strength, thus the bigger the waveform the louder the signal. This is a general rule and there are always exceptions – test equipment can be set to see things in many different ways. However, for this discussion, remember that a bigger wave represents a louder signal.

In Figure 1 we have a nice, round sine wave. This represents a clean signal with no distortion. Figure 2 shows a square wave and believe me, it is nasty sounding. In the lab, we “look” at audio gear with a square wave running through it. A square wave, although not pleasing"

VMWare: guest machine internet working randomly

I have an issue with the internet in my VMWare guest machine working very randomly (mostly not working) and I am not sure what the issue might be.
Sometimes the internet works (this also includes possibility to ssh to the host), but most of the time it doesn't.
Restarting networking doesn't help, nor any ifdown/ifup's. The only situation when it might start working is restarting the whole VM. And even then it starts working perhaps one time in 10.
The only potential issue I have noticed so far is that when it doesn't work, VM network adapters' MAC addresses are swapped - while if it works, they are as configured.

However, Macmillan and Cancer Research UK say there is no evidence to support or disprove the idea that spa-ing with cancer is dangerous.

To spa or not to spa?

This dilemma has historically led spas to err on the side of caution and refuse to treat those who are not yet through a five-year remission period. But two NHS Trusts are leading the way with recommending complementary therapies to cancer patients. At The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a specialist cancer hospital in London, complementary therapies including acupuncture, massage therapy, reflexology and yoga are available free of charge to NHS patients. Similarly, The Christie Trust in Manchester offers treatments including massage, aromatherapy, acupuncture/acupressure and reflexology to patients as part of its rehabilitation programme.

Consultant oncologist and Tpot (a specialist spa training company – more later) ambassador Dr Fiona Thistlethwaite at The Christie Trust has been on both sides of the fence following her breast cancer diagnosis three years ago. She says:

""I have often heard from my patients how receiving complementary therapies alongside chemotherapy helped them to cope with their situation. In May 2013, the unthinkable happened when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I benefitted greatly from regular massage therapy throughout the course of my chemotherapy treatment and beyond, particularly when I was making my return to work.""

She adds:

""I found massage relaxed my tense muscles and gave me some quiet time to switch off from the stressful experience I was going through. Now that I am back up and running at work, I encourage my patients to take up the offer of complementary therapies such as massage therapy. My personal experience has given me insight into the positive role they can play during a cancer patient's journey.""

Available treatments

With little medical research and a lack of consensus among the medical community, whether and how you choose to spa may come down to personal choice. If you decide to go to a spa, you may want to choose one that offers specialist post-cancer treatments.

In the past few years, there has been a movement within the spa industry that is looking to educate therapists and spa managers about what is and what isn't possible. Tpot – The Power of Touch – is the brainchild of spa training specialist Michelle Hammond and Abi Wright, founder of Spa Breaks. Their mission is to educate industry professionals to ensure that no spa or salon will turn away a person with cancer by 2018.

Many spas now offer specialist retreats. St Brides Spa Hotel in Pembrokeshire sent their team on a Complementary Therapy in Cancer Care course run by Angela Green at Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff. Karen Clevely, spa manager at St Brides Spa Hotel, says:

""St Brides has introduced a 15-minute consultation and health questionnaire for cancer patients, the therapists then recommend the most effective and safe treatments on offer. Our Coastal Retreat oncology care package has been devised for cancer patients and we avoid the area of radiotherapy from two weeks before treatment until six weeks afterwards.""

In that waiting, I found myself remembering Aidan. I always remember him -- I think of him every day -- but this was different, stronger. I remembered the smell of him after a bath. I remembered the weight of him in my arms. I remembered the softness of his hair, the deep chocolate of his eyes, the way his far-too-rare smiles lit his face?and I missed him, more than I'd missed him in years. The timing was eerie; I was due in September, ten years since the October of Aidan's birth, in that fall season when I always feel sad and vulnerable, and suffer most for the loss of my baby.

In this new cycle the Brown/Tufts AITRP proposes to focus on longer term training, advanced degree training at either Brown or Tufts. Trainees may elect to participate in MPH, Masters Programs in Biostatistics, or Clinical Research, as well as PhD programs. In addition, we have developed one year, post doctoral mentored research training courses in a variety of clinical research disciplines, including Molecular Virology, Clinical Trial Research Design, HIV Prevention Research, Women's Health, Nutrition and Metabolic Studies, as well as Pharmacology.

Why does the US House of Representatives have a ceremonial mace, but the Senate does not?

The US House of Representatives has its own ceremonial mace, which was apparently one of the first things that they authorized once they met for the first time.  However, the Senate does not seem to have an equivalent.  It has a gavel, which fills a similar (albeit much less impressive) niche, but as far as I can tell, the gavel acquired its importance from the fact it has been used for so long.
Why did the early Senate not authorize a mace for itself?  Was it even discussed?

A:

The House's tradition of a ceremonial mace descends from the British House of Commons:

Ceremonial maces originated in the Ancient Near East, where they were used as symbols of rank and authority across the region during the late Stone Age, Bronze Age, and early Iron Age.....
The earliest ceremonial maces in France and England were practical weapons intended to protect the king's person, borne by the Sergeants-at-Arms, a royal bodyguard established in France by Philip II, and in England probably by Richard I,....
As the custom of having sergeants' maces began to die out about 1650, the large maces borne before the mayor or bailiffs came into general use. Thomas Maundy functioned as the chief maker of maces during the English Commonwealth. He made the mace for the House of Commons in 1649. This mace is still in use today, though without the original head.

The tradition continues for much the same reason as why the House of Representatives shares the same moniker prefix as the British House of Commons - it addresses the same legislative function. As in the British tradition, the U.S. Constitution specifies that:

Article II Section 7
All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives;....

Although the U.K. House of Lords now also uses a ceremonial mace that tradition originates only in 1876, as a supplement to the function of the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, long after the U.S. Senate established its own procedures.

Update
A search of the House Journal for the first five sessions of Congress for ""sergeant-at-arms"", ""serjeant-at-arms"", and ""mace"" (in relevant contexts) turns up on Monday, April 13, 1789:

VB.Net Deserialize JSON object that contains an array of strings instead of key value pairs

I'm working with an API that returns JSON. All of the serializing and deserializing has been straightforward so far using the JavaScriptSerializer class from System.Web.Script.Serialization. There is an an endpoint that can return errors and doesn't use KVP in its errors list (not sure why, violates their structure for the rest of the api).
I'm having trouble figuring out the class structure to deserialize it.
Example return:
{
""status"": ""failed"",
""errors"": [
    [
        [""base"", ""error details 1""], 
        [""base"", ""error details 2""], 
        [""base"", ""error details 3""]
    ]
]
}

This is a confusing data structure since everything else is paired. But anyway, I've tried using arrays and lists for the errors piece. Here are my classes:
<Serializable> _
Public Class SearchResult
    Public Property status As String
    Public Property id As Integer
    Public Property errors As List(Of APIError)

    Public Sub New()
        errors = New List(Of APIError)
    End Sub

    Public Shared Function Deserialize(ByVal json_string As String) As SearchResult
        Dim result As SearchResult

        Dim jss As New JavaScriptSerializer()

        Try
            result = jss.Deserialize(json_string, GetType(SearchResult))
        Catch ex As Exception
            result = Nothing
            Debug.WriteLine(""Failed to deserialize "" & json_string)
            Debug.WriteLine(ex.Message)
        End Try

        Return result
    End Function
End Class

And the API Error Class
<Serializable> _
Public Class APIError
    Public Property error_fields() As String
End Class

I have tried making this a list and an array. I am continually getting an exception message that the Class is not supported for deserialization of an array.
I would prefer to use the JSS for deserializing and serializing as I have a difficult time selling my boss on third-party libraries. 
Where am I going wrong? Thanks!

A:

That is one deeply nested array.  Try something like this (untested in VB format):

A little about me, I am a recent grad with my Master’s in Computer Science
(Aug 2019) and Bachelors in Information Technology (Aug 2017). I am currently
volunteering for a non profit as a Python Developer. I carry about roughly a
year’s worth of professional experience in Python, JavaScript and some
JavaScript frameworks while working in an environment that uses JIRA products
to aid CI/CD. Academically, I have about 6 years of experience coding mainly
in Python, Java and C++. I have experience in machine learning but primarily
in different facets of software engineering.

I am a strong proponent of making extensible and maintainable code. I have
been constantly learning to achieve this goal by applying SOLID principles,
design patterns, and practicing TDD, which I believe is the most foolproof
form of software development. I am also been practicing these principles while
taken care I do not over design. I am constantly eager to learn about new
tools and tech that is changing industry as well as working on best practices
for ensuring long term stability and flexibility in production.

I am looking for Software Engineer opportunities that welcome a new grad with

Hi, I’m Vince, I’m looking to join a team as a Backend Software Engineer. I
used to work at a mobile-gaming startup in the Bay Area where I built services
in Go. In more detail, I:

\- Built microservices powered by real-time sports data (NBA and League of

\- Developed libraries used across all services: client SDKs, an internal web
framework, data store clients, validation tools

\- Rolled out testing infrastructure for writing automated tests resulting in
faster development cycles and ongoing test coverage

\- Improved engineering standards by actively contributing to docs and reviews
related to writing idiomatic Go code, web APIs, app architecture, and testing

Sadly, the startup wasn't able to secure a Series A round due to the recent
pandemic and I was a part of the layoffs. Before working in tech, I worked in
finance for 2 years. Thanks for reading, email or message me on LinkedIn if

Hidding Forms; fields using standard jquery versus using JSlink. which approach is better

I want to hide some fields from my Edit & New forms, and i need this to apply to all the subsites. now if i hide the columns from the Content type they will appear again when users modify these columns from the list settings. so i need a way to hide them using scripts, to make sure they will never appear.
so what i did is that i create a js file and i save it inside the Style library on the site collection level:-
$( document ).ready(function() {

$('.ms-formtable nobr:contains(""Item Number"")').closest('tr').hide();
$('.ms-formtable nobr:contains(""Customer Initials"")').closest('tr').hide();
$('.ms-formtable nobr:contains(""Recurrence"")').closest('tr').hide();
$('.ms-formtable nobr:contains(""Workspace"")').closest('tr').hide();
$('.ms-formtable nobr:contains(""All Day Event"")').closest('tr').hide();

});

then inside the New & edit forms i add a reference to the above script,, which hide the columns successfully.
but my question is if hiding columns using standard javaScript is the formal approach to use? or i should be using something such as jslink?
So I have these main questions:-

what are the differences between using standard javaScript & between using JSLINK. and which is the formal and the recommended approach to follow for hidding columns?
is it easy to convert the above script to be expressed in JSLink?

Regards

A:

First, let's just clarify that JSLink is not equivalent to Client Side Rendering.  JSLink is merely a property on SP objects that lets you attach Javascript files to them.
However, the ability to attach a Javascript file to a SP object is enormously useful for CSR.  Using the JSLink property is one of the easiest ways to apply CSR.
And I would say that since CSR is the way SP itself renders things, and MS has exposed this mechanism and enabled you to use it to override the default rendering, then CSR is the ""formal"" way to do things like hiding columns.
In your particular case, using JSLink"
684,15,21254,"L'Amour de la femme vénale

L'Amour de la femme vénale is the French title of a brief essay by French writer Octave Mirbeau on prostitution. Originally published in Bulgarian in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in 1922 as Любовта на продажната жена. It was translated into French by Alexandre Lévy, (the original French text has remained undiscovered to this day), the essay was published in 1994 by Éditions Indigo and Côté Femmes  and was accompanied an introduction by Pierre Michel, a professor specialising the writer Octave Mirbeau, and a preface by historian Alain Corbin. The essay was translated into English and Italian in 2005 by Bérangère de Grandpré.

Chronology

Discovery
Bulgarian historian, Niko Nikov, discovered the essay in booklet form entitled Любовта на продажната жена, which had been published in Plovdiv, by 'Spolouka' in 1922, in the Sofia National Library. The work did not appear in any inventory of Mirbeau’s works, but was authenticated as being written by Mirbeau by Pierre Michel.

Mirbeau had died in 1917, so the 1922 booklet was published five years after his death. It is thought the essay was probably written between 1910 and 1913, possibly in 1912. No French versions or manuscript have been found. There have been a number of theories as to the history of the essay prior to the 1922 publication.
 It may have been a compilation of a series of articles originally in the French or Belgium press. Pierre Michel doubts this theory as there is a high likelihood the original articles would have been known as part of Mirbeau's works. Literature professor Mireille Dottin-Orsini also dismisses this theory. Mirbeau had married Alice Regnault in 1887, a former prostitute who was trying to gain a reputation as a writer. Mirbeau would not have wanted a work about prostitution to be published in France in case it brought attention to his wife's past life.
 The essay may have been written for a Russian intellectual or anarchist review, (Mirbeau's works were well received in Russia at the time). The essay being subsequently translated from Russian to Bulgarian, as many other of his works had been. Dottin-Orsini supports this theory.
 The essay may have been commissioned by a Bulgarian publisher, or submitted as a series of articles for a Bulgarian review. (At the time there was a lot of French influence in Bulgaria). With the start of the Balkan Wars in late 1912, followed by WW1, publication may have been delayed by the hostilities. If correct, this theory would imply the essay was written in 1912.

French translation
The Bulgarian booklet was translated into French by Alexandre-Léon Lévy at the request of Pierre Michel so he could verify that the essay was indeed written by Mirbeau. Lévy's translation was subsequently published by Éditions Indigo – Côté Femmes, with an introduction by Michel and a preface by Alain Corbin, a French historian who specialises in the late 19th century in France, including prostitution.

693,16,27769," signal followed by map representation of some individually measured parameter has to be revisited in order to account for the unprecedented spatial richness of simultaneous signals. This emphasis on the spatial-temporal digital signal processing should be scrutinized for the conventional cardiac signal stages. In this setting, an issue that deserves special attention is the criteria for obtaining bipolar configurations for ECGI-derived EGM, which is not a trivial problem. So far, the ECGI-derived EGMs were computed using the virtual bipolar or Laplacian bipolar, which consider an infinitesimal distance between electrodes \[[@B20-sensors-20-03131],[@B21-sensors-20-03131]\]. However, it is needed to establish a new ECGI-derived EGM in order to increase the scope and usefulness in the clinical practice of cardiac arrhythmia detection and treatment, where the bipolar EGMs are computed with the difference between the unipolar EGMs registered with two electrodes located at a certain distance.

For these purposes, we started by analyzing in this paper the basic stages of conventional cardiac digital signal processing and scrutinized the spatial-temporal implications in ECGI scenarios. Specifically, the stages of baseline wander removal, low-pass filtering, and beat segmentation and synchronization were considered. Note that the analysis was done simultaneously for all the signals, given that the epicardial potentials were obtained simultaneously from the surface electrodes. We then aimed to identify a mathematical operator, thte so-called Digital Signal Processing Operator (DSPO), in order to provide suitable bipolar EGM signals from the ECGI-estimated potentials on the epicardium. Experiments were run with detail in two cases: one from an infarction patient and another from a control subject. Several instruments were used to analyze the spatial-temporal consistency of these basic properties. After scrutinizing these preprocessing and acquisition conditions, the companion paper \[[@B22-sensors-20-03131]\] is devoted to giving further and detailed information on clinical indices on EGM morphology, depolarization, and repolarization properties in terms of their spatial organization and spatial-temporal consistency as well as on the effect of bipolar configurations on them.

The structure of the paper is as follows. First, the usual signal processing stages for the ECGI systems are presented, where the notation used in the article is detailed. Subsequently, the following concepts are described: data used; experiments performed on their ECGI-derived signals; and the results obtained for each experiment, including a separate section for (a) spatial-temporal preprocessing properties, (b) spatial consistency of ECGI-estimated bipolar EGM, and (c) need of time delay for ECGI-estimated bipolar EGMs.

2. Methods and Materials {#sec2-sensors-20-03131}
========================

In this section we introduce the notation for the potentials observed when measuring surfaces and the processing operations performed on them. We after describe several of the possible DSPOs that can be used to obtain the bipolar potentials for their subsequent testing in the experimental section. We also present a methodology for a time-delay analysis. Finally, we describe the data sets used in this work.

2.1. Notation and ECGI Signal Preprocessing Stages {#sec2dot1-sensors-20-03131}
--------------------------------------------------

The notation used in this work can be described as follows. Let *S* denote a two-dimensional continuous surface (or manifold) in a three-dimensional space, and let ${\overline{r}}^{S}$ be the set of points in this surface, which is defined as $${\overline{r}}^{S} \equiv \left\{ \overline{r} \in S,\mspace{1020mu}\mspace{510mu} S \in R^{3} \right\}$$ where $\overline{r}$ stands for the position vector of any point in the three-dimensional space. In our case, surface *S* can be either the epicardium (denoted as *E*) or the torso (denoted as *T*). In terms of the electrical potential changes in space and time, denoted as $v\left( {\overline{r}}^{s},t \right)$, we denote potential fields on the epicardium and on the torso as $$v_{E} \equiv \left\{ v\left( {\overline{r}}^{E},t \right),\mspace{510mu}{\overline{r}}^{E} \in E \right\}\mspace{510mu}{and}\mspace{"

That bit of science-speak roughly translates to ""Even among the largest, most energetic stars, Eta Carinae has done things we can't explain, but find incredibly impressive."" The top item in η Carinae's (η is the Greek letter eta) list of extreme behaviors involves producing a decades-long outburst that caused it to become the second-brightest star in the sky. This outburst released as much energy as a supernova and ejected many times the mass of the Sun. Yet somehow η Carinae remained intact.

Now, researchers have used a series of Hubble images to produce a timeline of the debris left behind by this enigmatic outburst. The new data reveals that this was just the latest in a series of eruptions, and we still can't explain why they happen.

η Carinae is actually a binary star system. η Carinae B, the smaller of the two stars, is still enormous, with up to 60 times the mass of the Sun. η Carinae A, however, is at least 90 solar masses and possibly much larger. Both are expected to be hundreds, if not thousands of times brighter than the Sun. The two share an extreme 5.5 year orbit: their distance varies between 1.6 Astronomical Units (an AU is the average distance between the Earth and Sun) to as much as 30 AU.

Saying much more about the two stars is tough, because they're embedded"

698,25,6403," MLC substrate. This substrate has a cavity to accommodate the smaller connected stacked chips and the uppermost top stacked chip overlies the periphery of the cavity. The peripheral non-bonded C4 bumps on the top chip are then C4 bonded to the surface of the substrate with the smaller stacked chips being positioned and enclosed in the cavity.
The conventional chip underfill process to encapsulate the space between a single chip bonded to a non-cavity substrate surface typically positions the bonded chip above the top of the substrate and then applies the underfill material to the substrate adjacent to the periphery of the chip to be underfilled. Capillary action draws the underfill encapsulated material into the space between the chip and the substrate to form a void free filled space between the chip and the substrate. This technique works very well for a single chip attached to the surface of a substrate but is not reliable for stacked chip assemblies wherein the stacked chips are enclosed in a cavity of a substrate.
Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a stacked integrated circuit chip assembly comprising a plurality of electrically connected chips with the chip assembly being electrically connected to an interconnection substrate forming an electronic package wherein peripheral non-bonded pads on the uppermost top chip of the assembly are electrically connected to pads on the interconnection substrate with the stacked lower chip or chips of the assembly being enclosed in a cavity in the interconnection substrate with the solder connections between the stacked chips and cavity area being effectively sealed (encapsulated) to provide mechanical, electrical and chemical reliability for the electronic package.

700,15,3974,"Bad software is everywhere. One can even claim that every software is bad. Cool companies, tech giants, established companies, all produce bad software. And no, yours is not an exception.

Who’s to blame for bad software? It’s all complicated and many factors are intertwined – there’s business requirements, there’s organizational context, there’s lack of sufficient skilled developers, there’s the inherent complexity of software development, there’s leaky abstractions, reliance on 3rd party software, consequences of wrong business and purchase decisions, time limitations, flawed business analysis, etc. So yes, despite the catchy title, I’m aware it’s actually complicated.

But in every “it’s complicated” scenario, there’s always one or two factors that are decisive. All of them contribute somehow, but the major drivers are usually a handful of things. And in the case of base software, I think it’s the fault of technical people. Developers, architects, ops.

We don’t seem to care about best practices. And I’ll do some nasty generalizations here, but bear with me. We can spend hours arguing about tabs vs spaces, curly bracket on new line, git merge vs rebase, which IDE is better, which framework is better and other largely irrelevant stuff. But we tend to ignore the important aspects that span beyond the code itself. The context in which the code lives, the non-functional requirements – robustness, security, resilience, etc.

We don’t seem to get security. Even trivial stuff such as user authentication is almost always implemented wrong. These days Twitter and GitHub realized they have been logging plain-text passwords, for example, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Too often we ignore the security implications.

Hi, brilliant blog post. I also use Quidco and have for years. I have looked at sites which are totally free cash back (Quidco charge £5 per year if you use it) but Quidco always came out on top for the same deals with better cash back and more cash back offers than the others. So thanks for spreading the word and helping people make money when they must spend money.

I always check Quidco before making an online purchase, I've just had a look and since I signed up in 2008 I've had payouts of £778! (Lots of big payouts for phone contracts and insurance). The only drawback is that payments are not guaranteed, I had cashback due from shopping at CD-Wow but they stopped doing business with Quidco so I never got my money, but on the whole it's definitely worth doing.

That's where the majority of my payouts have come from – insurance policies taken out for a cheaper price anyway with the cashback on top. I knew they weren't always guaranteed but I thought they would be if you made your purchase when the merchant was part of the program – that doesn't seem too fair at all x

2.2. Assessment of Disease Severity, Frailty and Muscle Quality {#sec2dot2-ijerph-16-03667}
---------------------------------------------------------------

The clinician assessed the PD patients with the UPDRS via clinical observation and interview regarding multiple aspects of PD, including mental dysfunction and four parts of the UPDRS. The modified H&Y scale was used to evaluate the severity of PD according to clinical findings and functional disability. The S&E ADL Scale was used to assess relative independence.

We used the modified Cardiovascular Health Study Phenotypic Classification of Frailty (CHS_PCF) and the Taiwan International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) to evaluate the study participants in terms of the five components of frailty \[[@B15-ijerph-16-03667]\] because it has been validated in Taiwanese populations. These components of frailty included unintentional weight loss, low energy and exhaustion, low physical activity, slowed walking speed, and low grip strength. A hand dynamometer was used to assess the average grip strength values of the bilateral hands over three measurements, with the threshold value for low grip strength being based on BMI and gender. The definition of frail was met if the patient had scores on the lesion-side of the threshold values for more than three components. The muscle quality is typically defined as muscle strength \[[@B16-ijerph-16-03667]\], which was measured by the walking speed and grip strength as the frailty assessment in this study.

2.3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Data Acquisition {#sec2dot3-ijerph-16-03667}

Magnetic resonance scanning was performed on a 1.5T MRI system (Discovery 450, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis, United States). A body coil was used for signal excitation and a 12-channel body phased-array coil was used for signal reception.

721,20,27404,"Ordinary removable dentures, dental plates, and the like, comprise teeth mounted in a suitable plate or base. Dentures function as a substitute for missing teeth and serve as a replacement for all or a portion of the teeth ordinarily found in the oral cavity. Although dentures generally are skillfully prepared, often they do not fit perfectly. Moreover, no matter how satisfactory at first, after a period of time the fit of the denture becomes loose and imperfect due to natural shrinkage and changes in the gums, mucous tissues, and the like. Loose and imperfectly fitted dentures usually are corrected and stabilized by the use of a denture stabilizer. Denture stabilizers are used to fill the interstices between the dentures and the gums or tissues. Prior to placement of the denture in the oral cavity, a denture stabilizer is applied to the denture-plate surface which, for a perfect fit, should uniformly contact the gums and mucous tissues. The denture stabilizer is formulated not only for its adherent properties, but also to provide a cushion or gasket between the denture and the gums or tissues, thereby positioning the denture securely in the oral cavity.
Requirements and characteristics for a satisfactory denture stabilizing composition are many and are dictated by numerous factors. Desirably, one daily application of such a composition should function as an effective means for insulating, cushioning, and securely positioning the denture. The composition should retain its characteristics and properties in the typical powder and cream forms during storage under various climatic conditions such as high temperature and humidity; be readily and easily capable of application to the denture surface; not be irritating or uncomfortable to the user; be safe and nontoxic; have no disagreeable odor or color; have no unpalatable taste; optionally provide antiseptic and germicidal properties for preventing or inhibiting the growth of organisms ordinarily found in the mouth; and function as an agent for prevention of putrefaction or malodorous decomposition of foods or secretions lodging beneath or adjacent to the denture. The stabilizing material must be capable of imbibing water and saliva and swelling, so as to fill the interstices between the denture and the gum or mucous tissues. The stabilizer should not attack or damage the denture, as by causing a crazing of the denture-plate material. Additionally, the stabilizer should be stable to bacteria, molds and enzyme systems found in the oral cavity, and have a pH that is nonirritating to the oral mucosa, generally 5-8.5, preferably a pH around neutrality. The mechanical strength of the stabilizing mass, be it gel or colloid, formed by imbibition of water should be great enough to securely maintain the position of the denture under normal use, and not so great as to make denture removal difficult when desired, or as to damage or injure the gums, tissues or denture upon removal.
There has been a considerable effort made over many years to develop improved denture adhesives. Both synthetic and natural polymers and gums have been used singly, in combination, and in combination with various additives.

Sharpest views of Betelgeuse reveal how supergiant stars lose mass

Unveiling the true face of a behemoth

of some herbs that may encourage Uterine Fibroid Tumors ( Myomas ).

by Elizabeth Smith, M.D.

Plants produce chemicals that mimic
estrogen and/or block estrogen, and/or block progesterone. The human body has receptors to both estrogen and progesterone.
These receptors will respond not only to the body's hormones, but also plant hormones. In general, phytoestrogens
are thought to wash out of the body within several days in contrast to months or decades that the synthetic chemical
xenoestrogens take to be excreted. Whole grains, fruits, seeds, beans and herbs all are know to have estrogen and/or
progesterone activity. The most famous is soy. In general, any food that has been eaten by a culture or people
group for centuries is probably all right to eat if the people group in question is relatively free from these
estrogen related diseases. When referring to phytoestrogens, it is generally thought that a ""weak"" estrogen
may actually be protective against cancer causing xenoestrogens. The best example is Lilian Thompson PhD's work
that showed that oral ground flax seed reduced breast cancer size between the time of diagnosis and surgery. The
phytoestrogen contained in the flax seed binds to the estrogen receptor, but does not stimulate it. The flax seed
phytoestrogen competes with other estrogens that would otherwise stimulate the estrogen receptor. The flax seed
phytoestrogen acts as a blocker. In one patient taking 1 oz of ground flax seed daily I have seen heavy constant bleeding.
This particular patient became anemic and a candidate for hysterectomy. Abnormal heavy bleeding stopped
after groud flax seed was stopped.

In contrast, a strong phytoestrogen may actually make the disease worse. Again
the list that follows is incomplete because of the lack of research money and interest:

In the 1940's, the sheep farmers of Perth in
western Australia began to experience an epidemic of
still births despite three seasons of exceptionally good weather. The handsome merino sheep looked healthy. However,
the ewe's failed to go into labor; the lambs died in still birth and often the mothers as well. In a matter of
5 years, the ewes failed to conceive at all even after repeated breeding with fertile rams.

Federal and agricultural specialists found
the problem. Clover. Fifteen years earlier, ranchers had imported a clover from the Mediterranean region in Europe.
The first scientific paper on this phenomenon appeared in the Australian Veterinary Journal in 1946 and proclaimed
this as ""clover disease"". Three years later three chemicals were identified as suspects. Finally, formononetin
only one of the chemicals was determined to be the culprit. Formononetin mimics estrogen.

Sunflower Seeds

Coumestrol found in sunflower seeds when fed
to the mother rat caused permanent reproductive problems in the rat pups: female pups when grown did not ovulate,
and the male pups had altered mounting behavior and fewer ejaculations. Neonatal rats and immature rats exposed
to coumestrol had premature estrous cycles. Flax seed oil and Soy oil are known NOT have the active phytoestrogens.
Sunflower oil MAY or MAY NOT have active hormone components in it.

Queen Anne's lace (wild carrot)

During the fourth century B.C., Hippocrates
noted that Queen Anne's Lace prevented pregnancies.

Pomegranate

The Greeks used this plant as a contraceptive.
Modern research confirms strong estrogen activity.

Fennel

Used in the ancient world to prevent pregnancy

Licorice, Red Clover, Yucca, Hops (Beer)

Zava, Ph.D. showed that these herbs stimulated estrogen receptor positive breast
cancer cells to grow. Red Clover and Yucca were found to be equal in potency to estradiol at the same concentrations.
Women who harvest hops for beer begin menstruating 2 days later anecdotally. Zava has confirmed that beer has a
significant amount of phytoestrogens that have moderate estrogen activity from hops used in the flavoring of beer.

Hence, when increasing $\Phi$, increasingly longer polymer chains are needed to ensure the semidilute condition $c_m \ll 1$. If $c_m$ is not small, one enters the concentrated or melt regime. From this discussion it appears that very long polymers are necessary to obtain a genuine semidilute regime over several orders of magnitude in chain density. For this reason, simulations of semidilute solutions of linear chains, even at the level of generic lattice or bead-spring models with implicit solvent, are quite expensive and have been limited to not too long chains and not too high densities. [@Muller:2000p2000; @Cavallo:2006p784; @Bolhuis:2001p268; @Louis:2002Physica; @Yan:2000p2257; @Pelissetto:2005p296] Moreover, in many complex situations, polymers only constitute one species in the solution, making full-monomer simulations even more difficult. In these cases a modelling at length scales of the order of the polymer size is often sufficient to provide the relevant thermodynamic and structural informations on the solution. For instance, to determine the phase behavior of polymer-colloid mixtures in the colloid regime, [@PoonWCK:2002p1993; @Fuchs:2002p2258; @Tuinier:2003p2259; @Mutch:2006p2260] a detailed microscopic model of the polymers is not necessary. It is enough to use coarse-grained models which retain the essential thermodynamic (long-wavelength) behavior of the polymer solution.[@Bolhuis:2002p267] Other examples are block copolymers for which the self-assembling of the chains in supramolecular aggregates of various shapes and sizes is ubiquitous. The description of the physical behavior of the self-assembled phases only requires a modelling at the mesoscopic level rather than at the microscopic (monomer) level. [@Pierleoni:2006p159; @HansenJP:2006p2248; @SG-07; @GP-10] This is the realm of self-consistent field-theoretical methods which have proved to be very effective to describe the physics of concentrated solutions and melts of homopolymers and block-copolymer blends. [@Bates:1990p759; @Cavallo:2006p784]

Coarse-grained models for soft condensed matter systems have received much attention in the last two decades.[@Likos:2001p277] In the simplest approach one maps polymer chains onto point particles interacting by means of the pairwise potential of mean force between the centers of mass of two isolated polymers. [@Dijkstra:1999p2142; @Likos:2001p277] This potential is of the order of $2k_BT$ at full overlap,[@Grosberg:1982p2265; @Dautenhahn:1994p2250] has a limited range of the order of $3 R_g$ and is very well represented by a linear combination of few Gaussian functions. [@Bolhuis:2001p268; @Pelissetto:2005p296] Such a model is however limited to the dilute regime $\Phi\lesssim 1$, in which many-body interactions[@Bolhuis:2001p288] can be neglected.

Do you include pensions in your net worth? How about art, insurance, homes, cats, baseball cards?

These are some of the most popular questions I get asked, outside of “Is J. Money your real name?” (Yes) and “how did you get so damn sexy??” (I don’t know, it just comes natural! ;))

So today I thought I’d list out my personal feelings on it, and then everyone can chime in and let me know if they think I’m a big fat idiot or not. Although the reality is that we’d all be wrong, because:

THERE IS NO WRONG WAY TO TRACK IT!

Okay, well there is – you can’t call cash a “debt” or a loan an “asset” – but everyone here is smart enough to not mess that up, so what we’re really talking about here are all those *gray areas* that come into play. The stuff that might or might not belong in your wealth, but you just can’t tell and want an extra set of eyes on it.

So today, I’ll be your eyes :) And then you can take what you want from it…

3.2. Research Process and Sample {#sec3dot2-ijerph-17-03446}
--------------------------------

Five researchers went to each of the six mine sites to distribute and collect the questionnaire. Workers completed the questionnaire individually prior to their shift. Researchers were present to assist those with low literacy skills. Managers were not present when workers completed the survey. Participants who completed the questionnaire online were recruited by distributing the web address electronically through a professional website. The procedures of this study were approved by the University of China University of Mining and Technology.

Participants were 642 Chinese coal mining workers, all of whom were male. Their demographic details are given (see [Appendix A](#app1-ijerph-17-03446){ref-type=""app""}, [Table A1](#ijerph-17-03446-t0A1){ref-type=""table""}). A total of 786 workers were given questionnaires, making an effective recovery rate of 84.5%. Nearly all of the participants (92%) were frontline workers from six underground mining companies operating in the northeastern (Mine A and Mine B), central (Mine C and Mine D), southeastern (Mine E), and western regions (Mine F) of China. Mining companies were run by Chinese provincial governments or the national government. Considering the reality of the numbers of coal mine companies distributed in the northeastern, central, and southeastern regions account for 93.23% of all Chinese companies \[[@B38-ijerph-17-03446]\], the sample was mostly in three regions. The number of participants and effective respondents in Mines A, B, C, D, E, F were 170/135, 140/109, 120/100, 110/92, 114/94, 70/50, respectively. The remaining participants were employed at coal mines across China who completed the questionnaire online, and the number of participants and effective respondents was 62/62.

3.3. Reliability and Validity Analysis {#sec3dot3-ijerph-17-03446}

The presence of prosopagnosia -- that is, the inability to reliably recognise facial identity -- was determined using two tests of face memory and one of face perception. As can be seen in [Fig. 3](#fig0015){ref-type=""fig""}, the individuals in the prosopagnosic group performed poorly on these tests, and performed at least two standard deviations (SDs) below control norms on one or more tests. The *MACCS Famous Face Test 2008* (MFFT-08) assesses memory for famous faces that have generally been repeatedly seen over relatively long time periods (Palermo, Rivolta, Wilson, & Jeffery, in preparation). It contains 20 people famous to Australians and 20 that are not. On each trial: (a) a *face* is presented and participants judge whether it is familiar or not, (b) for the famous faces, they are asked to identify the *face* by providing its name or other specific autobiographical information, then (c) the famous person\'s *name* and relevant autobiographical information are presented, and participants report whether the famous *person* was actually known to them (any that are unknown are excluded from further analyses). The score on the MFFT-08 is the percentage of correctly recognised *faces* of *known* famous people. A sample of 39 control participants (26 females) aged between 19 and 72 years (*M* = 45.69, *SD* = 16.08) correctly recognised 74.17% (*SD* = 19.09) of known faces (Palermo et al., in preparation). Age-appropriate *z*-scores based on these control data were calculated for each prosopagnosic and vary from −0.95 to −4.39 (see [Fig. 3](#fig0015){ref-type=""fig""}).

The *Cambridge Face Memory Test* (CFMT, [@bib0070]) assesses face learning and memory. Participants learn six individuals (each from three different viewpoints), and then recognize the previously seen faces when shown in novel views and/or degraded by noise. Total scores on the upright CFMT were transformed to age-adjusted *z*-scores (using age-based norms reported in [@bib0035]), with the prosopagnosics scoring between −1.39 and −2.83 below the Australian sample ([Fig. 3](#fig0015){ref-type=""fig""}).[2](#fn"

It is said that imitation is flattery. It is the nature of creation. Art inspires art, music inspires music, and so forth. In the film industry directorial styles have inspired new film makers for decades. Each year new movies debut with reminiscent qualities from by gone eras. Imitation is a common hobby among fanatics of large franchises films and TV series. Star Wars, Star Trek and the Marvel and DC universe have all inspired cosplay performance art. Yet a fan made film is on a completely different level. It's an obsessive beast that knows no rival. Most are short, with a handful of stand outs. They are passion projects, made with small budgets, and some with no money at all. They are made by those whose fan level are extreme. It is the ultimate street cred. “I could make a better film,” many fans argue while walking out of a movie theater after the latest money grab franchise disappointment. And some do. That is the heart of a fan film. They can not be made for profit. All thoughts of money are removed from the creative development. The ultimate clean slate. No executive producer meddling. No budget cuts. Just an idea, and the rabid passion to make it a reality.





The stories of Tolkien lore span several millenniums. Much of these tales were hinted at in the Lord of the Rings appendices. The success of Peter Jackson’s Rings trilogy put a spot light on the fantasy novels. Previously only an animated feature, Jackson shot all three films at once in a span of 18 months, and released them in three consecutive years. Many of the vast stories from Tolkien’s history are mentioned in passing, and made for great additions on the extended home release.

Reporters need to stop covering him as if he’s strictly a political one

Credit: JIM WATSON / Contributor/Getty Images

In the 818 days since the 2016 election, the Washington Post has used the word “unprecedented” in reference to President Donald Trump, or his associates, about 657 times­ — or almost every day. On just one day in January, for example, readers learned of Trump’s “unprecedented steps” to slow immigration, his “unprecedented decision” to hold onto his business in the White House, and his “unprecedented assault” on the census.

There is a breathlessness to the coverage that, oddly, does not diminish with time. The word “remarkable” appears almost as often in the Post, averaging every other day since 2016. We read about the “remarkable rift” between the President and his former National Security Adviser (Dec. 1, 2017), Trump’s “remarkable ignorance of U.S. history” (July 19, 2018), and his “remarkable tweetstorm” against his former lawyer (Dec. 4, 2018).

If something happens that often, it can’t be all that remarkable. Why do journalists keep using these words? Simple. Because any time news breaks, we call political scientists, pollsters, former White House staffers, and opponents for analysis, little of which is remotely illuminating. The problem is, we try to cover Trump as a political matter. And by doing so, we’re potentially missing a big part of the story.

Imagine if Trump had a seizure during a press conference. Would reporters ring up the folks at Brookings and the Cato Institute for comment? Would we analyze new polling data to help us understand if there is a clever political strategy behind his behavior?

“His behavior is not remarkable. It’s predictable. It’s exactly what we’d expect. He just continues to be a consistent version of who he appears to be.”

No. We’d call physicians, who would tell us that they can’t formally diagnose the president without seeing him, but they can say that a seizure is generally caused by an uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. They could then explain that a seizure might be caused by epilepsy — and what might happen if epilepsy goes untreated. This context would not be inappropriate or biased; it would demystify the president’s behavior and help us prepare for what comes next, with significantly less drama and noise.

So, I tried an experiment the other day. To make sense of Trump’s behavior, I did not call foreign policy experts or pundits. That would be like calling an astrologer to explain a flu pandemic. Instead, I called Wendy Behary, who wrote the book Disarming the Narcissist and has treated hundreds of narcissistic clients, including surgeons, Wall Street executives, and other powerful people, in her private practice in New Jersey. It was one of the most useful conversations I’ve had about Trump in months.

Unlike the Washington Post or the New York Times, Behary has never once been surprised by Trump’s behavior. “His behavior is not remarkable. It’s predictable. It’s exactly what we’d expect,” she says. “He just continues to be a consistent version of who he appears to be.”

{food, health} Trying to Make Changes

I've had a lot of conversations with people lately about eating healthier. I may need to explain my definition of healthy eating. I don't mean calorie counting, nor do I mean counting fat grams. I do think these are important for someone who is in the very beginning of a healthy eating journey because it helps a person understand what they are putting into their body on a basic level.

However, I also believe we have been conditioned to think that fat and high calorie counts in our diet are automatically bad for us because we have a problem with obesity in our country. I think the problem is not necessarily only the fats and calories; Our bodies need fats, but healthy fats, and in moderation in a balanced diet. I think this problem is from a lack of education about what eating healthy really means. This need is trying to be filled, not by people eating more vegetables and local, fresh foods, but by buying pre-packaged, processed foods claiming ""low calorie"" or ""low fat"" that may have some nutritional value, but are not the best for our bodies. The problem is, especially in our country, we always want bigger, faster, more convenient, and I think our bodies are paying for it.

Eggs from free range, grain fed chickens

My explanation of eating healthy is cutting out processed foods, chemicals, and preservatives, while incorporating as much fresh, local food in my diet as possible. Mostly vegetables, but also meat from local farms, while not requiring meat as a necessity for every meal. Also, eating when we are hungry, and not only because it is ""meal-time"", and being aware of my portion size. (I cannot tell you how many times I've eaten an entire meal when I wasn't really hungry, simply because it was ""supper time"") Most of my friends hold these same views, so i've been getting a lot of advice and information from people who are keeping these habits.

Tiny tomatoes from my garden

We have begun our ""healthy eating journey"" with trying to cut out so much meat from our diets. We aren't going completely vegetarian ( I mean, come on-- my favorite meal in the world is good, grilled ribeye steak and mashed potatoes. Simple, I know. But how can I give that up?! maybe in time, but not yet :)), but we felt we needed to make some healthier choices. Not to mention the price of buying healthy meat (when I say healthy i mean organic, no hormones, no antibiotics, etc) is at least twice the price of other meats. I found myself slipping on my convictions about healthy meats because I couldn't afford to buy the kind. I would leave the grocery store so upset because I wasn't able to feed my family (small as it is) what I felt is best for us, all because it is just priced too high. I find that in some stores I am forced to buy things that I don't want to buy, only because the healthier option is priced too high. So, the solution? Take the need away. Replace those things with healthy options that will be more nutritious, and just as delicious!

I'm realizing that there are so many things that I have as a staple in my pantry that are not healthy for us. Cutting processed foods from our diet is the next step. When we are more conscious of what we eat, we will begin to notice things here and there and wonder why in the world we continue to use them. There are healthier alternatives. Most of the things that I use that are processed are simply for convenience sake. Why do I feel like I NEED cream of mushroom soup and Minute Rice?! If I just take the time to make these things, they are much better tasting, and much"
750,27,2664,"1. Field of the Invention
The invention relates generally to electronic circuitry. More specifically, the invention relates a method for reducing the noise associated with a clock signal for a latch based circuit.
2. Background Art
In all microprocessor-based systems, including, the clock circuit is a critical component. The clock circuit generates a clock signal that is a steady stream of timing pulses that synchronize and control the timing of every operation of the system. FIG. 1 shows a prior art diagram of an ideal clock signal 10. An entire clock cycle 12 includes a rising or leading edge 14 and a falling or trailing edge 16. These edges 14, 16 define the transition between the low phase and high phase of the signal.
FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a prior art local clock signal distribution system. The clock signal 30a is input to a clock header 32 which serves to buffer the clock signal. From the header 32, the clock signal 30b is input to an edge-triggered latch 34 where it serves to trigger the latch. A latch is a memory device that is commonly used in integrated circuits. It is dependent upon a clock signal to initiate its function. Latches take input data and distribute output data during the entire clock high phase. Most data tends to be waiting at the latch by the time the clock pulses high, therefore most latches switch on the rising edge of the clock. Latches are also made to work on the clock low phase and consequently tend to switch on the falling edge of the clock. Both types of latches are commonly used in order make use of both phases of the clock for computation.
FIG. 3 shows a digital logic schematic of the prior art local clock signal distribution system as shown in FIG. 2. The clock signal 30a is input to the clock header 32. The clock header 32 includes a NAND gate 36 and an inverter 38a. Once inside the clock header 32, the clock signal 30a is one of the inputs to the NAND gate 36. The other NAND input 42 is a signal that is HIGH so that the gate 36 simply inverts the value of the clock signal 30a. This NAND input 42 is switched to LOW to turn off the clock header 32 if needed. Next, the signal 30a passes through the inverter 38a which inverts the signal back to its original value. The clock signal 30b then passes from the clock header 32 to the latch 34. Once in the latch 34, the signal 30b is split into two paths. The first path passes through one inverter 38b, and the second path passes through two consecutive inverters 38c and 38d. Each path feeds into separate control transistors 40a and 40b that control the DATA_IN 44 and DATA_OUT 46 paths of the latch 34.

This picture of the world looks like a big grapefruit. What do the lines running up and down and side to side on the map represent?

What are latitude and longitude?

The entire world is covered with invisible lines, called ""lines of latitude and longitude."" These invisible lines were invented thousands of years ago by ancient cultures. The lines were used to help people figure out where they were.

The lines that run up and down on a map are called ""lines of longitude."" You can remember that longitude lines go up and down because longitude starts with the word “long.” Since longitude lines go up and down, they appear to be longer.

Lines that run from side to side are called ""lines of latitude."" You can remember latitude lines go from side to side by remembering the phrase “lat is fat.” Latitude lines are like the belt of the earth, going around from side to side.

How do you read lines of longitude?

Longitude lines tell how far a place is located from east to west. They are spaced the farthest apart at the equator, and all the lines meet at the poles, on the opposite ends of the earth.

Both lines of latitude and longitude are read using degrees (°). The 0° longitude line runs through Greenwich, England. This line is referred to as the ""prime meridian."" Put your finger on the 0° line on the map below. What major city is the line close to? Tell your teacher or parent.

In both directions, east and west, the number of degrees grows. The farther away you get from Greenwich, England, the greater the longitude. Notice how the lines on both sides of 0° say 5°? 5° to the left of the prime meridian is 5° W, and 5° to the right of the prime meridian is 5° E. Lines of longitude go up to 180° in both directions. This is because if you add both halves together, you get 360°. 360° is always the distance around a circle or sphere.

To read longitude lines, put your finger on the location. Then, run your finger up or down to find the degrees longitude. If the location is west of the prime meridian, make sure to say it is degrees west. If the location is east of the prime meridian, make sure to say it is degrees east. Find Florence, which is located in Italy.

What is the longitude of Florence?

Tell your teacher or parent.

You probably noticed that Florence does not line up exactly with one of the longitude lines. It is a little to the right of 10°. Therefore, we can estimate that Florence has a longitude of about 12° E.

How do you read lines of latitude?

Latitude tells us how far a place is located from north to south. The 0° latitude line is the equator. The farther north or south you go, the greater the line of latitude. To read latitude lines, put your finger on the location. Then, run your finger right or left to find the degrees latitude. If the location is above the equator, make sure to say it is degrees north. If the location is below the equator, make sure to say it is degrees south. Find Florence again on the map.

What is the latitude of Florence?

Tell your teacher or parent.

By Dodd, Mead & Company [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons

Once again, Florence does not line up exactly with a line of latitude. Therefore, you can estimate Florence has a latitude of about 44° N. Now, put the longitude and latitude of Florence together to find its exact location.

You should have said Florence’s exact location is about 44° N, 12° E. Traditionally, when writing latitude and longitude, latitude is always written first. The numbers should be separated with a comma. When latitude and longitude are written together, they are called ""coordinates.'

Now that you have learned a little about latitude and longitude, discuss with your teacher"

“He just told me to breathe and breathe,” Lilly recalls.

Another teen who had learned from her own experience advised her to lie on her side on her bed and breathe until she calmed down.

“What if she wasn’t there?” Lilly wonders. “What would have happened to me if that girl wasn’t there.”

When a fight erupted between two of the girls, the staff sounded a “Code Black.” Backup soon arrived.

“One big guy,” Lilly recalls. “He’s about six-eight, over 300 pounds. He just grabs a girl, body-slammed her face-first on the floor. I don’t know how her neck didn’t break. They gave her ice. Ice, that’s it.”

Lilly poses the question, “Why would I feel safe in there?”

When she met with her case worker, it was in a nice room apart from where she and the other children were confined.

“I wanted her to walk where I walk, I wanted her to see what I see, I wanted her to feel what I feel,” Lilly says.

The longer-term residents who were favored by the staff sometimes sought to order Lilly to do this or that. She would refuse and the staff would give her food to the favored girl.

“So I started not trusting staff,” Lilly remembers. “I was so lonely to myself. I was depressed.”

She adds, “I didn’t feel like I had anybody.”

One staffer did offer to straighten her hair, and Lilly briefly hoped she might have somebody after all. The staffer then burned Lilly’s neck with the flat iron.

“She burned me intentionally,” Lilly alleges. “I told her, ‘You burned me.’ She"

Upon this point there is considerable conflict of testimony. Prior to 1884 the only trade-mark in use by the Medical Company was that of a man falling in a fit, and this it is admitted passed to the assignee, and is now the property of the plaintiff. There is no doubt that Dr. Richmond, in November or December, 1883, while acting as president and manager of the company, devised the trade-mark in question, and made all the necessary arrangements for the intended change in the size of the bottle and in the trade-mark; that advertisements were put into circulars notifying the trade that the change would take place on the first of May, 1884: that the *301 bills for engraving this trade-mark were all paid for by the company and charged, not to Dr. Richmond personally, but to the expense account of the company; that the circulars announcing the proposed change were printed and circulated in January and February of that year, under the supervision of Dr. Richmond; that these circulars contained a fac-simile of the cartoon or caddy as it would appear, together with a notice warning the public that none would be genuine unless thus encased, and bearing the following inscription: ""Have Dr. Richmond's picture blown in the bottle, his picture to be printed on two sides of the caddy or cartoon, and the bottle enlarged;"" that orders were placed for the new style of bottle with a Pittsburg firm, and were paid for by the company on delivery. Some of these bottles were received about the first of May, while Dr. Richmond continued to be superintendent of the company, and a memorandum of their payment appears upon the cash book of the company. There was also an order placed for cartoons to be used after May 1 for wrapping or encasing the nervine preparation, which were also paid for by the company. These cartoons contained the words: ""Put up or prepared by the Dr. S.A. Richmond Medical Company."" After Dr. Richmond left St. Joseph and went to Chicago, the words ""Prepared by the Dr. S.A.

What makes a certain makers heat treat better than anothers?

I don't know where to post this, but this seems the right place. I have heard several people say ""_____'s heat treat on AEB-L is the best there is."" and ""____'s heat treat has gotten a lot better since he first started."" So I am wondering what makes certain heat treatments better than others. I guess what I am asking is if I hand you two pieces of 52100 that have been heat treated to 61hrc by 2 different makers and another that has been heat treated to 61hrc by a professional heat treatment company what are the differences and why is one better than the other even though they are the same hrc?

I will expose whatever combination of knowledge and ignorance I have on this topic to hope I dispell some erroneous ideas I have...

I think that for a given HRC, the differences are about toughness vs chippiness. VG10 seems to be a good example of this....in the wrong hands (Shun seems to be blamed for this a lot) it's very chippy, but in good hands, it can be a great steel.

Also, I think limiting the discussion to a given HRC might be useful for discussion purposes, but different makers will choose different HRC's as part of the overall balance they are trying to achieve.

There is a window of time when transformation from austenite to martensite happens (hardening), and that window is quite short (2-3 minutes). In other words, if one works with small batches, one can get blanks quicker from one step of HT to another and that can result in more transformation from austenites to martesites (hardness, more uniform grain structure, etc). Resilient burr, wire edge, often are the symptoms of retained austenites (those that didn't convert to martensites).

If one optimizes steps in HT process, picks the right temperatures from which to quench and at which to temper, one should get a well rounded knife that would sharpen easily, take a keen edge and hold it without rolling or chipping, and retain sharpness for a long time. In case of 52100, if you manage to refine grain, quench at the right temperature, temper at a right temperature, cryo treatment, of course, you get a very fine structure of the steel that feature all of the above qualities and responds very well to stropping on diamond. This will prolong time between sharpening sessions for months - a good thing for pro users, I was told.

""All beauty that has no foundation in use, soon grows distasteful and needs continuous replacement with something new."" The Shakers' saying.

Also, I think limiting the discussion to a given HRC might be useful for discussion purposes, but different makers will choose different HRC's as part of the overall balance they are trying to achieve.

I was limiting the discussion. I guess I was asking about the differences between this sample of 52100 at 61hrc and another sample at the same hardness made by a different maker.

755,1,9617,"El próximo 28 de mayo, Google podrí­a presentar la nueva versión de su plataforma móvil: Android 6.0. Hasta el momento conocemos pocos detalles, alguna que otra caracterí­stica, aunque no ha habido ninguna captura hasta el momento que nos muestre como será su diseño. Android Police nos ha desvelado parte de este misterio, filtrando algunas imágenes que corresponderí­an a la nueva aplicación para fotografí­as, que pasa a llamarse sencillamente Fotos.

La nueva aplicación seguirá manteniendo parte de las caracterí­sticas que se encuentran actualmente en otras versiones de Android, como Lollipop. De este modo, se podrán seguir realizando copias de seguridad de las imágenes a la nube, aunque ya no tendrá que ser exclusivamente a Google Drive. Por su parte, la nueva aplicación incluirá una nueva función llamada Asistente, que nos permitirá editar nuestros álbumes para crear todo tipo de opciones interesantes, como cuentos o pelí­culas.

Pero, lo realmente destacable, es que cambiará el modo en el que organizamos las fotografí­as. En esto, Android se ha fijado mucho en Apple y la aplicación nos permitirá visualizar las imágenes en miniatura, organizadas por dí­as o meses. También tendremos la posibilidad de añadir etiquetas automáticamente, seleccionar múltiples imágenes, o encontrar personas y demás elementos realizando una simple búsqueda. Básicamente, podremos escribir “nubes” y la aplicación encontrará entre las fotos aquellas en las que aparezca esta caracterí­stica.

En su afán por “capturar” usuarios de otras plataformas, Google permitirí­a que su nueva aplicación Fotos también pueda usarse en iOS. Esto va a ser especialmente interesante para todos aquellos clientes de los dispositivos Apple que quieran usar otros servicios además de iCloud o el programa de fotografí­a de la firma californiana. Además, Google habrí­a añadido en esta nueva aplicación una manera nueva de compartir con otros contactos ví­deos o fotografí­as. Podrán hacerlo mediante enlaces, lo que dará más privacidad, ya que se permitirá eliminar la geolocalización.

The bottom layer was first coated on a clean silicon substrate by spin casting 11 wt % PMMA in anisole solvent at 1500 rpm for 5 min, resulting in a thickness of approximately 3.5 µm. Then, a 300 nm thick Au film was sputtered on the PMMA substrate by using magnetron sputtering. The Au film was subsequently patterned by focused ion beam (FIB) milling (FEI, Helios NanoLab 650). In FIB processing, the ion acceleration voltage and the beam current were 30 kV and 2.5 nA, respectively. The effective area of the circuit pattern was 55 × 55 µm. Finally, samples having different top layer thicknesses were obtained by spinning a more diluted PMMA solution (2--6%) with a speed ranging from 1000 to 6000 rpm. The resulting cover thicknesses were 52, 117, 185, 380, and 653 nm as measured by AFM. Furthermore, the top surface was smoothed to eliminate the cross-talk of surface topography in subsurface CR-AFM imaging.

thesteamship, which lies rusting in
Ensenada. Thevesselcarried millions between the island and San Pedro.By DIANA MARCUM, Special to The Times

Most everyone familiar with the story of the steamship Catalina agrees it's a classic seafaring tale, full of the romance and pathos of a ship far from home.

Where people disagree is on what would make a happy ending. For decades a familiar sight plying the waters between Santa Catalina Island and San Pedro, the historic ship has been rusting in the muddy Ensenada harbor since 1997.

A group trying to rescue the ship took a key step forward Monday, when the Mexican navy released the Catalina for salvage efforts. A June 9 letter signed by President Ernesto Zedillo gives the SS Catalina Preservation Assn. 90 days to get the 300-foot ship out of the water.

If organizers of the rescue effort can raise the partly submerged vessel, chase out the stingrays and sharks, and make it the quarter-mile to an Ensenada dry dock, then the real questions begin: Can California's last steamship, a state historical landmark and Los Angeles cultural monument, be restored, and can a permanent home for it be found? Or should it be towed out and given a simple burial at sea?

Among those hoping to see the boat restored is naval architect Ron Holder, president of the preservation association. He concedes that the ship may be too far gone--and that $40,000 in contributions may only salvage scrap metal. But his dream is that the Catalina can be reclaimed.

""If there's one thing I'd love to hear again it's that deep-throated whistle,"" said Holder, a Laguna Niguel resident who remembers childhood trips on the ship with his grandfather.
But many longtime Catalina residents oppose the resurrection, calling it a sacrilege.

""It's like digging up grandma and putting her at the head of the table,"" said Chuck Liddell, an Avalon resident who grew up on the island. ""Most islanders feel that strongly. The Catalina is in our memories and that's where she should stay.""

Liddell said he ""literally felt ill"" at the sight"

Tar ikke hensyn til lovlighet

Før ungdommene mistet lappen, fikk de et forhåndsvarsel fra Forvaltningsenheten. Deretter fikk de 14 dager på seg med å komme med informasjon de mener er relevant for saken.

— Det er mange som kommer med uttalelser. Det inngår som en del av sakens dokumenter, og blir en del av helhetsvurderingen, sier Fürstenberg, som igjen understreker at det gjøres en skjønnsmessig vurdering i hvert tilfelle, og at hun uttaler seg på generelt grunnlag.

Forvaltningsenheten tar ikke hensyn til lovligheten av rusmiddelet som benyttes, når det gjelder vurderingen av edruelighet.

— Vi ser på en konkret helhetsvurdering av ruseffekten, sier Fürstenberg.

Alkohol = narkotika

I prinsippet kan dermed alkoholbruk og narkotikabruk dermed behandles likt med tanke på om man får beholde førerkortet.

— Det vi må vurdere er om bruken tilsier en økt risiko i trafikken.

For å få sertifikatet tilbake, må ungdommene vise til dokumentert rusfrihet i ett år.

— Det blir en konkret vurdering i hvert tilfelle, men de må sannsynliggjøre edruelighet. Det er opp til personen selv og skaffe bevis for dette, gjerne fra lege, sier hun.

Økning i førerkortbeslag

Fra 1. januar til 5. august i år, har politiet i Hordaland fattet 644 vedtak om tilbakekallelse av førerretten.

550 av disse vedtakene kommer som følge av vedtak fattet av fylkesmannen, mens 94 av dem er på bakgrunn av saker politiet selv har initiert.

Samme periode i fjor, var det totalt 578 vedtak, og bare 34 av dem kom på bakgrunn av saker politiet selv initierte.

— Vi ser at antallet egeninitierte saker går opp etter at vi innførte den nye metodikken. Det er et mer strømlinjeformet system, som vi er glade for, sier Ane Kvaal, politiinspektør og leder for forvaltningsenheten i Hordaland-politiet.

Nytt prosjekt

Det som har skjedd i mellomtiden, er nemlig at politiet har implementert prosjektet Forebygging gjennom forvaltning. Det er i praksis en ny struktur for å fange opp meldinger fra politiets egne ansatte om personer hvor det er grunn til å tro at vedkommende ikke lenger fyller vilkårene for å inneha en tillatelse fra politiet.

Kvaal er forsiktig med å tilskrive det nye prosjektet all æren for at antallet vedtak som følge av egeninitierte saker går opp.

— Økningen kan jo skyldes at politiet har blitt flinkere til på melde fra, eller at det finnes flere personer som ikke burde"

Philosophical work

Shusterman's place in contemporary pragmatism
Contemporary pragmatism can be divided into two sub-fields; the neo-classical and the neo-analytical. The latter has been well described by Richard Rorty, as an amalgam of the elements of classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, which is sometimes supplemented, especially in Rorty's case, by the ideas of continental thinkers like Martin Heidegger. The former, represented, among others, by Susan Haack, is more conservative in its development of the classical tradition and adopts a critical stance toward Rorty's interpretation thereof.

Assuming this description is correct, Shusterman's pragmatism lies somewhere in the middle between the above-mentioned positions. Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty's ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty's thought under a common category of ""reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism"") seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress he puts on the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute with the notion of language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance.

Besides classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, Shusterman's interests touch varied traditions and disciplines: continental sociology (Pierre Bourdieu) and philosophy (Michel Foucault, Michel de Montaigne, Friedrich Nietzsche), Western body therapy (Moshe Feldenkrais, F. Matthias Alexander) as well as East-Asian thought (Confucius).

On day 4, one of the objects was replaced by a novel object and mice were allowed to explore for 5 min (Additional file [1](#MOESM1){ref-type=""media""}: Figure S1A). Trials were recorded by the overhead camera and analyzed by an automatic video tracking system (EthoVision, Noldus) for movement tracking or by manual scoring for exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior was defined as the animal directing its nose toward an object at a distance less than 2 cm. Objects were secured in the arena with magnets.

Delayed matching-to-place (DMP) dry maze test was used to measure special working memory as described by Faizi et al. \[[@CR35]\]. Briefly, we used a modified Barnes maze with 40 escape holes (*D* = 5 cm, 16 holes on the outer ring with 50-cm distance to the center, 16 holes on the middle ring with 35-cm distance to the center, and 8 holes on the inner ring with 20-cm distance to the center). All holes were uncovered with the exception of the escape hole, which is covered with a dark escape tube (a black PVC tube). The light was set to approximately 1200 lux, and a noise (2 kHz, 85 dB) was used during the test. Visual cues were placed on three sides of the maze. Mice were giving four trials each day with interval of 10 min. Mice were placed at the center of the maze under a dark box for 30 s. The trial started when the box was removed and ended when the mice found the escape hole within 90 s. Mice were guided to the escape hole by the experimenter if they could not find it within 90 s. Noise was turned off, and the escape hole was covered immediately after the mice entered. The mice were returned to their"

Changing The Water

If you set up you aquarium properly in the first place, you shouldn’t have to worry about doing any large-scale cleaning. You will, however, need to change the water in your tank on a regular basis to remove chemicals and heavy metals, replacing it with fresh, clean water. Changing the water in the fish tank is a maintenance chore that, when done correctly and often, improves the quality of living for the fish in your tank. Even with the most efficient and sophisticated filtration systems set up, nothing works better that changing the tank water.

One of the most important functions a water change serves is to remove accumulated toxins and chemicals from the tank water. If the nitrogen cycle has been properly established in your tank, there should be sufficient beneficial bacteria present to convert toxins like ammonia into less harmful substances like nitrate. There is no way to remove nitrate from the tank, however, without performing"

778,9,9295,"Bürgergemeinde

The Bürgergemeinde (also Burgergemeinde, Ortsgemeinde, Ortsbürgergemeinde, Tagwen, bourgeoisie, commune bourgeoise, vischnanca burgaisa, ) is a statutory corporation in public law in Switzerland.  It includes all individuals who are citizens of the Bürgergemeinde, usually by having inherited the Bourgeoisie (citizenship), regardless of where they were born or where they may currently live. Membership of the Bürgergemeinde of a municipality is not to be confused with holding the municipality's citizenship, which, in certain cantons such as Valais, are two distinct legal concepts.  Instead of the place of birth, Swiss legal documents, e.g. passports, contain the Heimatort (place of origin). It is, however, possible for a person to not possess bourgeoisie of the municipality from which they originate; laws relating to these matters vary depending on the canton in which the Bürgergemeinde is located. The Bürgergemeinde also often holds and administers the common property which had been bequeathed or otherwise given to the members of the bourgeoisie. The political communes or municipalities, the parish and the Bürgergemeinde often include the same area but may be separate depending on the relevant cantonal law. With the increase in mobility since the first half of the 19th century, the Bürgergemeinde and the rights associated with citizenship in the municipality have lost most of their meaning.  Today, in Switzerland there are nearly 2000 Bürgergemeinden and corporations.

Names
The Bürgergemeinde is known by different names in individual cantons.  These names include: bourgeoisie (in Valais and Fribourg), commune bourgeois in Jura, Burgergemeinde (Bern, Valais), Ortsbürgergemeinde (Uri, Aargau), Ortsgemeinde (St. Gallen, Thurgau), vischnanca burgaisa (Graubünden) or Tagwen (Glarus).  In Ticino, they are called patriziati, which emerged from the so-called vicinanze and are their legal successor.  In the cantons of Nidwalden, Schwyz, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Neuchâtel, Geneva, and Vaud there are no Bürgergemeinden with the political communes handle the associated responsibilities. In Nidwalden, Schwyz, and Appenzell Innerrhoden, however, there are privately organized corporations () that operate in much the same way.

And there is India. Barred from flying its flag at the Sochi Games because of internal corruption, it was granted a reprieve only a few days ago, allowing its athletes to avert competing independently in a gathering organized around national pride.

“The whole world is watching. And when the Indian flag doesn’t fly, people know that it’s because of corruption and it’s not a nice image for the country,” Indian luger Shiva Keshavan, a five-time Olympian, said after his country was reinstated.

“You have a lot more behind you when you go with your country’s flag,” he said.

That’s it exactly. As much as it purports to be about the individual athletes and their achievements (and it is), an Olympics is also about countries. And countries — every one of them — carry a lot of baggage, particularly in their relationships with other countries. To put their athletes upon fields of play and expect it to be about only sport is, to be blunt, naive.

At 4:10 p.m. terrorists detonated a large explosive below the terrace of the Adam Hotel (1). Seconds later, the Israelis fired an air-to-surface missile at the steel container (2). A terrorist cameraman filmed the aftermath of the missile strike from in front of the Commodore Hotel (3).

Less than five seconds after the missile strike, four boys in dark clothing were photographed running from the breakwater. They were either beneath or inside an abandoned cargo trailer at the base of the breakwater (1). Although they could have taken shelter in any one of five hotels and restaurants along the way, they chose instead to run 300 meters or 328 yards to the al-Deira Hotel (3).

As they ran, a second explosion took place behind them (2). Photos show that four boys and one adult male arrived at the al-Deira. Not a single photographer or cameraman in the hotel captured the drama on the beach, though several claimed to have witnessed it. The second explosion was a terrorist IED meant to simulate Israeli naval fire. At the hotel the adult male was immediately put into a taxi and driven away (4). The terrorist commander of the operation assisted.

Journalists and hotel staff gave first aid to two boys who were said to be injured. Photos indicate that they first bandaged the ankle of a boy they said was critically wounded in the chest by shrapnel. The other boy’s injuries were obviously inflicted before he ran to the hotel. His facial wounds did not bleed, and his severely broken arm could not have been caused by aerial munitions or falling into sand.

After putting the adult male into the taxi, the terrorist commander of the operation (1) walked down to the empty lot between the al-Andalus Wedding Hall and Restaurant and the Avenue Restaurant and Coffee Shop.

The first ambulance to arrive (2) drove into the empty lot and stopped in front of the terrorist commander. By parking so far from the breakwater, the paramedics ensured that journalists could film the recovery of the first dead child. By this time at least two dozen western and Palestinian reporters had gathered at the breakwater. They had walked past and filmed the area near the tents, where the bodies of the three other boys would later be placed. No reporter has commented on the fact that there were no corpses in the sand minutes after the Israeli missile strike.

Although the first ambulance parked in the vacant lot, a white TV truck (3) drove all the way to the breakwater. One western journalist tweeted that he found two deceased adult males in the police post, along with a dead boy. He later deleted this tweet without explanation. The TV truck was used to remove the bodies of the two men who served as sacrificial lambs in the operation.

On the breakwater the terribly mutilated body of a boy was found outside the smoldering steel container (1).

A terrorist masquerading as a TV journalist took control of the stretcher and directed the paramedics down to the beach. Surrounded by terrorist operatives and media, the paramedics took the first dead child to the ambulance (2) and departed to al-Shifa Hospital.

At this point all western journalists left the beach. None have offered an explanation for their actions.

never been easier to visit this 75-year-old colossus, which provides
20 million residents of California, Nevada, and Arizona with water and
1.3 million with hydroelectricity. Some new engineering is now helping
the flow of the near-million annual visitors: a four-lane,
1,900-foot-long Hoover Dam bypass
bridge. This bridge is the second-highest in the nation, perched at
almost 900 feet above the rushing Colorado River. Avoid the intense
summer heat (as high as 110 degrees) by planning your visit during
January or February, when temperatures
hover in the low 60s. But be sure to arrive by 3 p.m. to tour the dam
itself; visitors aren’t allowed to the top of the facility after dark,
which comes as early as 4:30 p.m. during that time of year.

Decorator with arguments: avoid parenthesis when no arguments

Below is my @logged() decorator maker. Here is roughly how it works:

It accepts a logger instance and a disabled flag.
If disabled is False, it outputs some logs before/after the decorated function.
If disabled is True, it outputs nothing and also suppresses the logger for the decorated function.

Both the logger and disabled arguments have their default values. However, when I want to use the default values, I still have to write empty parenthesis, like so:
@logged()
def foo():
    pass

Is there any way to get rid of these empty parenthesis when I just want the default arguments? Here is an example of what I would like to have:
@logged
def foo():
    pass

@logged(disabled=True)
def bar():
    pass

The code of the @logged() decorator maker:
import logging
import logging.config

from functools import wraps

def logged(logger=logging.getLogger('default'), disabled=False):
    '''
    Create a configured decorator that controls logging output of a function

    :param logger: the logger to send output to
    :param disabled: True if the logger should be disabled, False otherwise

MEMORANDUM*


2
Myron D. Smith (""Smith"") appeals his conviction for possession of illegal drugs in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, arguing that the district court erred by permitting impeachment of a defense witness with a thirteen-year-old conviction for filing a false statement.   Smith also appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in adjusting his offense level upward for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, and for possession of a firearm in a drug-related offense under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1).   The jury acquitted Smith of using a firearm during a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).


3
Smith argues that the trial court's evidentiary ruling allowing impeachment of his ""alibi"" witness was reversible, harmful error.   We disagree.   Evidence of a conviction that occurred more than ten years ago is not admissible to impeach a witness's credibility unless the district court makes a determination, supported by specific facts and circumstances, that the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect of the conviction.   Fed.R.Evid. 609(b).   The district court determined that the probative value of the thirteen-year-old felony conviction for filing a false statement was high because the witness's credibility was significant in light of the defense theory that the drugs in Smith's home were planted by others.   The district court also determined that any prejudice to Smith would be small because the conviction was used to impeach a witness other than Smith, and was for a crime unrelated to the crime for which Smith was being tried.   Moreover, Smith's witness can hardly be characterized as an alibi witness.   The witness's testimony, if fully believed, simply placed Smith out of his house near the time the house was searched, and placed Danny Wares, a convicted felon on parole, at the house along with other young people.   The witness provided no explanation or ""alibi"" as to how Wares or others could have set up a drug operation, including secret hiding compartments, in Smith's home, or why Smith's fingerprints were found on drug-related items.   Therefore, Smith's conviction is affirmed.

Quarter-game bandit

So I'm out east interviewing for residencies, and have been for a week or so and laundry day came. So I headed over to the laundromat wifey and I used when we were here last month and started a load of laundry and was about to head to best buy to chill while my clothes washed until I saw it - the quarter game that beat me last month.

Let me explain - this is a stupid little arcade-type game where idiots like me put quarters in with hopes that the quarters we put in will push previous idiots' quarters out into the reward bin. Last month I lost a dollar or so on this before tossing in the towel. BUT, right after I was finished, some yuppy walks up and puts some quarters in while simultaneously kicking the machine and DOWN come a ton of quarters. MY quarters. Jerk.

So this time I put 2 quarters in with no reward, and I remember the yuppy. So I decide to kick the thing a couple times. Nothing. so I kick a little harder - WEEEOOOEEOO. An alarm. There I was - a grown man, almost 30-year old almost doctor who just set off an alarm at a laundromat in front of 20 other people cause I wanted to make 75 cents, and fleeing from the scene. I was out of that place before 5 seconds had gone by.

So I walked to best buy for damage control. First, what in the same of sam hill did I just do? And second, why did I respond that way? And third, what do I do NOW? I thought... maybe I can just walk in, take my clothes out of the wash and walk out back to my room and hang dry all my clothes. Another idea was maybe if I put on different clothes no one will recognize me. These are"

One can inquire, by use of renormalization group plus $\epsilon$-expansion techniques, if infrared stable fixed points exist, which indicate the possible existence of a second or higher order transition. For $N_f\geq 3$ no such point exists, and the chiral transition is first order. At $N_f=2$, in the absence of anomaly ($c=0$) or if the $\eta '$ mass vanishes at $T_c$, no fixed point exists, the transition is first order, and also at $m$, $\mu\neq 0$ the transition is expected to be first order. In such a case no tricritical point exists in the plane $(\mu,T)$ of Fig. \[PHDIA\][@TRICRI]. If instead $m_{\eta '}\neq 0$ at $T_c$, and the $U_A(1)$ transition occurs at $T>T_c$, the symmetry group is $O(4)$ and the transition can be second order. In that case at $m$, $\mu\neq 0$ there is no transition but only a crossover, and a tricritical point is expected in the $(\mu,T)$ plane of Fig. \[PHDIA\].

For example, three tours ago in Fargo, North Dakota, there were literally eight people at our show, and last month we ticketed 206. They were all going nuts and having a blast, and that's honestly pretty consistent with the other places we tour. Same can be said for Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston, NYC, Champaign, Bloomington, etc. We're lucky to have these kinds of stories.

WW (AT): Would you consider yourself a ""popular band""?

AL: No... more like a little fish in a big sea. Though I don't think that's a bad place to be because there's always room to grow, as long as we keep our eyes open and jump at every opportunity to get our name out there. Now that we're dropping this album, I don't see us slowing down at all. We're going to push this as hard as we can because we know there are lots of people out there looking to have a good time with something fresh. That's what Kinetix is all about; we ain't your typical ball and chain.

We consider ourselves a band on the rise. In some areas of the country, we are popular. In some circles we are better known than others. We don't have a gimmick like a goofy YouTube video; instead, we rely on a genuine live performance. We don't want people to come to see us for that one song or one gimmick. We want to be popular and respected for our songwriting and live shows.

JL: You should ask our fans. That is not the context we think about ourselves. We pour our heart in soul into our music, because we enjoy what we do. It's for the fans to decide what's popular.

He’s not an eggplant.

Okay, I’m back. If you haven’t watched Orange is the New Black yet, please go do so because I need more people to talk to about it. The finale made me cry. The next-to-last scene. Man. I recommended the show to my local Christian radio afternoon talk show and I’m kind of giddy thinking about them watching lesbians exist. Am I a bad person?

Other thing that made me cry: Cory Monteith. Like, I legitimately ugly-cried for a solid 20 minutes in my bathroom the morning the news broke. I’ve been a gleek since before that word was even thought of. Hulu had a preview of the Glee pilot up about six months before the show actually aired, and I was hooked. I must have watched it 20 times before the series premiered. I used to live blog (live status?) every episode on Facebook until I discovered r/glee. I have so many thoughts, feelings, theories, and philosophies about Glee that it really explains why my dog is my only friend. (You’re my friend, too, blog. I’m exaggerating. Shhhh.) I just want to have a giant group hug with the entire cast and crew right now.

Today I slept in until 11:00, which is the latest I’ve slept since moving to morning shift in November. I figured I might as well make brunch and blog, because why not? There is no prompt for today (or any weekends) on NaBloPoMo, and I’m glad. I think these prompts are all kind of eh. Next week is discussing some quotes. I might do them. I might not. Maybe I should start my own list of prompts that aren’t terrible. Maybe I should eat cupcakes and listen to The Alton Browncast. (I’m listening to The Alton Browncast without cupcakes right now.)

Did I ever tell you I was picked to be a Sweat Pink Ambassador when I was doing my 5k training stuff? It makes me feel so guilty because I can’t bear to be outside (unless it’s in the pool) when the temperature is over, like, 78 degrees. I have a giant envelope of pink shoelaces that I’ll probably never use. If you want some, let me know. I’m all about sending out care packages lately. I can at least say that I’ve been doing yoga again, even if I haven’t been running. I can hold corpse pose for about an hour. I’m on my way to opening my own yoga studio.

One prompt from last week that I sort of liked and never did: “If you were trapped in an elevator, which three bloggers would you most want with you in that situation?”

Jes,Stephanie, and Daniel. Jes and Stephanie because I love them to bits and I’m sure we’d be having some sort of adventure that led us to being trapped in this elevator, and Daniel because he was the first hit that came up when I googled “Elevator repair blog.” It’d be good to have someone to who could fix the elevator, for sure.

806,23,5825,"This invention relates to a pressure vessel, and, more particularly, to a modular containment system for removing and replacing a cover of a pressure vessel. This invention is particularly applicable to removing and replacing bottom covers of coke drums.
The processing of crude oil into gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricants, and the like, as well as many other petroleum-refining operations, produces byproducts that have very little value. However, the value of these byproducts can be substantially increased when they are heated for a long enough time at a temperature sufficient to cause what is known as xe2x80x9cdestructive distillation.xe2x80x9d During the process of destructive distillation, a portion of the byproducts is converted to usable hydrocarbon products. The remainder is transformed into a solid carbon product called xe2x80x9ccoke.xe2x80x9d The temperature at which destructive distillation normally occurs is about 900 degrees F. Generally, an industrial furnace is used to incur destructive distillation.
Conventionally, a large pressure vessel known as a coke drum is provided at a furnace outlet for a sufficient amount of time to allow for a complete destructive distillation reaction. A typical coke drum is a large, vertical metal vessel with top and bottom closures. The actual size, shape, and configuration of the coke drum, however, can vary considerably from one installation to another. The bottom closure typically includes a relatively large and heavy removable cover that is secured to the drum by dozens of bolts. Disengagement and reengagement of the removable cover, known as unheading and heading, respectively, can be quite labor intensive, given the mass of the cover and the numerous bolts that hold it in place.
During the refining process, petroleum byproducts are deposited in the coke drum as a hot liquid slurry. Typically, the slurry enters the drum through an opening in the bottom closure. Lighter hydrocarbons, the products of destructive distillation, flow out the top of the coke drum while heavier material remains inside the drum.
After a coke drum is filled to the desired capacity and the flow of slurry into the drum ceases, the drum is cooled. This typically involves injecting steam into the drum to strip useful hydrocarbon vapors from the solid material and then injecting water into the drum to further cool the coke. The liquid mass remaining in the coke drum is substantially full of coke that, as it cools, hardens into solid material. This solid coke must be removed from the drum before the drum can be reused. The process of removing coke from a drum is referred to as xe2x80x9cdecoking.xe2x80x9d
A typical decoking process involves several steps. First, any water remaining in the drum is drained through piping to allow for removal of the cover from the bottom closure of the drum. In a hydraulic operation, as opposed to a manual operation, the cover is supported by a hydraulic lifting mechanism to detension the joint. Next, the cover must be unlocked from the coke drum and disengaged in a controlled manner by manipulating the bolts attaching the cover to a flange on the drum. The cover then is lowered by the hydraulic mechanism. As can be appreciated, unheading a coke drum can be a time consuming process. After unheading is complete, the coke in the drum is cut out of the drum by high pressure water jets. The operation is reversed to resecure the cover on the drum.
To help streamline the unheading process, oil refineries frequently use automated unheading devices. Such unheading devices typically are provided at the lower end of the coking drums for automatic and semi-automatic heading and unheading and are capable of being remotely operated. An example of a known remotely operated unheading device for a coking drum is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,109 to Malsbury et al.

==========

Over the last 25 years, cART has evolved into a highly effective therapy that prolongs the lifespan of HIV infected individuals. However, it only targets actively replicating virus in permissive cells \[[@CR1]\]. Indeed, infected individuals contain tissue reservoirs that replicate low levels of virus and may continually express low levels of Nef, one of HIV's key pathogenicity-associated accessory proteins \[[@CR2], [@CR3]\]. The goals of current HIV cure research are to eliminate these reservoirs thereby purging infected patients of HIV. An integral portion of this strategy is the reactivation of latent virus (shock) and the subsequent elimination of the cells producing the reawakened HIV (kill) by the immune response. An IL-15 agonist, ALT-803, is currently in phase 2 trials due to its ability to enhance the CTL response \[[@CR4]\]. However, shock and kill strategies will always be confronted with the ability of reactivated HIV-1 to produce a functional Nef protein that mediates critical HIV immune evasion effects. Indeed, HIV-1 Nef suppresses MHC-I antigen presentation in infected cells thereby blunting any therapeutic HIV vaccine efficacy.

Nef alters host cellular trafficking pathways to attenuate the immune response {#Sec2}
==============================================================================

During the early stages of the HIV life cycle, the most heavily transcribed gene within infected cells is *nef*. This robust Nef expression affects infected cells in numerous ways, including downregulation of key cell surface receptors such as MHC-I and CD4 \[[@CR3]\], enhancement of viral replication \[[@CR5]\], alteration of T cell activation \[[@CR6]\], and the subversion of the apoptotic machinery \[[@CR7]\]. The downregulation of CD4 prevents superinfection of the cell and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity \[[@CR8], [@CR9]\]. The downregulation of MHC-I atten"

# Browser.html

*Browser.html* is a research project aimed at building an experimental [Servo][] browser in HTML. This project has 2 major pieces:

- _Graphene_: a runtime for building native apps in HTML. It's currently in development and part of Servo.
- _Browser.html_: an experimental browser UI for desktop.

This repository is for Browser.html (the front-end). Active development of Graphene happens in the [Servo][] repository. Questions? Check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/browserhtml/browserhtml/wiki/FAQ).

![browser](./browser.gif)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/browserhtml/browserhtml/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help getting started.


## Development

There are two major components to the browser.html application.

1. Local server that serves application UI.
2. Client that is a application shell that connects to the server and renders served UI.


### Server

If you're working on the Browser.html front-end, you'll need [Node.js][] to install all dependencies and run the development toolchain.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/browserhtml/browserhtml.git
cd browserhtml
npm install --no-optional
```

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the server component with the following command:

``` sh
npm run build-server
```

Any changes to the source code will trigger a build, which is then automatically served. That will allow you to reload a client in order to see your changes. Alternatively you can use `live-server` to not only rebuild, but also trigger an automatic live code reload for the UI such that application state is preserved:

815,29,21562,"Introduction

Critical illness is characterized by oxidative stress, which is a major promoter of systemic inflammation and organ failure due to excessive free radical production, depletion of antioxidant defenses, or both. We hypothesized that exogenous supplementation of trace elements and vitamins could restore antioxidant status, improving clinical outcomes.

Critical illness is characterized by hyperinflammation, cellular immune dysfunction, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction [1]. Oxidative stress is defined as a state in which the level of toxic reactive oxygen intermediates overcome the endogenous antioxidant defenses of the host and damage biologically relevant molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates and unsaturated fatty acids of the cell membranes [2–5]. Oxidative stress may not be considered an epiphenomenon in the critically ill patient but part of the underlying pathophysiologic events leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [6].

The antioxidant endogenous defense system in humans consists of a variety of extracellular and intracellular antioxidants which are able to protect tissues from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) induced injury [3]. Trace elements, such as copper, manganese, zinc, iron and selenium are required for the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), respectively. In addition, the non-enzymatic defense mechanisms include endogenous molecules (that is, glutathione, albumin) and vitamins (such as E, C and β-carotene) [2, 3]. Low levels of endogenous vitamins and trace elements in SIRS are due to escape to the interstitial compartment by capillary leakage, hemodilution, previous insufficient intake, and continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) [7]. In the critically ill, the most severe cases of SIRS are associated with the most severe antioxidant depletion [8–10].

In the last two decades, several clinical trials have evaluated the role of antioxidant micronutrients as monotherapy or in combined therapy (enteral or parenteral antioxidant cocktails) as part of an antioxidant strategy for critically ill SIRS patients. These have been reviewed in prior meta-analyses but since these publications [11, 12], additional RCTs have been reported [13–18]. The aim of the current study was to provide an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis on all randomized clinical studies of vitamins and trace elements as pharmaconutrient therapy on relevant clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. In addition, we conducted several hypothesis-generating subgroup analyses to illuminate the optimal methods of administering antioxidants.

Study identification

We conducted a systematic review of the published literature to identify all relevant clinical trials using text word or MeSH headings containing ""randomized,"" ""blind,"" ""clinical trial,"" ""nutritional support"", ""enteral nutrition"", ""parenteral nutrition"", antioxidants,"" ""vitamins"", ""trace elements"", ""selenium"", ""zinc"", ""copper"", ""manganese"", ""vitamins A, C and E"", ""critical illness"" and ""critically ill"". To locate these articles we performed computerized searches on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) from 1980 to December 2011. We also searched our personal files and comprehensive review articles were searched for additional original studies. No language restrictions were placed on the searches. Abstracts from scientific meetings were accepted for inclusion into this systematic review if a copy of the manuscript was available to complete the abstraction form.

Dr. Josiah Litch (April 4, 1809 – January 31, 1886) was a Methodist Episcopal preacher in the New England region of the United States, who was best known for his connections with the Millerite movement, and for using Bible prophecy to predict a loss of power for the Ottoman Empire.

Biography

Early life and ministry
Josiah Litch was born April 4, 1809 in Lunenburg, Massachusetts. His parents' names were John and Jerusha (Lincoln) Litch, and on his mother's side, he was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln. He attended Wesleyan Academy at Wilbraham and joined the Methodist Episcopal ministry as an itinerant minister in 1833.

Litch spent his itinerant ministry traveling through Cape Cod and Rhode Island. He left the Methodist Episcopal ministry in 1841 to join the Millerites.

Family
Litch intended to marry Sarah Barstow on April 25, 1836. Sarah's father, William Barstow, was a fellow minister with the New England Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church. Josiah and Sarah had two children who survived to adulthood, Wilbur Fisk Litch, and Josiah Lincoln Litch.

Millerism
In 1838, a friend asked Josiah Litch to read the writings of William Miller. Litch at first was hostile to Miller's prediction of the second coming of Jesus, but after reading he was converted into the Millerite movement.

Litch then wrote his own book, The Probability of the Second Coming of Christ About A.D. 1843. In a comment on, Litch predicted that the Ottoman Empire would lose power in August 1840. When on August 11, 1840, the Ottoman Empire accepted guarantees from the Great Powers, it was interpreted as a fulfillment of Bible prophecy and Litch's interpretation thereof.

Litch was responsible for inviting Charles Fitch to reconsider his rejection of Miller's teachings. Fitch later became one of the foremost preachers in the Millerite movement.

Around 1841, the Millerite movement requested Litch to become the first general agent. Litch was granted release from his pastoral duties, and became the first paid Millerite worker. Litch was successful as a promoter and secretary for the movement.

Another idea that Litch developed was the idea of a pre-advent judgment. According to Litch, ""no human tribunal would think of executing judgment on a prisoner until after his trial; much less God."" He began to develop the idea in 1840, but didn't publish until 1841. After the Great Disappointment, some Millerites applied Litch's pre-advent judgment to October 22, 1844, the Millerites' predicted date of Jesus' return. The Seventh-day Adventists later developed this into the ""investigative judgment"" doctrine.

Litch was among the last of the prominent Millerites to accept the date of October 22, 1844, proposed by Samuel S. Snow, as the anticipated date of Jesus' return.

Beyond 1844
After the Great Disappointment, Litch first thought there was some misunderstanding with regard to what happened in 1844. In 1845, he was present at the Albany Conference where the Millerites who were opposed to the shut-door doctrine met to work out the meaning of the Great Disappointment, and determine the future of the movement.

Litch eventually worked with the Evangelical Adventists, and served as president of the American Millennial Association. He formed his own organization known as the Messianians, and served as president in both Pennsylvania, and Canada.

Litch slowly abandoned the historicist view of prophecy, in favor of futurism. He attended the Prophetic Conference held at the Church of Holy Trinity, in"

Dear Editor,

The World Health Organization ("
833,8,3980,"INTRODUCTION {#SEC1}
============

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle paralysis and death ([@B1]). About 5--10% of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion ([@B1]). Numerous genes have been identified as disease-causative, and have been central to the understanding of pathogenesis. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), most prominently TDP-43 and FUS, have been identified as a major category of causative genes in familial ALS ([@B2],[@B3]). Both TDP-43 and FUS have multiple roles in RNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, polyadenylation, miRNA processing and RNA transport ([@B4]). Although both proteins are predominantly localized to the nucleus, in post-mortem brain tissue from mutation carriers a mislocalization of the affected protein to the cytoplasm can be observed. This shared pathology has suggested both a nuclear loss of function and a cytoplasmic gain of toxic function to play a role in familial FUS and TDP-43 ALS ([@B9]). Although many studies have investigated the physiological functions of FUS and TDP-43 through knockout and overexpression experiments ([@B10]), the effect of disease-causing mutations on RNA splicing has been more challenging to investigate. Due to the fact that both proteins are very sensitive to dosage changes and very tightly regulated ([@B24],[@B25]), mutation overexpression models are unfit to address these questions.

We and others have used mice carrying mutations in the endogenous *Tardbp* gene to show that TDP-43 mutations induce a splicing gain of function ([@B26],[@B27]). Here, we use our novel knockin mouse model of FUS-ALS, FUS-Δ14 ([@B28]), in combination with data from other physiological mouse and cellular models of FUS-ALS, to address the impact of ALS-causing FUS mutations on RNA metabolism, and splicing in particular. Although mutations have been observed throughout the FUS gene, the most aggressive FUS ALS-causing mutations cluster in the C-terminal region of the protein, where the nuclear localization signal (NLS) resides (Figure [1A](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}) ([@B29]). These mutations affect the binding of the nuclear localization signal by the nuclear import receptor Transportin (TNPO1) and induce an increase in cytoplasmic localization of the protein ([@B29],[@B30]).

![Illustration of the models and mutations used in this study. (**A**) Transcript and protein structure of FUS. The major transcript encoding the FUS protein in humans and mice is comprised of 15 exons. FUS protein contains a low complexity domain (LCD), an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, two Arginine-Glycine-Glycine (RGG) domains, a zinc finger domain (Znf) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) ([@B29]). (**B**) The three mouse FUS NLS mutations used in this study. The Bozzoni group knocked in a point mutation to create the FUS P517L line, a missense mutation equivalent to the human ALS P525L mutation. The Dupuis group created a FUS ΔNLS line where the entire NLS is removed. We have used the FUS-Δ14 mouse, where a frameshift mutation leads to the skipping of exon 14 and a frameshifting of the remaining NLS sequence. (**C**) The FUS knockout alleles used by each group. STOP here refers to the GeneTrap transgene used. (**D**) Schematic explaining the two joint models created from the six individual gene expression datasets. (**E**) Proposed rationale for study. In wild-type cells FUS protein is predominantly nuclear but can shuttle to and from the cytoplasm. When FUS is knocked out it will be reduced in both compartments but if the NLS is mutated or deleted then FUS will accumulate in the cytoplasm due to reduced nuclear import.](gkaa410fig1){#F1}

RB: I think the US has made great progress in recent years, thanks in part to the far-reaching powers granted to individual states in setting their own policies. That’s where we see the greatest potential for positive change. The federal government has decided not to intervene in these new approaches to cannabis decriminalisation, legalisation and regulated sale, and has also struck a much softer tone on the international stage, particularly with regard to the upcoming review of international drug treaties. As a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, I welcome any effort to shift course away from prohibition and criminalisation. But I won’t move an inch from the position I’ve always taken: I will lend my voice to causes and issues I believe in, but I won’t give financial support to political parties. I feel it’s wrong for business to do that.

NS: To many, the connection between Richard Branson and a desire to see a reform in drugs laws seems quiet surprising (despite your somewhat rock ‘n’ roll past!). What is your personal motivation for backing this campaign? Why drugs reform and not something else like eliminating Malaria or curing Parkinson’s?

RB: I know many people that have struggled with addiction. Some were killed by it, and there is part of me that thinks that they could still be alive if our drug policies didn’t put so much emphasis on prohibition and enforcement. Everyone with a drug problem deserves compassion and treatment, not prison.

Over the years, I have had many conversations with people who were caught in a vicious cycle of criminalisation, often due to minor, non-violent drug offences. Arrested for possession of just a small amount of drugs, they had a criminal record which made it nearly impossible to get their lives back in order. And from there, it just kept getting worse. I don’t think that anyone deserves to be treated that way, especially if they haven’t harmed anyone. On a broader level, I think prohibition and criminalisation have just been a colossal waste of taxpayer money.

I can think of few issues where public policy in many countries stands in such stark contrast to what we know should be done to effectively address the problem. That’s enormously frustrating. Repressive drug policies are causing enormous harm to thousands, if not millions, of people around the world. They prevent many living with HIV/AIDS or Hepatitis from receiving proper medical care"

How to add a custom item to a specific WordPress menu item position

I have a primary menu registered and displayed that consists of 4 links (home, about, news, blog). I want to add html (a logo) in between the second and third menu and I was wondering if this was possible.
Here is a diagram:
HOME | About | Logo | News | Blog
I was looking at the hook wp_nav_menu_items but I can only add a custom item to either the first position or last. 
Before I used jQuery to add html but since the DOM has to be fully loaded the logo loads last and I'm trying to get the logo to show first or at the same time with the content of the page.

A:

I solved similar problem this way:
add_filter('wp_nav_menu_items','add_custom_in_menu', 10, 2);

function add_custom_in_menu( $items, $args ) 
{
    if( $args->theme_location == 'primary' ) // only for primary menu
    {
        $items_array = array();
        while ( false!== ( $item_pos = strpos ( $items, '<li', 3 ) ) )
        {
            $items_array[] = substr($items, 0, $item_pos);
            $items = substr($items, $item_pos);
        }
        $items_array[] = $items;
        array_splice($items_array, 2, 0, '<li>custom HTML here</li>'); // insert custom item after 2nd one

        $items = implode('', $items_array);
    }
    return $items;
}

Please notice, it works only for single-level menu.

A:

Little variation on Compass' solution, getting rid of the loop.
add_filter('wp_nav_menu_items','add_custom_in_menu', 10, 2);

// add in Logo in the middle of the menu
//
function add_custom_in_menu( $items, $args )
{
    if( $args->theme_location == 'footer_navigation' )
    {
        $new_item       = array( '<li class=""menu-logo""><a href=""/""><img src=""'. get_template_directory_uri(). '/assets/img/logo.png"" alt=""""></a></li>' );
        $items          = preg_replace( '/<\/li>\s<li/', '</li>,<li',  $items );

        $array_items    = explode( ',', $items );
        array_splice( $array_items, 2, 0, $new_item ); // splice in at position 3
        $items          = implode( '', $array_items );
    }
    return $items;
}

One way would be to create 2 navigation menu's which are then used.
header_menu_1 | LOGO | header_menu_2
Within the back-end, you'd need to create a new header location and then add the 2 menu items to it.
Then within your header.php file, have this code.
<?php
    $args1 = array('menu' => 'header_menu_1' );
    $args2 = array('menu' => 'header_menu_2' );
    wp_nav_menu($args1);

Why is poker a ""sport"" and not just a ""game?""

So, first off, as tempting as it might be to do so, this is not an invitation to wax poetic on   poker.  I actually don't play it, but I know how it works. 
The question really is one of etymology.  Poker is often referred to as a sport nowadays.  A quick google search will reveal over 87 million hits to the query ""poker as a sport"".  It is covered on ESPN, and in the last few days I have heard both NPR and seen USA Today refer to it as such.  Full disclosure, I work for Gannett, the parent company of USA Today.
What I would like to know is, ""Why?""
To be clear, I find the claim dubious, but if it is being referred to as a sport, there should be some rationality behind it. If not, then is it merely an idiom in the making?
I understand what a game is - it is a test of skill in some fashion.  I understand what a sport is, at least in the abstract.  Football is a sport and has games.  Monopoly is a game, but rarely a sport.  Hiking is a sport, though, one rarely hears of ""hiking games.""  So, while clearly there is an overlap between the two, there is also a set of attributes that differentiates the two.
So, ultimately, what are those factors that adhere to the words ""Sport"" and ""Game,"" that are common to both and those that differentiate the two. Ideally, I'd love a Venn Diagram of sorts that defines the relationship of these words.
But most importantly, I'd like to understand the reasons for putting poker in the ""Sports"" circle.

A:

It isn't a sport. 
From Oxford Dictionaries: an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment
I don't know of any poker players who actually call their game a sport. I know a few who play online for 8-10 hours a day, every day. Though they may be mentally tired, none consider themselves athletes. You cannot have a sport without athletes.

840,25,11341,"Roy Hodgson was thinking like a coach when he wrote down the name of Javier Mascherano as his No1 pick for this year’s Ballon d’Or. And the many who derided his choice – including former players in the media as well as journalists and fans – are, to sanitise a phrase used in similar circumstances by Sir Alex Ferguson, all idiots.

More specifically, Hodgson was thinking like the man who is paid to coach the England team. So he wasn’t out to lavish his votes on glamour boys such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi, who once again claimed the top two positions. Instead he voted for those who, out of all the players in the world, would make the biggest difference to his own team: Mascherano, followed by Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer.

These are not men who dismantle defences to score the sort of goals you can look at over and over again. They are the ones who stop that happening, so that the Ronaldos and Messis in their own team can do their stuff. The annual choice of the voters, 544 football professionals around the world, consistently fails to recognise that the game is made up of more than one dimension. Although Neuer made it to the final three this year, there was never a chance that the man who imbued his Germany team-mates with the sense of security that allowed them to win the World Cup last summer would prevail over a losing finalist and a man whose team did not make it past the group stage.

If I were the Football Association, his employers, or an England fan, I would be delighted by this evidence of Hodgson’s secure sense of priorities, and that he can see beyond the absurd scoring statistics compiled by the two best forwards in the chronically unbalanced Spanish first division. He is a thoughtful man who takes his responsibilities seriously, including the task of voting in the Ballon d’Or poll. And look where it got him.

One incident this week exemplified the sort of difficulties faced by the England manager. The Premier League clubs managed to block his little plan – unwisely leaked to the media a few weeks ago – for a dinner with his squad to break the long gap between their last match, against Slovenia on 15 November, and their next one, against Lithuania on 27 March.

Four months of inactivity must seem interminable for a manager more used to the day to day activity of club football. It seems wholly reasonable that he would want to gather his players together, to help them build and retain a sense of teamship.

The humorist Giles Smith used his Times column to predict the gradual demise of the scheme as the players pulled out one by one, presenting a variety of flimsy excuses and ultimately leaving Hodgson to dine all alone. But Smith was too cautious. The get-together was nixed with a single announcement that failed to disguise the contempt of those who made the decision to withdraw the players’ co-operation.

A disappointed Hodgson will not allow himself to be deflected from the job of making tactical and selectorial plans for Euro 2016, and his choice of Mascherano can be taken as an indication of what he believes England are missing.

In most of today’s best teams, the defensive midfield player – or whatever you want to call him – is the key position around which the rest are assembled. If Mascherano plays at centre-back for Barcelona, that is because the club have a decent alternative in his usual position and are short of authoritative central defenders who can also distribute the ball. But he continues to play at the base of midfield for Argentina, and it was there that he gave one of the outstanding individual performances of the World Cup when Holland were stifled in the semi-final.

It was not Mascherano’s fault that his country so narrowly lost the final. He had built the platform. The forwards, including Messi, failed to exploit it (although had Ángel di María not succumbed to injury, Argentina might well have won and we would not now be lavishing quite so much praise on German football).

Mascherano’s attributes, like those of Claude Makelele, are different from those of Messi and Ronaldo, but just as difficult to acquire and perhaps even harder to maintain season after season. They include perception, anticipation, unselfishness, courage, physical tenacity and a shrewd appreciation of how far the rules of the game can be stretched. Such a player, like Makelele at Real Madrid and Chelsea, might never bring the crowd to their feet, but he will earn the profound respect and gratitude of his team-mates.

He will also be awfully hard to replace, as Liverpool discovered after Mascherano’s departure for Barcelona. The difference between the Anfield club’s results this season, before and after the decision to recall Lucas Le"

Low oil prices push 41 energy companies into bankruptcy

Saying that 2015 has been a difficult year for the oil and gas sector would be an understatement.

U.S. crude oil benchmark WTI averaged $91.23 per barrel in 2014, while in 2015 it has, to date, averaged $49.12. That’s a 46% decline, and it shows no signs of recovering soon. WTI today stands at $36.08, 34% lower than the year-ago price of $55.26. Future crude oil prices for December 2024 currently sit at just $54.96.

This sharp decline in prices has put the oil and gas industry in a difficult position. Many companies have adapted to the new reality of low oil prices, but that’s easier to accomplish for companies with right-sized balance sheets. Not all have been so fortunate. As of mid-December, 41 oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the court system. Their collective debt, both secured and unsecured, totals more than $16 billion dollars.

Once a company files for Chapter 11 protection with the court system, management continues to run the day-to-day business operations, but all significant business decisions must be approved by a bankruptcy court. Once a company files Chapter 11, one or more committees is appointed to represent the interests of creditors and stockholders in a process of working with the company to develop a plan of reorganizing to get it out of debt.

Creditors with secured debt, which is backed by collateral, are paid back first after the company files Chapter 11, with those holding unsecured debt paid next. Common equity stockholders are last in line. Although a company may emerge from bankruptcy as a viable entity, generally, the creditors and the bondholders become the new owners of the shares.

Instead of allowing a company to continuing operating, those in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are forced to sell off any un-exempt assets to pay creditors. A trustee is appointed, and they ensure that any assets that are secured are sold and that the proceeds are paid to the specific creditors.

Oil and gas debt from bankruptcies 52% secured

Debt in the oil and gas companies that filed for bankruptcy in 2015 was split very nearly down the middle of secured and unsecured debt. The 41 companies had a combined secured debt load of $8.7 billion, with another $8.0 billion in unsecured debt. The total debt of the companies was approximately $16.7 billion.

The average total level of debt for the companies that filed for bankruptcy in 2015 was $406.7 million dollars. The average secured debt was $222.8 million, while the average unsecured debt for the companies was $204.7 million.

The largest bankruptcy of any single E&P company happened on September 16, 2015. Samson Resources filed for Chapter 11 protection reporting total debt was $4.3 billion. Its bankruptcy made up roughly 30% of the total dollar value of oil and gas bankruptcy filings.

Samson entered bankruptcy with a pre-arranged plan to reduce its debt by swapping control to a group of investors who held the company’s $1 billion second-lien loan. Those lenders were also planning to buy $450 million in stock in the reorganized Samson. There has been no final plan announcement as of December 18.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP purchased Samson for $7.2 billion in 2011. Phil Cook, Samson CFO, made known Samson’s thinking, and the industry’s for that matter, during bankruptcy court proceedings:

“Oil and gas companies across the United States and around the world are feeling the pressure from the downward spiral in commodity prices, and the fate of many of these companies is yet to be determined. Access to capital is the lifeblood of exploration and production companies. With increasing leverage because of a constant need for capital, together with the recent rising cost of capital in the industry, operating in the current environment has been—and likely will"

852,24,27916," The paper argues that France strengthened the vertical chain of authority to reinforce the central government's role in the definition of a national health policy. In the mid-1990s, a 'wave' of agencification occurred in the areas of public health. The Juppé reforms (1996) created the Regional Hospital Agencies (RHAs) that took over some, but not all, responsibilities from the Ministry of Health, such as the County Bureau of Social and Sanitary Affairs or *Direction Départementale des Affaires Sanitaires et Sociales* to determine health priorities with the input of the Regional Health Conferences and the Regional Committees on Health or *Comite Regionaux d'Organisation de Santé*. RHAs introduced novel management practices \[[@CR57]\] such as multi-years performance contracts with care providers. On top of that were the National Accreditation and Evaluation Agency and a High Authority on Health. In recent years, however, France rejected the decision on decentralization of health care and, more generally, the NPM-endorsed disaggregation of health agencies that were traditionally advocated in Anglo-Saxon countries \[[@CR58]--[@CR60]\]. The 2009 Hospital, Patients, Health, and Territories (HPST) Act enforced a re-concentration of all health responsibilities -- not just the hospital prerogatives of the earlier RHA -- into a Regional Health Agency. Moreover, the smaller regulatory and service delivery agencies (the Regional Public Health Groups or *Groupements Régionaux de Santé Publique*, the Regional Health committees or *Missions Régionales de Santé*, and the Regional Sickness Funds) were regrouped into the Regional Health Agencies. France adopted contractual agreements for its care providers and focused on outcome-oriented rather than input-based budgets. However, despite reiterated calls for greater accountability and transparency \[[@CR61]\] and a movement towards an 'audit society' \[[@CR62]\], misrepresentation has remained high \[[@CR63]\]. Finally, French NPM reforms restricted democratic planning and led to a re-concentration of health organizations to achieve greater national coherence.

Diagnostic related groups (DRGs) and the quest for central government control {#Sec5}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Originally derived from the 30-year-old Program of Medicalization of Information Systems or *Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information*, activity-based payment or *Tarification a l'Activité* is the French version of the US Diagnostic-Related Groups (DRG) (i.e., a group of patients with medically-related and economically-comparable diagnosis), as defined by Fetter \[[@CR64]\]. Unlike the former fixed global budget based on regional demographics, such as population size and age covering all hospital expenditures, DRGs, referred to as Homogenous Groups of Patients ('*Groupes Homogenes de Malades*') in France are pre-determined reimbursement rates that reflect services that are actually delivered. DRGs are a good proxy for the broader concept of NPM, because DRGs draw on two of its basic principles: firstly, a split between financing, primarily from the government, and care provision by hospitals; secondly, incentivisation and competition for patients \[[@CR60], [@CR65]\], as care providers' income is directly related to patient volume \[[@CR66]\]. This uniform DRG rate schedule for all hospitals nationwide replaced the former hospital financing model that depended on patient length of stay, local demographic factors such as population size, and the hospital bargaining power during fee negotiation with the central government. With care providers' funding currently depending almost solely on DRGs (their penetration rate increased from 10% in 2004 to 100% in 2011 for French public hospitals, the highest in Europe) \[[@CR67]\] and other supplementary payments, for instance for research and training, hospitals are rewarded, or punished"

Name?

David Scatliffe.

Age?

17.

Location?

The US of A.

Development tool(s) of choice?

What do you do?

I make games, music, music videos, and other stuff.. probably just anything that can somewhat entertain people.

How did you get into game development?

I really just got into it by being bored out of my mind. I tried making little flash animations and writing.. but that didn’t turn out so well. So one day, when my trial of flash expired, I googled “game maker” and the rest is pretty much history.

What are your goals and aspirations as a game developer?

All I really want to do is release a game on steam, maybe get a game on Xbox Live Arcade, and make a game for Adult Swim. I want to be able to live well off of my little game exploits, and rub it in the faces of the ones who didn’t believe in me, haha.

Who didn’t believe in you?

Just some of the kids at school (and some of the counsellors). I didn’t get very good grades in school, so I guess I can’t blame them. I guess they thought I was going to try and get some big job at EA or something. Who knows?

What ultimately inspires you to keep creating?

There’s this feeling that I get sometimes when I feel like I’m making something truly awesome, that’s 100% me. That, mixed with the feeling of learning something really cool and useful, is what inspires me to keep making stuff. And of course, I wouldn’t be anywhere without the many brilliant indie developers out there, busting their asses.

After taking a ‘break’ from game making, are you back working on stuff?

I haven’t been really busy making games, although I’m still constantly prototyping stuff. Nowadays, I’ve just been collaborating with other indies (making music and sound effects for their stuff), which is equally enjoyable.

What happened to Xycle+ and what other game development related projects have you been working on in recent times?

Xycle+ (now Xycle2) is pretty close to getting finished. It’s taken a bit long (I think it’s been a year in development) but soon we’ll finally have something really groovy for people to play (and possibly curse at). I also got some really great guys to help out with some remixes for the OST, which should be out around the same time that the game’s released.



As for my other projects, I can’t say too much.. most of the time they start as cool little ideas that I work on for a day or so, but I just lose interest… I’m not really sure why.

You switched your own role from game developer over to game designer / collaborator. Why did you decide to go in this direction?

More money for the underfunded California State Teachers Retirement System may be considered by the Legislature next year, thanks to new attention from lawmakers and a state budget deficit narrowed by a voter-approved tax increase this month.

After years of ignoring pleas for a rate hike, the Legislature approved a resolution last August, SCR 105, that asks CalSTRS to meet with “affected stakeholders” and present three options for a long-term funding solution by next Feb. 15.

A phased-in rate increase would not begin for several years, if it follows scenarios suggested earlier this year. And splitting a rate hike between teachers and employers may be a difficult legal and political task, complicated by new pension reform legislation.

But after years of spending cuts to close big deficits, the state budget picture has sharply improved, brightened by a slowly recovering economy and a major tax increase approved by voters this month, Proposition 30 sponsored by Gov. Brown.

866,9,8716,", the FDIC sent to plaintiff a Notice of Intention to Foreclose the mortgage on the property on April 23, 1992. Plaintiff then instituted this action in Rhode Island Superior Court, seeking an injunction restraining the FDIC from proceeding with the foreclosure, and an order of equitable reformation or equitable cancellation of the contract, note and mortgage, on the grounds that they were the result of a mutual mistake of the parties as to the actual value of the property plaintiff received.
Plaintiff's mutual mistake claim is based on the theory that both parties to the contract, plaintiff and Capitol Bank, were mistaken as to the solvency of Capitol Bank, and Capitol Bank's ability to provide the promised renovation funding. Plaintiff asserts that without the renovation funding the property was not worth $80,000, and that therefore the parties were both mistaken as to the value of the consideration received by plaintiff.
The FDIC removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and immediately secured transfer of the action to this Court. Defendant then moved to dismiss the case pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The FDIC argued that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, in that he did not file his proof of claim by the bar date, and because he filed suit in the wrong court. Defendant also argued that plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim because it is barred by 12 U.S.C. § 1823(e), and that this Court, under 12 U.S.C. § 1821(j), lacks the power to issue the injunctive relief requested.
The parties engaged in oral argument on October 2, 1992, and the matter was taken under advisement. Subsequently the FDIC withdrew its argument that plaintiff failed to file a proof of claim by the bar date, and asked that the Court decide this motion on the other grounds asserted in its memorandum.
The matter is now in order for decision.

II. Discussion
Defendant has moved for dismissal of this action under both Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The FDIC first asks this Court to find that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action because plaintiff has not complied with the administrative claims procedure. If the Court finds that it has no jurisdiction over this action, it need not reach the Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L"

868,0,5465,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a heterogeneous group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that occur in humans, ruminant herbivores, mink, and cats. Sheep scrapie is the prototype of this group. TSEs are characterized by deposition of prion proteins (also denoted as PrP-Scrapie or PrPSc, the infectious form of the proteins), in the central nervous system of affected individuals. Prions have been defined as small proteinaceous infectious particles which resist inactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids. The term “prion” is a contraction of the words “protein” and “infection,” and prions are comprised largely if not exclusively of PrP-Sc molecules encoded by a PrP gene. Prion diseases are often called spongiform encephalopathies because of the post mortem microscopic or histopathologic appearance of the brain of an infected animal with large vacuoles in the cortex and cerebellum. Prion proteins are insoluble, protease-resistant glycoproteins resulting from post translational modification of normal mammalian glycoproteins (PrP-Cellular or PrP-C). Deposition of the prion protein, an abnormal isoform of a native cellular sialoglycoprotein, in the central nervous system is a reliable marker of TSE infection.

Five months later he assigned his interest in the unit to the parties' son and daughter-in-law, notwithstanding a court order preventing the parties from disposing of any assets. In August 1981, the son was divorced, and he and Harry became owners of Unit 20E, each with a 50% beneficial interest in the *257 land trust holding title to the unit. The unit was sold in June 1983.
Unit 22A was purchased for $62,500 in January 1978. Harry testified that he and Elaine each put $6,000 down on the unit and that they co-signed a mortgage for the remainder. The unit was sold in July 1981 for $120,000. The proceeds from the sale were used for the down payment on a $116,000 townhouse in Highland Park. Harry and Elaine currently reside in the townhouse.
Additionally, in 1979 Harry and Elaine purchased a Florida condominium for $98,000. Title was transferred in 1981 to Elaine alone. In August 1982, the condominium was sold for $135,000.
William Coscioni, a certified public accountant, testified on Maureen's behalf concerning Harry's finances. Coscioni examined income tax returns, loan documents, stock transactions and other records for Excellent Builders from the years 1977 through 1981. His examination also included bank accounts, financial statements and the individual tax returns of Harry and Elaine for the years 1976 to 1982. Based on his examination, Coscioni testified that Harry's ""real"" or disposable income was as follows: $102,869 in 1978; $167,272 in 1979; $82,533 in 1980; $101,222 in 1981; and $91,300 in 1982.
Coscioni also stated that Harry's actual salary from Excellent Builders dropped from $128,000 in 1977 to an estimated $55,000 in 1982. However, concurrent with Harry's salary decline was a corresponding increase in loans to him from Excellent. As a result, Harry's ""real income"" actually remained fairly consistent from 1976 through 1981. The only exception was in 1979, when Harry's real income was $167,272. In that year, Harry received Las Vegas gambling winnings of $50,000, an automobile valued at $7,000 as a prize, a tax refund of $26,000 and a $10,000 increase in his loan account from Excellent Builders. Harry did not report his gambling winnings on his tax return, nor pay any tax on the money.
Coscioni further testified that the value of Excellent Builders on the date of dissolution was $259,000 and that its current value is $359,000. His valuation was based on several factors, including Harry's personal financial statement dated August 15, 1978, admitted into evidence by stipulation. The financial statement had been submitted by Harry to Continental Bank to secure a loan.
Coscioni also testified that Harry's assets as of October 31, 1982, totalled slightly more than $2,000,000. This calculation included the following: small amounts of cash, marketable securities worth $38,000, nonmarketable securities valued at $104,000, stock in Excellent Builders valued at $359,000, parcels of real estate in suburban Flossmoor (Baythorn Development), the Kedzie Avenue building housing Excellent *258 Builders, the Highland Park townhouse, a condominium on Lake Shore Drive and personal property valued at approximately $"

872,23,7913,"Turok: Dinosaur Hunter garnered critical acclaim when it first released in 1997. While not as revolutionary as GoldenEye 007, it proved that first-person shooters were viable on console.

But how does Turok: Dinosaur Hunter fare over two decades later, especially now that first-person shooters on console are commonplace?

What’s Turok: Dinosaur Hunter about?

Despite its name, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter doesn’t actually involve hunting dinosaurs (but you do get to fight them). Instead, the game follows Tal’Set, a native-American warrior who assumes the mantle of Turok. Whoever is Turok must protect the magical barrier that exists between Earth and the Lost Land.

The Lost Land is an otherworldy place where time has no meaning. Humans, dinosaurs and cyborgs all co-exist. And despite being a primitive place, the Lost Land is home to a surprising amount of advanced technology.

The setting allows for a lot of creative freedom, but at the same time everything fits together.

As Turok, you must stop the Campaigner – an evil overlord hellbent on ruling the universe. Across eight levels you must battle his forces before engaging in a final showdown with him.

Lost in the fog

One of the first things you notice about Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is that it features heavy fog.

It uses this to mask the game’s limited draw distance. As a result, you can only see a very short distance in front of you.

It’s hard to appreciate the game’s environments, and very easy to lose your bearings. You can bring up a wireframe map, which helps, but feels out of place given the setting.

The fog does, however, add to the game’s atmosphere. Enemies can get very close to you before you spot them, making you feel bit more vulnerable. Seeing a raptor suddenly emerge from from fog and run straight towards you never stops being slightly terrifying.

Treasure hunt

You must find keys in each level to progress through Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.

Some of these keys are well hidden, and the game’s fog makes it all too easy to miss them. There’s also no indication of when you’re near a key or at least on the right track.

It’s possible to finish a mission without finding them all. This means you can end up having to play through some missions multiple times, which becomes tedious very quickly.

You only receive some keys after beating a boss. This wouldn’t be an issue, but you only find out about a boss after you’ve entered the level�"
873,16,24661,"The field of this invention is teleconferencing, and particularly teleconferencing using an internetwork comprising a connection-oriented and a connectionless network.
Teleconferencing is carried out by certain known systems using a connection-oriented network or internetwork. An internetwork is defined as a set of networks that are directly or indirectly interconnected. The most prevalent example of a connection-oriented network is the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). As shown in FIG. 1, teleconferences on the PSTN 11 are established in a known fashion in one embodiment by a PSTN teleconference bridge 12 that has been preconfigured to establish the teleconference, e.g., with certain participants 13, at a certain time, etc. In one embodiment, one of the participants 13 preconfigures the bridge 12. In another embodiment, a teleconference administrator 14 preconfigures the bridge 12. In one embodiment, the bridge 21 calls the predetermined participants 13 and authenticates them. In another embodiment, the participants 13 call the bridge 12 and authenticate themselves. An example of an authentication mechanism is the entry of a password using Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) signals at a prerecorded audio prompt from the bridge 12. The bridge 12 bridges the authenticated connections, enabling the participants 13 to communicate with each other. A teleconference over a connection-oriented network such as the PSTN offers high quality, low latency multimedia transmission and reliable connections. Multimedia is defined to be information of the form of at least one of the group of audio, text, video, animation and graphics. Latency is defined to be the delay between the time information is sent and time it is received. A connection-oriented teleconference connection can be disadvantageously expensive, and does not readily offer the caller a multimedia interface useful for controlling and monitoring the status of the teleconference that is easily accessed using any of a number of general purpose software packages implemented on a wide variety of hardware platforms and networks. A useful teleconferencing multimedia interface would provide information such as the availability of teleconferences for which a user is scheduled or free to join; information on the status of a teleconference ("

Howard Fosdick wrote about one of my favorite languages, Rexx, on OnLAMP earlier this week.

For many years, I did almost all my programming in Rexx, mostly on VM/CMS but occasionally on TSO or OS/2; it was a language well-suited to the environment and to the kinds of problems I had to deal with, especially when augmented with tools like WAKEUP (providing event handling) and RXSOCKET (TCP/IP socket access), as well as the invaluable CMS Pipelines. One of the best features of Rexx was its ubiquity on VM/CMS; because it used system hooks, it was available as a macro language for any program which needed one — and so it was far easier for a developer to use Rexx than to make up a unique language.

Back in 1989, Almaden’s only connection to Usenet was an AIX box, which dialed out once a day and fetched the day’s postings. I wanted real-time access to Usenet, especially misc.kids (this was long ago, before spam was invented, and so there was some actual content on Usenet), but our only connection to the ARPANet was on VM. So I wrote some Rexx code to gateway postings through VM to the AIX box (and back); it was probably about 2000 lines of Rexx and needed four virtual machines to run (CMS was single-threaded). Since the postings were traversing VM, it also seemed like a good idea to gateway them into our VM-based conferencing system — and at one time, that traffic accounted for 25% of the network traffic in IBM.

Rexx was the native macro language on OS/2, as well, and at one time, my OS/2 Gopher client had a hook to allow writing Rexx macros. Unfortunately,"

Specifically, respondents were asked (a) whether they believe that adolescents can be diagnosed with a PD, (b) whether they actually diagnose PDs in adolescents, and if not (c) what their reasons are for not diagnosing PDs in adolescents, and (d) whether they offer a specialized treatment for adolescents with PDs. The response categories for not diagnosing a PD in adolescents were as follows: 1) adolescence is a stormy developmental phase and personality pathology in adolescence is transient, 2) diagnosing a personality disorder in adolescents is not allowed according to the DSM-IV-TR, 3) the diagnosis is stigmatizing, and 4) other; please specify.

Results
=======

The majority of psychologists (57.8%) agreed that PDs can be diagnosed in adolescents. Significantly more psychologists who work with adolescents believe that PDs can be diagnosed in adolescents (64%) compared to psychologists working with adults only (46.2%), (Chi-square=19.99, *p\<* 0.001).

Yet, of psychologists working with adolescents, only 8.7% (32 participants) reported that they indeed diagnose PDs in adolescents if applicable, and only 6.5% (24 participants) offered a specialized treatment. Treatment methods most used for these adolescents were Mentalization-based Treatment (MBT, 25%), Emotion Regulation Training (ERT, 16.7%), Schema-focused Therapy (SFT, 12.5%), and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, 12.5%).

Barack Obama met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office two days after the 2016 election. (Pete Souza / Wikimedia Commons)

It is as if the Gambino and Genovese crime families were arguing their turf disputes in the courts and the news media. The Democrats are screaming bloody murder over President Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, whom Hillary Clinton still blames for her defeat at the polls and who the bipartisan War Party has never forgiven for Comey’s earlier hesitancy to blame the Russians for the same offense. Now that Trump has cut Comey loose — ostensibly for his handling of the Clinton emails scandal, according to three letters sent by Trump and his two top Justice Department officials – the Democrats have stepped up calls for a special prosecutor to continue the evidence-less crusade against the Kremlin.

It’s the Saturday Night Massacre all over again, cry the Democrats, harkening back to the weekend in 1973 when President Nixon fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. But this is not about the rule of law — quite the opposite: it’s about continuing the momentum of the U.S. military offensive begun in 2011 under President Obama, a wholly illegal aggression that has destroyed Libya, killed half a million Syrians, delivered vast regions to the control of the two feuding factions of al-Qaida, and brought the world closer to nuclear annihilation than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis.

The War Party is determined to make the offensive permanent, to keep up the pressure on the ultimate targets, Russia and China, until they break or capitulate to U.S. domination of the world. The current, rabid anti-Russian hysteria adds another layer of fake news on top of the wholly fictional U.S. “War on Terror” scenario. But these mega-lies can no longer mask the great obscenity of the 21st century: that the U.S. is allied with al-Qaida, whose jihadists act as imperialism’s foot soldiers in the Middle East.

Donald Trump thought last month’s attack on Syria had bought him immunity, or at least a respite, from the wrath of the War Party, which was determined to burn him at the political stake — not for his raging racism and hostility to civil liberties, but for his previously stated opposition to “regime change” and never-ending tensions with Russia. Trump’s 59-missile salvo against a Syrian airbase was supposed to wipe the slate clean and forgive his heresies"

We’re going to have a signing summit, which is even better,” the president said, referring to plans he announced Sunday to host the Chinese leader at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida next month. “So hopefully, we can get that completed. But we’re getting very, very close.... I think it’s going to happen, and it could happen fairly soon.”

AD

Trump spoke as investors digested his cancellation one day earlier of a scheduled increase in tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to give negotiators more time to strike a deal. The import levies were slated to rise to 25 percent on Saturday from 10 percent, a move that would have significantly increased the trade war’s economic costs.

AD

The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 26,091.95, up more than 60 points or 0.23 percent. That paled alongside the performance of Chinese stocks, which enjoyed their best day in more than three years Monday, with the blue-chip CSI 300 index rising nearly 6 percent.

The president’s cancellation of the tariff hike stirred worries among some supporters, who fear he will abort his confrontation with China and settle for a weak deal.

AD

Trump said Sunday that negotiators had made “substantial progress” on core structural issues, including intellectual-property protection and compulsory technology licensing requirements for U.S. businesses in China. But administration officials have provided no details, and business leaders who have been briefed on the talks say a yawning gap still separates the two sides.

AD

“What has me shaking my head is this move to give away perhaps our greatest point of leverage in the talks without getting anything in return,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. “I don’t count this as a win for American workers.”

Michael Stumo, head of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, said Trump is heeding advisers who prioritize financial market considerations.

AD

“The Wall Street and globalist wing of the administration seem to be pushing for a short-term deal that we know will not be sufficient for our long-term interests,” he said.

Weakness in both countries’ manufacturing industries may be motivating the American and Chinese presidents to seek a deal, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, a financial research firm.

Earlier this month, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank’s manufacturing gauge sank to its lowest level in nearly three years, while a separate measure, the flash purchasing managers’ index, posted its worst mark in 17 months.

AD

Chinese industrial benchmarks likewise have disappointed.

That helps explain Chinese state media’s applause for Trump’s concession on his planned tariff increase, a move that is viewed as averting an increasingly damaging commercial conflict.

The two sides are inching “closer to reaching a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement,” said China’s state-owned Xinhua news service.

“The extension of the latest round of negotiations and the delaying tariff increase on Chinese imports testify to the sincerity, high attention and sense of urgency of both the Chinese and U.S. sides,” Xinhua reported. “Yet they also indicate that there are still some differences that need more time to be ironed out.”

The U.S. trade deficit with China is expected to have grown to more than $400 billion in 2018, a record.

AD

The question now is whether the trade deal between the two countries will amount to pledges from China to buy more American products, such as soybeans and liquefied natural gas, to narrow that gap, or whether the Trump administration can persuade Beijing to embark on painful structural reforms.

AD

The two nations met for a seventh round of talks last week, the third in a month, to try to make headway.

Trump’s Sunday night tweet on tariffs showed how far apart the two remain, said James Zimmerman, an American lawyer in Beijing and former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.

“The tariff postponement simply means that both sides realize that they are nowhere near a viable deal, and to avoid a showdown later this week, they need some breathing room,” he said.

Last week, the president suggested that the dispute over Huawei Technologies, the world’s largest communications equipment manufacturer, was also part of the discussion. Asked if he would consider dropping criminal charges against Huawei as part of a deal, Trump said Friday that he would discuss the issue with the attorney general and U.S. attorneys"

DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH
Docket No. 74333.
Michigan Court of Appeals.
Decided January 3, 1985.
Glotta, Adelman, Dinges & Riley, P.C. (by Chui Karega), for plaintiff.
Frank J. Kelley, Attorney General, Louis J. Caruso, Solicitor General, and George L. McCargar and Thomas R. Wheeker, Assistants Attorney General, for defendant.
Before: DANHOF, C.J., and GRIBBS and R.M. SHUSTER,[*] JJ.
PER CURIAM.
Plaintiff, an employee of Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital (a division of the Department of Mental Health), was injured in July, 1979, when a patient at the hospital assaulted him. He received workers' compensation benefits coordinated with ""assault pay"" pursuant to § 113 of the Mental Health Code, MCL 330.1113; *104 MSA 14.800(113). In December, 1979, however, plaintiff's workers' compensation benefits were terminated. Defendant thereafter terminated plaintiff's benefits under § 113, since that section provides that supplemental benefits shall only be paid as long as an employee is receiving workers' compensation benefits.
From July, 1979, to December, 1979, plaintiff was on leave of absence from his position at Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital. In December, 1979, plaintiff requested an extension of that leave of absence, claiming he was still unable to return to work. An extension was granted until March, 1980. At the expiration of that extension, another extension was sought by plaintiff, but it was denied and plaintiff was separated from his employment when he did not return to work.
Thereafter, in April, 1980, plaintiff filed a petition for hearing with the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation. On February 17, 1981, defendant was ordered to pay workers' disability compensation benefits to plaintiff, 70% of which plaintiff received during the pendency of the appeal from that decision, pursuant to MCL 418.862; MSA 17.237(862); however, no supplemental ""assault pay"" benefits were paid. Plaintiff's entitlement to workers' compensation benefits is presently pending in a separate appeal and is not at issue here. At issue is plaintiff's entitlement to ""assault pay"".
At the time plaintiff was terminated, he failed to file a grievance challenging his separation from employment. Accordingly, upon defendant's motion for accelerated judgment, the Court of Claims held that plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and, therefore, was precluded from bringing suit in the Court of Claims. The Court of Claims also intimated that it was without *105 jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff's claim, i.e., that the circuit court was the proper forum to contest a claim for ""assault pay"". This appeal has ensued.
MCL 330.1113; MSA 14.800(113) provides as follows:

887,5,16031,"Abdication of Wilhelm II

Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia in November 1918. The abdication was announced on 9 November  by Prince Maximilian of Baden and was formally enacted by Wilhelm's written statement on 28 November, made while in exile in Amerongen, the Netherlands. This ended the House of Hohenzollern's 500-year rule over Prussia and its predecessor state, Brandenburg. Wilhelm ruled Germany and Prussia from 15 June 1888 through 9 November 1918, when he went into exile. Following the abdication statement and German Revolution of 1918–19, the German nobility as a legally defined class was abolished. On promulgation of the Weimar Constitution on 11 August 1919, all Germans were declared equal before the law. Ruling princes of the constituent states of Germany also had to give up their monarchical titles and domains, of which there were 22. Of these princely heads of state, four held the title of king (König) (the kings of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Württemberg), six held the title of grand duke (Großherzog), five held the title of duke (Herzog), and seven held the title prince (i.e., sovereign prince, Fürst).

Abdication negotiations

After the Oberste Heeresleitung stated the German front was about to collapse and asked for immediate negotiation of an armistice, the cabinet of Chancellor Georg von Hertling resigned on 30 September 1918. Hertling, with the support of Haußmann, Oberst  and Erich Ludendorff suggested Prince Maximilian of Baden as his successor and to have Wilhelm II appoint Maximilian as Chancellor of Germany and minister president of Prussia. When Maximilian arrived in Berlin on 1 October, Emperor Wilhelm II convinced him to take the post and appointed him on 3 October 1918. The message asking for an armistice went out on 4 October, hopefully to be accepted by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson. In late October, Wilson's third note seemed to"

To investigate whether these four miRNAs could also function as potential biomarkers for mechanical unloading osteoporosis, we detected them in the serum of rhesus monkeys with or without 42 days' bedrest. As shown in [Fig. 4c](#f4){ref-type=""fig""}, miR-30b-5p, miR-103-3p and miR-142-3p were significantly down-regulated after bedrest, while miR-328-3p had no significant change. And the ROC analysis ([Fig. 4d](#f4){ref-type=""fig""}) showed considerable diagnostic value: 0.926 for miR-30b-5p (95% CI = 0.67--1.00, p \< 0.0001), 0.796 for miR-103-3p (95% CI = 0.52--0.96, p = 0.0133), 0.950 for miR-142-3p (95% CI = 0.68--1.00, p \< 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity evaluated with optimal cutoff points were shown in [Table 2](#t2){ref-type=""table""}.

Discussion
==========

The expression patterns of circulating miRNAs have been shown to correlate with the occurrence and progression of human diseases[@b8][@b25]. Recently, the diagnostic potential of circulating miRNAs for postmenopausal osteoporosis has been investigated and some miRNAs were identified as potential biomarkers[@b10][@b12][@b13][@b14]. Because of the diverse study designs and models, more studies were required to establish circulating miRNAs biomarkers for osteoporosis with high specificity and sensitivity. For example, no comprehensive investigation on reference genes for osteoporosis has been performed which is indispensable for quantitative analysis.

In the present study, we first filtered candidate reference genes in HU osteoporosis model using miRNAs microarray and qPCR validation. miR-25-3p was recommended as the most suitable reference gene according to the ranking of 9 candidate miRNAs by two statistical algorithms (geNorm and NormFinder). To extend its application scope, we further estimated the stability of miR-25-3p in various osteoporosis models and species. Osteoporosis is a systematic skeletal disease caused by complex causes, including estrogen deficiency which mainly occurred in postmenopausal women and mechanical unloading owing to long-duration bedrest or exposure to microgravity[@b26][@b27].

Migrating Off COBOL and Adding AI

By Michael Crutcher and Monte Zweben

For decades, Mainframes have anchored industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare, retail, as well as the public sector. All of these industries require heavy-duty low latency transaction processing. Mainframes are designed to provide mission-critical applications with high availability, where downtime would be extremely costly or simply unacceptable.

But mainframe applications are being left behind as businesses strive to transform using distributed computing and public clouds. In large part, this is due to the perception that it’s overwhelming, even impossible, to modernize a mainframe application.

This perception is misguided. New technologies have lowered the barriers to mainframe modernization and deliver several key benefits, including cost reduction, business agility, and unlocking new AI application capabilities. Let’s investigate each of these gains.

Cost Reduction

Modernizing mainframe-powered applications to use inexpensive commodity hardware significantly lowers upfront mainframe capital expenditures as well as ongoing licensing and maintenance costs. Migrating to the cloud definitely provides unique benefits, but many customers with mainframe workloads also happen to have underutilized on-premises clusters that can be utilized to house modernized mainframe workloads. Mainframe application modernization that results in a containerized solution can often provide the best of both worlds. A Kubernetes approach, for example, can provide a pathway for abstracting away the underlying infrastructure and deploying it on-premises or in the cloud, acting as a bridge between the two options with little or no modification.

Business Agility

Migrating mainframe workloads to the Cloud results in greater business agility. Containerization makes applications significantly more agile because it allows applications to be deployed quickly and resized to accommodate changing infrastructure needs on-demand. It can be exploited both in the cloud or on-premises. Containerizing on-premises apps enables customers to amortize their existing infrastructure investments while providing a fast path to the cloud. The cloud offers pay-as-you-go pricing and easy access to a wide variety of computing infrastructure without the need for IT teams to support a vast number of potential hardware configurations.

Migrating off mainframes also provides a path to a more modern database that enables applications to horizontally scale out to accommodate a more substantial amount of data. It also enhances performance and concurrency by spreading existing data and workloads across unlimited commodity servers. Splice Machine (where I’m a co-founder and CEO) is an"

After successfully procuring pledges from the likes of Levi Strauss, Nike, and Zara to detox their products and supply chains by 2020, Greenpeace has a new target in its sights: Gap. The environmental nonprofit has penned an open letter to the apparel retailer, which also owns the Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, and Athleta brands, urging it to stop “sponsoring” toxic water pollution in China, Mexico, and, most recently, Indonesia, where one of its suppliers, PT Gistex Group, was caught releasing a multicolored cocktail of hormone-disrupting chemicals into the local water supply.

NOT SO BRIGHT

Despite test results that consistently reveal the presences of hazardous substances in Gap-branded apparel, the company has so far “systematically failed to prevent these environmental and human injustices from persisting,” according to Greenpeace.

Below, Greenpeace’s letter to Gap in full:

Glenn Murphy
Chief Executive Director
Gap Inc.

Last week, Greenpeace International released an investigation revealing how a facility in Indonesia was releasing a cocktail of hazardous chemicals – including nonylphenol, antimony and tributyl phosphate—and pH 14 wastewater directly into a local water system that millions of people depend upon for their drinking water and livelihoods.

This facility is owned by PT Gistex Group, a supplier that Gap Inc. has a business relationship with—a fact that has been acknowledged by your team.

This is not the first time that Gap Inc. has been found to be conducting business with a polluting supplier. In China and Mexico investigations also revealed links between Gap and suppliers releasing toxic chemicals into the local waterways.

And the problem gets worse.

Investigations into Gap-branded clothing also revealed that 78 percent of the items tested contained traces of nonylphenol ethoxylate—a hazardous chemical that breaks down to form an even more toxic and hormone-disrupting substance when released into rivers, lakes and seas.

The presence of this chemical in Gap clothing items indicates that hazardous substances were both used and released in the manufacture of these garments, meaning that the pollution found in China, Mexico and Indonesia are not isolated cases. It also means that your own customers have been forced to become unwitting accomplices in the toxic water cycle, helping to spread these hormone-disrupting substances when they wash their clothes.

Toxic water pollution is impacting millions of people around the world.

Some of these people have decided that enough is enough, and are making their voices heard in traditional media, online, at the source of the pollution, and outside your stores.

These people are not just activists and members of affected communities, but also people from within the fashion world, and your very own fans and consumers.

These are people united by two common beliefs; that beautiful fashion shouldn’t cost the earth, and that we all have a right to know what chemicals are in the garments we buy and in the water that we all share.

After all, the clothes we wear should have a story we can be proud of.

Whatsapp database decryption on Android

I'd like to write an Android Application which automatically decrypts my Whatsapp Database, so I followed this tutorial and translated it into Java. But then I noticed that there is no openssl binary on Android so I asked google how to decrypt aes manually but I could not find something useful.
So basically I got this shell command 
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -nosalt -nopad  -bufsize 16384 -in msgstore.db.crypt7.nohdr -K $k -iv $iv > msgstore.db

with $k being a 64 digit hex-string. But when I tried to use it as the key for the aes decryption I get an InvalidKeyException with the message ""Unsupported key size: 64 bytes"".
When I execute this command at my computer I works perfectly.
I am currently using this java code to decrypt the database and it fails at cipher.init:
public void decryptDatabase(String k, String iv)

Ask HN: Resources on how to build internal/enterprise tools? - internal_tools
There is a lot of attention given to consumer facing tools and how to build an MVP for that market segment. But what if your customer is internal (or a known enterprise)? Are there any good resources that discuss strategies on building these tools?<p>It seems like there is a lot of knowledge out there, as every company I have worked for has teams for internal tooling -- but very little public or communal knowledge.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s because the problem isn&#x27;t as &quot;sexy&quot; as consumer tooling and products?

Hi, Have some experience in this area. As we often build apps that are used
internally for customers.

What @selmet said hits the nail on the head

""From my experience, requirements don't come from bottom but it should.
Initiator is almost always manager who might have some idea or vision but it's
not right originator.""

Having said that, the same principals that apply for ""consumer apps"" would
apply to internal enterprise tools.

Here is some of what i do when consulting:

\- Start with ""what is the problem you are trying to solve?, what are you
trying to achieve?""

\- Is the envisioned tool/app/software going to actually solve this problem?

\- How can we get more data to validate or disprove this?

\- What are the minimum set of features needed (MVP) to get it in front of
users?

\- If the sponsor/initiator is not the actual person the software is targeted
or is far removed from the actual problem. Speak to the actual users on the
ground, the people who are trying to solve this every day. Effectively do
customer dev with them (from startup world)

\- Depending on the organization, you may find some resistance if you focus on
user needs. This is usually driven by ""bigger pay checks = better opinions""
type thinking. What you need to do here is get people to understand the
problem, and how the features being added are specifically towards solving
them and nothing else.

The knowledge gained, and paradigm shift you get having been in a startup,
even a failed one is tremendously useful. You will find when you get into more
traditional enterprise you are thinking different to most people there, you
see things in a different light. Always looking for the quickest path to
validate, and ensure you are heading in the right direction.

I find building toward ease data entry and access - not what looks pretty

Make entry as easy as possible text entry for times & dates - with a tooltip
calendar, (unnecessary pop-up lists are a pain for anything when entering
bunches of records.) Consider using chekboxes and radio lists for selection
over popuplists sometimes they provide visual cues easier then reading or
expanding a popup.

Reduce complex multi-table entry forms to one screen, same with displaying
data... Make it so in reports where you might need to correct entry staff can
click right to record edit instead of having to back out, etc.

Try to make every bit of data collected usable, don't just have a ""office
hours"" field have a schedule entry so you can draw on the data - down the road
someone will say, I saw you collect X, can we use that to do Y? Be prepared to
say ""no problem.""

Another big thing on internal/enterprise apps is access and administrative
tools. As a lot of people are working on your data some only have limited
program access, or access to only certain datasets... also others can check on
activity of how the data is entered/accessed/updated, might also be some sort
of job logging going on.

Initiator is almost always manager who might have some idea or vision but it's
not right originator. And this is the main issue. He is trying to remove
outward manifestation not root cause. Employees are always struggling with
deeper issues than manager is trying to solve.

907,13,29139,"Immigration policy was on the national agenda in February as the political system responded to a reform plan released by a bipartisan group of eight senators, and President Barack Obama highlighted immigration in his February 12 State of the Union address. The month’s media coverage gives us a glimpse of what to expect from the public debate as the immigration issue takes center stage—and it’s far from reassuring.

Extra! analyzed immigration reform coverage in the Nexis news media database for all ABC, CBS and NBC news programs, as well as the PBS NewsHour, CNN’s Situation Room, Fox News’ Special Report and MSNBC’s Hardball for the full month. The study found 54 reports pertaining to immigration policy, featuring a total of 157 sources.

The majority of sources from all networks were white male politicians born in the United States without personal ties to immigration. The voices of immigrants or activists were mostly absent.

In recent years, more than 50 percent of all immigrants living in the U.S. were women, and in 2011, “55 percent of all people obtaining a green card were women” (Center for American Progress, 3/8/13). Women are also highly underrepresented among the high-tech workers Congress wants to make room for, and over-represented in informal sector jobs like domestic work, which could pose greater obstacles to obtaining the documentation necessary for the proposed path-way to citizenship (Huffington Post, 4/4/13).

Despite the evident impact immigration reform will have on women—in addition to the fact that they constitute roughly 50 percent of the population, immigrant or not—women’s voices were largely missing from the media debate. Out of 157 sources, just 19 were women (12 percent).

MSNBC’s Hardball managed to record the highest proportion of women (25 per-cent), though this only represented three female sources, due to Hardball’s more limited coverage. NBC had the highest number of female sources—six—but this still fell far short of its 31 male sources. Both Fox News’ Special Report and the PBS NewsHour had a single female source: U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.

Immigrants come from every part of the world. In 2011, 53 percent of U.S. immigrants were from Latin America, 29 percent were from Asia and the Middle East, 12 percent came from Europe and 4 percent were from Africa, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Despite the diverse backgrounds of immigrants, media sources for immigration policy discussions were much more homogenous, with 107 of them, or 68 percent, non-Latino whites.

Of 150 sources with identifiable ethnicity, 16 percent were Latinos and 11 percent were African-Americans. There were two South Asians (1 percent) and one Native American source (0.7 percent). No East Asian or Middle Eastern sources appeared.

But higher numbers for Latinos and African-Americans do not mean greater diversity of perspectives: Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida accounted for 14 of the 24 Latino appearances, while 12 of 16 African-American sources were President Obama. Without these two prominent politicians, the percentages for Latino and African-American sources would plummet to 7 percent and 3 percent, respectively.

At the intersection of gender and ethnicity, women of color were almost invisible in the discussion. Among 17 female sources whose ethnicity was identifiable, there was no one of Asian, Native American or Middle Eastern descent. Republican strategist Ana Navarro served as"

ENGEL: We`ve spoken to medical personnel. We`ve spoken to Syrian
activists in these areas where the attacks allegedly took place. Clearly,
something happened. They believe it was a chemical gas attack that around
2:30 in the morning there began a barrage of surface-to-surface rockets,
first firing into the eastern suburbs just outside of Damascus. That
lasted for about an hour with apartment buildings being hit.

Initially, people thought that it was just more of the standard shelling
that is very common place in the war in Syria as we`ve been seeing it.
Then, casualties started showing up in the field hospitals. People started
talking about chemical weapons attacks. Then, the casualties started
flooding in -- civilians, women, children, people who had been in those
apartment buildings.

After about an hour, the attacks shifted to the north, northern suburbs
just outside of Damascus, and a very similar pattern unfolding in those
same areas. We don`t exactly know the death toll. They range from
hundreds to well over 1,000.

But the kinds of stories, the kind of injuries, the kind of deaths that
were suffered are fairly consistent in the videos. We can`t authenticate
the videos because they were posted independently by people who are
supporting the revolution in Syria, but they seem quite -- they seem very
difficult to fake.

We`ve also shown them to independent experts, chemical weapons experts, who
thought they were consistent with a nonconventional weapons attack.

HAYES: So, what does this mean? The president has talked about a red line
and he`s been careful (INAUDIBLE) when discussing a red line to talk about
mass casualty events, to talk about systemic deployment. If we are seeing
something like this, if it is confirmed, it seems to me is the most
systemic mass attack, deployment of chemical weapons.

What does that mean for the red line the president has noted?

ENGEL: This would be a totally different scale of events. In the past,
we`ve talked about chemical weapons being used to kill one, two, five
people in numerous attacks. That always struck observers as a bit strange,
more of a terror tactic than a tactic of war -- using a limited amount of
chemical weapon to scare your enemy instead of creating mass casualties.

If this, in fact, is confirmed, this would be a different kind of attack.
Some of the rebels we`re talking about well over 1,000 killed. As you
mentioned in your intro, if that`s confirmed it`s one of the worst war
crimes, one of the worst atrocities carried out anywhere in decades.

The president talked about having a red line. If this is confirmed not
only is it crossed, that red line has been jumped over.

HAYES: NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel, thank you.

Joining me now is author, journalist and MSNBC contributor, Rula Jebreal.
Rula, you`ve spent some time with the rebels. We`ve talked about this
issue.

You and I have both been, I think it`s fair to say, skeptical of the
efficacy of U.S. intervention. What is your reaction to the images coming
out of Syria today?

RULA JEBREAL, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: This more than a red line. Richard Engel
is right. This is a moment we need to show the regime that something will
be done if he will continue. If he used these weapons, he has to be held
accountable.

This guy has to, not only leave. He has to relinquish power and he has to
actually give the U.N. access to all of these sites, because God knows who
can access these sites further. I mean, if it`s a failed state, you can
have anybody and we were -- as you said -- skeptical because there`s within
the Free Syrian Army there is an element that is very Islamist.

What if in case of failed state, there are these sites who have access to
these sites are this kind of Islamists. We need to intervene more now than
ever.

HAYES: What does -- OK, what does -- here is where I watch this and I
think two things, what we see today, again, if confirmed we have to say we
cannot verify the video but it does -- these circumstantial picture
certainly looks like something truly horrific.

Confucius ( ; 551–479 BC) was a Chinese philosopher and politician of the Spring and Autumn period.

The philosophy of Confucius, also known as Confucianism, emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice, kindness, and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era only to be suppressed in favor of the Legalists during the Qin dynasty. Following the victory of Han over Chu after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction in the new government and were further developed into a system known in the West as Neo-Confucianism, and later New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism).

Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the Chinese classic texts including all of the Five Classics, but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. Aphorisms concerning his teachings were compiled in the Analects, but only many years after his death.

Wagner looked closely at some of these schools. One, New City Christian School in Asheville, touted its ability to close the “achievement gap” between white and African-American students but provided parents with no ""truly comparable"" way to compare New City's performance to local schools.

Another school, Bethel Christian Academy in Kinston, “provides its students with an educational program that in its entirety, exalts and glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ by making Him the center of all things.”

The school uses textbooks that are “God-centered,” and Wagner observed, ""teach students Bible-based facts, including the following: dinosaurs and humans co-existed on Earth; slave-masters generally treated their slaves well; in some areas, the KKK fought the decline in morality by using the sign of the cross; and gay people have no more claims to special rights than child molesters or rapists.""

""If you are a gay student or interested in listening to or creating secular music,"" noted Wagner, ""that’s grounds for expulsion.""

How are parents, with children to educate, and citizens, who want to direct tax money toward the best interests of children, supposed to judge the ""value"" of these schools?

When Wagner approached public officials with the question, ""Where's the accountability?"" here is what she heard:

Rep. Marcus Brandon, a proponent of vouchers, told NC Policy Watch, “parents know what’s best for their children. If it’s a good school, parents will go there. And if it’s bad, parents won’t … The schools already have the accountability you could demand of a school because they work in the free enterprise system. If they don’t pride the product that meets the needs of the parents, those parents will vote with their feet … I had 38 schools close this year because they didn’t have the financial adequance to continue,” he added.

Where did the students go? “They dispersed and went to other schools. We don’t keep those records,” a North Carolina schools official said.

In other words, entrusting education to a voucher-driven market is mostly ""a guessing game,"" Wagner concluded – a ""guessing game"" perhaps for taxpayers, whose main risks are bad policy and wasted resources – but a whole lot worse for the parents and students involved whose failed gamble on a crapshoot school can cost an entire year of learning or more.

Shouldn't a responsible society do something to prevent that?

The national pursuit to gamble with our children's future

North Carolina is hardly alone in this roll out of crapshoot voucher schools.

In Oklahoma, for instance, that state's new school voucher program spends $1.6 million in state funds to send special needs students to private schools. However, only six of the 49 private schools currently accepting voucher money – 43 of which, by the way, are religious schools – ""specifically cater to students with special needs.”

Even traditional public schools are increasingly at risk to a crapshoot game of being opened and closed regardless of the effects on students.

918,28,7755,"Kelly is the chief of the U.S. Southern Command and was in Guantanamo this weekend, where more than 100 detainees are on a hunger strike demanding release
and closure of the detention centre.

His comments may be news to Kelly's commander-in-chief, President Barack Obama, who said in a national security address last month that he wanted Guantanamo closed and worried about its impact on the U.S.'s reputation. “Look at the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees
who are holding a hunger strike. Is that who we are?” Obama said. “Is that something that our Founders foresaw? Is that the America we want to leave to our children?”

So there's that term: force-feed.

Back to Kelly. What did he mean?

Rosenberg explains:

Hunger strikers who fall below a certain body weight are taken twice a
day to a feeding chair and given a choice — eat or have a tube snaked
up your nostril, down the back of your throat and have a can of Ensure
pumped inside.

“They’re all eating something,” Kelly said, adding
that some detainees in the prison supervised by Southcom will drink a
dose of Ensure through a straw rather than by the tube.

He called Guantanamo’s current protest a “Hunger Strike Lite.”

Is Kelly saying that detainees are willingly sipping Ensure? Their lawyers would disagree. Journalists can't verify exactly what is going on because access to the base is limited. It's a story, of course, if detainees are actually taking nutritional supplements without being restrained.

But read further into his comments and perhaps Kelly is talking semantics. It's not force-feeding, but he says what they are doing at Guantanamo is ""enterally feeding,"" hunger striking detainees, using the military term for the procedure.

Ah, Gitmo's war on words. Over the years this has been an issue raised repeatedly in our reporting on Guantanamo. Do not call it a prison, journalists have been told, because it's a ""detention centre."" Do not write that there are interrogations, because in fact questioning detainees is called ""reservations."" (That one was one of my favourites.) Suicides are ""asymmetric warfare.""

As George Orwell wrote in his 1946 essay, Politics and the English Language, ""political
language—and with variations this is true of all political parties, from
Conservatives to Anarchists—is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder
respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.""

So without evidence to show otherwise, this is what we know. The Pentagon reports that as of this morning, 39 detainees are being tube fed, call it what you will. Was the hunger strike an effort by the detainees to put Guantanamo back on the agenda? Undoubtedly so. Has it worked? Yes. Is Guantanamo closing? No, not in the near future. None of the detainees cleared for transfer have left the base since Obama's May 23 speech.

But Kelly's comments also raise another issue about where Gitmo will go from here.

“I cannot think of anything more horrible in the name of romance.” RT if U agree w/ @davenavarro! #SpeakOutForHorses pic.twitter.com/vGh1pmNeKL

Before he joined the Hugo Neu Corporation, a recycling company, as chief financial officer, in 2014, Nislick spent nearly forty years working at Edison Properties, a real estate development company owned by his cousin Jerry Gottesman. According to Politico New York, when Nislick started working for Edison Properties, in 1973, the family owned thirty parking lots. By the time Nislick retired, as CEO, in 2012, Edison owned more than two hundred lots and garages nationwide and had expanded its Manhattan Mini Storage brand across the country. Today, Edison owns twenty-one parking lots and seventeen storage locations in New York City.

As it happens, parking lots and garages are an exceptionally valuable asset in the Manhattan real estate market. A 2012 parking rate survey conducted by Colliers International found that the median monthly parking rates in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan were the highest in North America — $562 and $533, respectively. That is to say, rather than just letting a lot sit vacant until turning it into a luxury condo, residential developers can offset the cost of future construction by getting into the parking lot game. Or, having made money from the parking lot game, a developer might then get into residential, as Edison Properties did in 2007, when it began converting part of the parking lot at its 188 Ludlow Street location into a twenty-three-story, two-hundred-and-ten-thousand-square-foot, two-hundred-and-forty-three-unit mixed-use rental building. “2006 marks Edison’s 50th anniversary,” the company’s president, Gary DeBode, said in a statement. “Entering into residential development in this dynamic location is the perfect way to celebrate this milestone.” The celebrations continued as recently as this past fall, with Edison gobbling up properties throughout Hell’s Kitchen and the Far West Side.

Many in the carriage industry have suggested that Nislick may be more motivated by these business concerns than his affinity for animals: The current stables are all located in and around the area that Mayor Michael Bloomberg described, in a 2007 speech discussing plans to extend the 7 train to the still-developing Hudson Yards, as “the next Gold Coast of this city.” In the early days of de Blasio’s mayorality, Bob Knakal, the chairman of brokerage Massey Knakal Realty Services, told Bloomberg Business, “The highest and best use of this real estate is not as horse stables…The development rights are worth a heck of a lot more than the buildings currently there.” One carriage driver, Cornelius Byrne, who owns Central Park Carriage Stables and has become a prominent spokesperson for the industry, bought his stable in 1979 for less than $100,000. It’s currently valued at upwards of $8 million.

921,0,4098,"With all the talk about companies becoming more “agile” and outsourcing their IT operations to service providers, there's an interesting counter-trend starting to develop. While technology companies appear to be holding off on hiring because of economic fears, companies in sectors like healthcare and retail are moving to build their IT teams, in some cases reversing course on a strategy of outsourcing as much of their IT operations as possible.

Earlier this month, Best Buy announced that it would triple the size of the company's in-house IT staff by hiring 200 more tech professionals over the next year. Best Buy had largely outsourced IT operations, but the company's recently-hired CIO Jody Davis has reversed course. Davis told Retail Info System News, ""We now want [to hire] talent as Best Buy employees. We need to develop a strategy of what we're going to build. We like to take control of our destiny.""

Yes, many companies have shed services like e-mail, data center operations, and even desktop support to managed service providers, and have moved toward hiring IT contractors to handle application development and maintenance tasks—opting to focus on their “differentiators” to be more competitive. But over the past year, competition for IT skills has become increasingly fierce, and many companies are realizing that IT isn't just a support service—it's core to their business' future. And to take control of that future, HR professionals and recruiters say, more companies are looking to lock in IT professionals with the golden handcuffs of statutory employment.

Dheeraj Bharadwaj, human resources vice president at Atlanta-based IT solutions provider NIIT Technologies, told Ars that more companies are building up their internal IT staff and insourcing projects because they're looking for a more reliable and predictable pool of talent. Having a stronger internal IT team to lead projects “drives a high percentage of predictability in success,” he said, because “dependability, understanding of organization in quick judgments and knowledge of where to tap for resources are big advantages.”

For companies that have outsourced new projects or deferred projects entirely during the recession, the core IT staff “get hit by a feeling of saturation or stagnation due to repetitive work,” Bharadwaj said. “Due to the economy, very few organization have invested in new technology and projects, which are a great internal opportunity and tool to develop and retain talent.” By insourcing new projects instead of handing them off to contractors, companies can boost internal skills and avoid losing staff to the increasingly hot IT jobs market.

Scott Gordon, a partner at Vaco LLC, a Nashville-based tech recruiting firm, told Ars that there's a lot less discussion about outsourcing among his clients, and much more of a focus on internal hiring. He says he has seen an threefold increase in positions to be filled over the last"

927,27,11717,"The present invention is directed to a method for selecting a prey polypeptide that is able to interact with a bait polypeptide of interest, to a prey polynucleotide encoding the prey polypeptide as well as to the prey polypeptide itself. The invention also concerns plasmids used for performing the method of the invention as well as prokaryotic or eukaryotic recombinant host organisms containing such plasmids and also a collection of said recombinant host organisms consisting in a DNA library, such as a collection of recombinant haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally, the invention is also directed to a technical medium containing the whole information concerning the interactions between metabolically related bait and prey polypeptides and/or polynucleotides coding for bait and prey polypeptides.
Most biological processes involve specific protein-protein interactions. General methodologies to identify interacting proteins or to study these interactions have been extensively developed. Among them, the yeast two-hybrid system currently represents the most powerful in vivo approach to screen for polypeptides that could bind to a given target protein. Originally developed by Fields and coworkers [(Fields et al., 1989; Chien et al., 1991). Two U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,283,173 granted on Feb. 1, 1994 (Fields, S. and Song, O.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,614 granted on Nov. 21, 1995 (Fields, S. and Song, O.) herein incorporated by reference], the two-hybrid system utilizes hybrid genes to detect protein-protein interactions by means of direct activation of a reporter-gene expression (Allen et al., 1995; Transy et al., 1995). In essence, the two putative protein partners are genetically fused to the DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor and to a transcriptional activation domain, respectively. A productive interaction between the two proteins of interest will bring the transcriptional activation domain in the proximity of the DNA-binding domain and will trigger directly the transcription of an adjacent reporter gene (usually lacZ or a nutritional marker) giving a screenable phenotype. The transcription can be activated through the use of two functional domains of a transcription factor: a domain that recognizes and binds to a specific site on the DNA and a domain that is necessary for activation, as reported by Keegan et al. (1986) and Ma et al. (1987).
Recently, Rossi et al. (1997) described a different approach, a mammalian xe2x80x9ctwo-hybridxe2x80x9d system, which uses xcex2-galactosidase complementation (Ullmann et al., 1968) to monitor protein-protein interactions in intact eukaryotic cells.
The number of genome sequences of prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic host organisms available is increasing exponentially and there is a great need for new tools directed to the functional and global study of these newly characterized complete or partial genomes. As an illustrative example, the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is now completely sequenced (Goffeau et al., 1996).

Typically, such devices include a conductive blade or needle which serves as one electrode in an electrical circuit which is completed via a grounding electrode coupled to the patient. Incision of tissue is accomplished by applying a source of electrical energy (most commonly, a radio-frequency generator) to the blade. Upon application of the blade to the tissue, a voltage gradient is created, thereby inducing current flow and related heat generation at the point of contact. With sufficiently high levels of electrical energy, the heat generated is sufficient to cut the tissue and, advantageously, to simultaneously cauterize severed blood vessels.

Existence of M-types
--------------------

The crucial point of the proof that coinductive pretoposes are closed under the various constructions we are going to consider, will always be that of showing existence of M-types. The machinery to do so will be set up in this section.

Traditionally, one can recover non-well-founded trees from well-founded ones, whenever the signature has one specified constant. In fact, the constant allows for the definition of truncation functions, which cut a tree at a certain depth and replace all the term constructors at that level by that specified constant. The way to recover non-well-founded trees is then to consider sequences of trees $(t_n)_{n\gt 0}$ such that each $t_n$ is the truncation at depth $n$ of $t_m$ for all $m\gt n$. Each such sequence is viewed as the sequence of approximations of a given tree.

In our context, we call a map *pointed*, when the signature it represents has a specified constant symbol, i.e. if there exists a global element such that the following is a pullback:

The next two statements make clear that, instead of starting with well-founded trees, i.e. with the W-type for $f$, we can build these approximations from any fixed point of $P_f$.

[Mtypforpointedf]{} If for some pointed $f$ in, $P_f$ has a fixed point (that is, a (co)algebra for which the structure map is an isomorphism), then it also has a final coalgebra.

Assume $X$ is an algebra whose structure map is an isomorphism. Observe, first of all, that $X$ has a global element $$\func{\bot}{1}{X},$$ namely $\sup_{\bot}(t)$, where $\bot$ is the point of $f$ and $t$ is the unique map from $B_{\bot}=0$ to $X$.

Define, by induction, the following truncation functions : $$\begin{aligned}
    tr_0 & = & \bot \\
    tr_{n+1} & = & \sup\circ P_f(tr_n)\circ\textstyle{\sup^{-1}}
  \end{aligned}$$

Using these maps, we can define the object $M$, consisting of all sequences $(\alpha_n \in X)_{n \gt 0}$ with the property: $$\alpha_n = tr_n(\alpha_m) \textrm{ for all } n \lt m.$$

On $M$, we define a $P_f$-coalgebra structure as follows. Given a sequence $\alpha = (\alpha_n)\in M$, observe that $\rho(\alpha_n)$ is independent of $n$ and is some element $a
  \in A$. Hence, each $\alpha_n$ is of the form $\sup_a(t_n)$ for some, and we define by putting $t("

937,29,13673,"Obama no more founded the Islamic State than shopkeepers paying extortion money created the Mafia. Which, of course, would seem to have been Trump's actual point: That it was Obama's foreign policy that created the space for the Islamic State to gain power. Trump has made a similar argument before. At a rally in Mississippi in January, he claimed that ""Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama,"" in her position as secretary of state. In June, he said the same thing during a ""60 Minutes"" interview: Hillary Clinton invented the terror group.

The extent to which Obama deserves blame for allowing the Islamic State to expand in the months after the Syrian civil war began or credit for the United States' (belated) focus on the group is a subject best left to others. But, regardless, Trump later denied that was actually his point, which we'll get to. So let's instead focus on how Trump's rhetoric overlaps so poorly with his campaign effort.

Donald Trump likes to outrage. He prides himself on it. He's got the perfect excuse, rolled out a year ago this week: He's simply not ""politically correct."" He's not PC, he told Fox News' Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate last August, which is why he makes jokes about the physical appearance of women. Trump avoids the nuanced pronouncements of more experienced politicians and is clearly comfortable with being imprecise in how he makes his points. In his eyes, he's simply telling it like it is.

""All I do is tell the truth,"" he said during his interview with CNBC on Thursday. ""I am a truth-teller.""

939,6,7571,"Na mesma semana em que o Governo apresentou o Orçamento do Estado para 2020, o PCP faz pressão e propõe um plano de desenvolvimento do Metro do Porto para a próxima década que prevê a construção de seis novas linhas, numa extensão de 49 quilómetros de rede, num total de mais 54 estações. Nas contas do PCP, o valor estimado para esta obra é de cerca de 1500 milhões, sensivelmente metade do montante investido em toda a primeira fase da rede de metro do Porto.

A verba estimada para as linhas que o PCP propõe corresponde, no essencial, “ao valor que o Governo assumiu em 2008 investir no desenvolvimento da rede do metro. Não se trata de exigir nada de novo ou de extraordinário. Trata-se de reclamar do Estado português que honre compromissos que assumiu com esta região e as suas populações”, esclarece o PCP.

“A melhoria e alargamento da rede do Metro do Porto é vital opara o desenvolvimento da região, para a qualidade de vida e de trabalho da sua população e para a melhoria da mobilidade, com inegáveis vantagens económicas e ambientais”, afirmam os deputados do PCP num projecto de resolução que apresentaram esta quarta-feira na Assembleia da República e no qual recomendam ao Governo que “defina como prioritária para a resolução dos problemas de mobilidade da Área Metropolitana do Porto a criação de um audacioso plano de desenvolvimento do Metro do Porto na próxima década”.

O plano de desenvolvimento da rede do metropolitano foi apresentado esta quinta-feira, na estação do metro da Casa da Música, na Avenida de França, na Boavista, a metros do terreno para onde está projectado o El Corte Inglés e o término da futura linha Rosa, entre São Bento e a Avenida de França.

941,13,23386," meeting management tools.

[0007] While interactivity is generally a beneficial addition to a
conference or meeting, there are instances where interactivity may no
longer add to the user experience and can be a distraction. In addition,
a presenter at a meeting or conference may fear that too much interaction
distracts the attendees from the presentation. Thus, a meeting management
tool should give attendees and presenters a choice in the level of
interaction that they desire.

[0008] Conventionally, meeting management tools may be expensive,
elaborate, or difficult to use. In addition, meeting management tools
required a laptop computer, a connection to a designated network, and a
special piece of software or data that must be downloaded and installed
before the conference begins. Under this conventional paradigm, attendees
may forget to install the conference software or data before the
conference begins. If an attendee cannot access the conventional meeting
management tools, their conference experience might be diminished
throughout. Alternatively, an attendee may spend the early portion of the
conference attempting to resolve their lack of preparation by installing
the conference software after the conference begins, thereby missing
important information delivered at the beginning of the conference. Also,
conventional meeting management tools may hinder a presenter and delay a
conference while the presenter attempts to resolve technology issues.
Also conducting a meeting without technology may burden a presenter in
many ways, for example, a presenter may need to print and distribute
meeting notes, update program agendas, and update these materials
whenever a change is made. Thus, an on-demand tool that requires no
set-up time is desired for conference attendees and presenters. This
on-demand tool should also be simple and easy to use so the user may
interact without missing important conference material.

[0009] Also, conference attendees may be burdened by carrying a laptop
computer to a conference, so many attendees may rely only on more mobile
devices, like tablets and smart phones. Thus, a conference collaboration
tool that functions on mobile technology for attendee convenience is
desired.

[0010] The presenter, presenter assistant, or hosting entity may desire to
acquire analytical information from the attendees at a conference or
event such as name, email address, events attended, and application
usage. Thus, a conference collaboration tool that consumes information
regarding the attendees and their experiences is desired.

SUMMARY

[0011] The systems and methods described herein attempt to overcome the
drawbacks discussed above by providing a web-based conference
collaboration tool that provides dynamic content pertinent to an
attendee's conference. The conference collaboration tool of the exemplary
embodiments runs on mobile devices, such as a tablet or a smart phone,
and more specifically, may use a web browser to access the dynamic
content. When the conference collaboration tool runs on mobile
technology, the conference collaboration tool can generate different
views and formats depending on whether the attendee accessed the
conference collaboration tool with a smart phone or a tablet and based on
the operating system of an attendee's device. The conference
collaboration tool also provides different content, data, and privileges
to different users depending on their role. The conference collaboration
tool provides attendees to a live, in-person conference dynamic content
and interactivity during the conference, such as chat service, documents
view, notifications, and surveys.

[0012] In one embodiment, a conference collaboration system comprises a
server connected to a network and configured to generate a page view
requested by a client device over the network and provide dynamic content
associated with the requested page view for display on a browser of the
client device; and a database connected to the server configured to store
the dynamic content, update the dynamic content in response to commands
from the server, and provide the dynamic content to the server in
response to requests from the server, wherein the dynamic content is
associated with a plurality of services, each service is shown in a page
view, and the dynamic content and the services are"

Thrill&Kill: Apparently, F is “based on true events”. Nowadays a lot of films seem to be based on true events and sometimes those real events are really far away. I could imagine things like we see in F happening in reality, but how much of it is really true and what were the real events?
Johannes Roberts: Ha actually I think it was only the UK cinema trailer that claimed that – we certainly never did on the film. I think it was just a marketing ploy. However in one sense it is true. Before I made F I was a teacher in the very place we shot F. All the characters are based on people I worked with. I never saw much violence but I did see a lot of examples of beurocracy gone crazy which was where the idea of F came from. It’s funny because one of the criticisms I often get from F was the lack of motivation of the children. Some people really found it unrealistic that this kind of thing would happen without a reason and then we had the London Riots a couple of months back. It was like a real life version of F.

T&K: F reminded me a bit of John Carpenter’s ASSAULT, although it’s not gangsters and a police station but teenagers and a school, but also of EDEN LAKE, where kids kill adults. Did you have any obvious influences or are all similarities coincidence?Johannes Roberts: F is very much influenced by Assault which is one of my favorite films. It deals with very similar themes – like Assault F could be a western – with the group of characters trapped in a fort / school fighting off hordes of faceless Indians / kids. Also what attracted me to the idea of F and what I loved about Assault is the idea of a character out of time with the world around him. Like Napoleon Wilson Anderson is totally out of step with the world he now finds himself in. Oddly Eden Lake often gets bought up when people talk about F but it really has very little to do with it. I found that film well made but very empty and mean spirited.

T&K: While I liked the fact, that the film tells us little about the background of the hooded killers, other people complained about this. Can you give them some hints?Johannes Roberts: The film is not about the kids attacking the school but about a broken man totally out of step with the current time who has to desperately try and get his daughter back. I loved the idea of a teacher who was terrified of children. How must it be to do a job your entire life then suddenly after one event (the head butt) to become terrified of them. I’ve heard some wonderful suggestions on who the kids are. I really left it up to the audience. I know who they are but I wasn’t interested in doing a reveal. F is all about that end. About the decision Anderson has to make. The whole film leads up to it. I know it drove a lot of people mad but I absolutely adore it.

T&K: The killers don’t speak, we don’t see their faces and they seem to be extremely athletic. Is there a deeper meaning behind this?Johannes Roberts: I was really influenced by Asian horror. I love ghost stories and supernatural films. F is far more influenced by films like The Grudge and The Ring than films like Eden Lake or The strangers. In many ways I was shooting with the conventions of a ghost story which I think threw a lot of people.

T&K: The film was shot on limited budget. Was there anything you could not include, because it was too expensive or is everything just the way you planned it?Johannes Roberts: Yeah we had no money at all. The film was written to be done that way so I never felt I had to compromise. Some people complained about the lack of on screen kills but again it wasn’t really a budget thing it was the asian ghost story influence where you see the aftermath and then have to imagine what the hell did that to the person – it is so much creepier.

T&K: You are British and so is the film. What would you say separates a British (horror) movie from an American (horror) movie?Johannes Roberts: Hard to say really. I am very influenced by American horror movies. I think the independence from a studio and ability to make films on smaller budgets means we can be more original. I never would have got away with that ending and the lack of answers in a studio movie.

T&K: In your career you have done several horror-movies. Are you a fan of the genre and"

954,15,5411,"Cheerio King Rio

So the dreaded day has finally arrived. No matter how long we saw it coming, Rio Ferdinand’s exit from Manchester United has hit home hard. The elegant defender who formed the foundation upon which the club embarked on its most successful era retires after 12 years of service to Man United. And boy will we miss him.

The day Rio arrived at United in that hideous white suit is a day I remember quite vividly. We were signing one of the world’s best defenders for big money and I was embarking on a personal milestone having accessed the internet for the very first time to confirm his arrival. I took to him instantly. His effortless stride and graceful defending in a role known for its aggression made it look cool to be a defender. He could defend alright but he was equally comfortable with the ball at his feet. Like every kid, I wanted to be an attacker but watching Rio strut his stuff with such class made me switch to a defender. ‘I could play ball at the back too,’ I thought. My people from Highie can attest to this.

He sure did love celebrating our goals. Bless him (image c/o MEN)

What made Rio stand out among the world’s best defenders was his incredible ability to read the game, anticipate the opponents next move and move in quickly to avert the danger. There was no last ditch tackles, no mud or grass marks on his shorts, no fouls, cards, nothing. Rio would simply position himself perfectly to neutralize the opposition with an interception or shepherd the opponent away from goal without the need to resort to a tackle. A simple interception that didn’t come with the thunderous applause a tackle would generate but more effective. Preventive rather than curative. Pre-emptive, not reactive. His style meant that he rarely conceded a foul, let alone a caution. Amazingly, he once went 4515 minutes – close to 2 years of football – without getting a yellow card and averaged a foul once every 811 minutes played or one foul every nine games! That was Rio for you, earning the nickname ‘the interceptacon’ for his defensive style. He truly was a transformer.

But as you would have it, fans tend to appreciate the physicality and perceived commitment that comes with crunching tackles. To that effect, Rio’s defensive partner Vidic was the more popular defender with the fans. And supremely talented as he was, Rio could also be quite a dick at times with his off-pitch antics. His missed drug test, holding the club at ransom when negotiating a new contract shortly after the 8 month ban when the club stood by him and his goofy character on social media somewhat watered down his on-pitch excellence.

But all this did little to tarnish Rio’s image in my eyes. He has undoubtedly been United’s most important player during the last decade. He led from the back whether he had the armband or not and was one of the several leaders you need in a team if it is to be successful. Having Vidic by his side and Van de Saar behind him further fortified United’s impregnable defence. Lesser opponents were easily vanquished while greater enemies would more often than not suffer defeat when they attempted to lay siege on fortress United. I’ll forever remember his display during the Champions League semifinal win over Barcelona in 2008 on our way to Moscow. That he rivaled CR7 as the club’s player of the year when Ronaldo won the World Player of the Year in 2008 tells you all you need to know about how good he was at his peak.

As he aged, Rio lost some of his pace but this had little effect on his performances as he compensated for it with excellent positioning and anticipation. A few speedy players gave him difficult games but this was the exception rather than the norm. He overcame back problems and premature obituaries to have one of his best seasons in 2012-13. In hindsight, he should have gone out on a high with Fergie and not have the annus horribilis at the sunset of his career. But as someone mentioned, he had one last in getting the hapless Moyes out of our club.

As another illustrious United chapter comes to an end – and they’ve been quite a number lately – I’m left reminiscing"

957,6,15058,"PRINCETON, NJ -- Americans' perceptions of 20 nations that figure prominently in the news or U.S. foreign policy held quite steady in the first year of the Obama administration. Canada retained its top position in Gallup's annual country ratings, with 90% of Americans viewing it favorably, unchanged from 2009. Iran continues to rank last, with 10% this year.

Eight of the countries rated in this year's World Affairs survey are viewed favorably by a majority of Americans. Great Britain nearly matches Canada in favorability, while smaller majorities hold positive views of Germany, Japan, Israel, India, France, and Egypt. Mexico and Russia are both about as likely to be viewed unfavorably as favorably, while 10 countries are generally viewed unfavorably.

""Although the two-percentage-point decline in Mexico's overall favorable rating between 2009 and today is not significant, the result is that, for the first time since 1993, fewer than half of Americans have a favorable view of the United States' southern neighbor.""

Yemen was included on the list for the first time this year, amid news that the Christmas Day underwear bomber had ties to a Yemen-based al Qaeda terrorist group. Its 21% favorable rating is among the lowest in the Feb. 1-3 poll, although about one in four Americans have no opinion of that country.

Only Iraq saw a statistically significant, albeit small, drop in favorability over the past year on the basis of the combined percentages viewing each ""very favorably"" or ""mostly favorably."" Most countries' ratings are essentially unchanged, while favorability toward Russia and the Palestinian Authority is up slightly.

Partial Rebound in Views of Russia

After dipping to 40% in 2009 -- most likely in response to the 2008 military conflict between Russia and Georgia -- favorability toward Russia has recovered somewhat to 47%; however, this remains lower than where it stood for much of the past decade.

The historical high point for positive U.S. feelings toward Russia was 66%, first reached in 1991 and repeated in 2002. However, favorability toward Russia plummeted to 41% in March 2003, after that country sharply opposed the United States' launching of the Iraq war. (U.S. public opinion of France and Germany, two other countries opposed to the war, also turned more negative in 2003.) By February 2004, Russia's favorability score was back to 59%, and it remained above 50% until 2008.

Palestinian Authority Sees Slight Improvement

Americans' views of the official governing body of the Palestinian people -- the Palestinian Authority -- have been decidedly negative over the years. However, there was a slight improvement in views over the past year, from 15% viewing the Palestinian Authority favorably in 2009 (and just 11% after the Hamas group won the Palestinian elections in 2006) to 20% today.

Favorability toward the Palestinian Authority was quite low for most of the Bush administration, except for February 2005, when the two sides had just announced an informal truce during Mideast peace talks.

Favorability Toward Mexico Still Dampened

959,11,15332,"Credit card debt has become a big financial albatross for many American families. According to the Federal Reserve Survey on Consumer Finance over 176 million credit cardholders exist in the United States. This is an amazing figure when you actually think about what a credit card is. A credit card essentially allows you to spend money you do not have today on the promise you will pay it off tomorrow. We constantly hear how great it is to have credit cards to build credit as long as you pay off your balance each month. The data tells us something very different from this ideal utopia vision of credit card debt. The average credit card debt per household with a credit card balance is close to $16,000. Given that some households have little credit card debt, you can imagine how high the debt is for others. A big part of our economy was built on the back of credit card debt. Because of the massive deleveraging experienced by Americans, credit card debt has now contracted by $171 billion since the recession began. What happens when the credit card bill comes home?

Credit card debt trends

The apex of revolving debt in the US was hit in 2008 when the recession was raging at a full pace. Over $970 billion in credit card debt was hit at this point:

Keep in mind that this $970+ billion in credit card debt was being carried over from previous months. In other words, people that do not pay off their credit card debt balance in full. This deleveraging in credit card debt is truly a once in a generation type event:

Going back to data from 1968 there wasn’t one year where year-over-year credit card debt fell in the United States. So to see a 17 percent contraction in revolving credit is a monumental event. For the US household something akin to a peak event in debt was reached. And is it any wonder? The average debt for US household is roughly $78,000:

The above figures are even more startling when you realize that the per capita income is $25,000. Even using the median household income of $50,000 we realize that many households are significantly leveraged for years, even decades to come. Why else would credit card debt contract so severely after nearly half a century of unimpeded growth? You also need to examine the younger household debt and how much of it is now being replaced by student loan debt. The college debt bubble will burst at some point as student loan debt surges to roughly $1 trillion in 2012.

Part of it has to also do with the high interest rates charged by credit card institutions:

Source: CreditCards.com

So take the typical household with credit card debt at $16,000 and assume they only pay the minimum amount each month. If they are only covering the interest, at the national average rate, they are paying roughly $200 a month without having one cent going to the initial principal. This is why credit card debt can become so troublesome for many Americans and essentially a transfer of wealth from the majority to a few giant financial institutions with access to cheap readily available funding.

While a good number of credit card debt is being paid off, a large amount is being paid off by bankruptcy. This isn’t exactly the kind of deleveraging that is healthy. When people look at the mortgage debt stalling out they fail to examine the fact that a giant portion of this was because of forced deleveraging via the 5,000,000 or so completed foreclosures since the recession hit. Nothing can clear mortgage debt faster than simply not paying your mortgage and giving the house back to the bank"

964,26,16541,", really complicated to implement? Or vaguely sensible?

Write caching alone would be wonderful, but it'd also be a stepping stone toward coalescing writes into fewer bigger operations and finally getting rid of any need for hardware RAID controllers...

The easiest way to make use of some sort of fast-but-small storage (such as RAM drives) is to configure your filesystem with an external journal on the RAM drive and turn on data journalling.

That way everything gets written to the RAM drive first, which has very low latency, and then gets written to store large/slow storage (e.g. RAID6) at a more sedate pace but with no-one waiting for it (unless memory gets tight etc).

I have used this to get good performance on an NFS server (which needs very low latency in it's storage subsystem) and it worked quite well. There was at the time (8 years ago?) room for improvement in ext3's handling of data journalling but I managed to tune it to do quite well. The issues I hit might be fixed now.

This addresses most of what you want from a RAM drive but not quite everything. The one thing it doesn't do is close the 'write hole'. If you crash and come up with a degraded array (or the array goes degraded before a resync finishes) you can get silent corruption. This is virtually never a problem in real life, but it would be nice to fix it and the only credible fix is to journal to a v.fast device. And if you are going to journal to a v.fast device, you get all the other low-latency benefits for free. (This of course assumes that your low-latency device has very good ECC codes so the chance of data loss in there is virtually zero).

Add this to md/raid5 would certainly not be trivial"

I think the mining change makes perfect sense especially when you consider the change that was made to blacksmithing. I wonder if we'll keep seeing more changes to profession leveling similar to the changes already in place. I'm thinking maybe alchemy or inscription because of the herbilism changes.

Sometimes I am not sure that Blizzard really knows what they are doing.

They identify a problem that the old world zones are empty and they go to the trouble to try and fix it with CRZ. CRZ works and the old world feels much better.

Now with these profession changes and what they did with Blacksmithing are going to reduce the nos in the old world and we are going to be back to square one.

It doesn't make sense.

how is CRZ ""working""?I've personally noticed two serious problems with CRZ. One is with the Sandstone Drake - you will fall off to your death if the driver flies over zone lines. The other is archaeology dig site resets. This is probably the tip of the iceberg, but even when Blizzard is well aware of the problem they won't fix it or can't fix it. CRZ is not working.

The Fall off issue has been fixed however... the rider now gets Disconnected on Zone change so it's still borked. My biggest problem with the CRZ is the rares that were already camped (Time-Lost/Vyragosa) are now camped by 5+ people from each realm in a CRZ and it makes it harder to locate some battlepets as they show when on a Flightpath as being tons there (Because you are on your own realm) then when you land you are automagically shifted to the CRZ version of the zone.

One terror group killed nearly 11,000 people in 2015 — and it wasn't ISIS.

While the Sunni militants in Syria and Iraq dominated the headlines in 2015, Boko Haram was killing more people than ever — potentially eclipsing the tally of its partner in terror.

Nigeria’s new government pledged to oust Boko Haram and has boasted of successfully retaking territory from the extremists, but experts warn this might merely have forced the group to change tactics and possibly prompted a higher civilian casualty toll.

How bad is it?

ISIS has continued its campaign of terror and was linked to attacks in Paris, Yemen, Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, Libya and elsewhere.

The bloodshed has dominated international attention — from headlines to halls of power — all while thousands have silently been slaughtered at the hands of Boko Haram.

Nigeria’s militant group — which has pledged allegiance to ISIS — has been tied to nearly 11,000 killings in 2015 as of mid-December, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

More than half of the deaths — around 6,500 — have been the direct result of Boko Haram's suicide bombings and armed raids. The rest died as a result of fighting between the militants and Nigerian troops, according to CFR's data.

With details and information from Boko Haram's heartland in northeast Nigeria hard to come by, most experts believe the true tally of the violence has been even higher and could still climb before the year’s end.

""Sadly they have a history of attacks around Christmas and New Year,"" said Dr. J. Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.

That could put Boko Haram on track to surpass last year's brutal toll and claim the mantle of deadliest terror group for a second year running. Recent findings from the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based think tank, showed that Boko Haram was the deadliest terror group in the world last year. ISIS came in second.

Between them, Boko Haram and ISIS accounted for more than half of the world's terrorism-related deaths in 2014, according to the Institute's Global Terrorism Index published in November.

How did we get here?

Boko Haram started off the year with a bang. After slipping from the headlines as attention faded on the mass kidnapping which sparked the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, Boko Haram mounted a massive attack in January on the fishing village of Baga.

Satellite images and eyewitness accounts told of a merciless assault in which Boko Haram fighters gunned down children and pregnant women who were not able to escape fast enough into the bush. Estimates of the death toll there ranged from over 100 to 2,000 killed.

That attack — and the prospect of an impending presidential election — sparked renewed government efforts to take on the militants and drive them from their strongholds.

Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS on March 7 — three weeks before the election — and once Muhammadu Buhari won the presidency, he pledged to defeat the militants by the end of the year.

What has the new Nigerian government done?

This ""very ambitious target"" showed a ""sense of renewed effort … energy and focus"" by the Nigerian state, according to Elizabeth Donnelly, assistant head and research fellow of the Africa program at the London-based Chatham House think tank.

Nigerian troops — aided by its neighbors Chad, Niger and Cameroon — picked up where the"

\frac{T_c}{100\hbox{MeV}} \right ) d_{nuc},$$ where the factor $T_c/100$MeV scales the value of $d_{nuc}$ from a given critical temperature to $T=100$MeV, where $l$ is defined.

In the bag model we can approximate $ d_{nuc} $ in homogeneous nucleation theory without curvature energy in terms of the bag constant, $B$, by $$\label{dsurf}
d_{nuc} \approx 13  \left ( \frac {145\hbox{MeV}}{B^{1/4}} \right )^2
\left ( \frac{4B}{L} \right )
\left ( \frac {\sigma }{0.035B^{3/4}} \right )^{3/2} \hbox{cm},$$ where $ L $ is the latent heat and $ \sigma $ the surface tension. Lattice QCD calculations [@surft] suggest that $ \sigma \lesssim 0.24T_c^3 $, Ref. [@latent] finds $ \sigma 
\simeq 0.025T_c^3 $ and $L\simeq 0.4B$. With $ T_c \simeq 0.68B^{1/4} $, this gives $ d_{nuc} \simeq 0.1 $m for $ T_c > 100 $MeV.

We calculate the surface tension self-consistently within the multiple reflection expansion framework of the MIT bag model and get $ \sigma \lesssim 0.035B^{3/4} $ and $L\simeq 4B$, corresponding to $ d_{nuc} \lesssim 0.1 $m. But we also self-consistently take into account the important curvature term and find a crude approximate formula for $ d_{nuc} $, $$\label{dcurv}
d_{nuc} \approx 1.8 \left ( \frac{145\hbox{MeV}}{B^{1/4}} \right )^2 
\left ( \frac{4B}{L} \right ) \hbox{cm}.$$ Note, that in this approximation the mean nucleation distance depends only on the bag constant (or $ T_c $). Thus the overall effect of including a curvature term is roughly a factor of 7 reduction of $ d_{nuc} $. With these estimates of $ d_{nuc} $ in mind it hardly seems possible to get any significant deviations from standard nucleosynthesis, if homogeneous nucleation theory applies.

However, homogeneous nucleation may not be the prime mechanism responsible for hadron formation. It is well-known from every day life that first order transitions are normally facilitated by impurities, such as dust or ions and container walls. Think e.g. of a charged particle entering a cloud chamber, or boiling water where (half) bubbles are formed at the bottom of the pot. Such nucleations are denoted heterogeneous. Thus it is obvious to consider the effect of such impurities on the quark-hadron phase transition. Candidates are the topological impurities, like primordial black holes, magnetic monopoles, and cosmic strings or relic fluctuations"

How to open a textfile in XNA/monogame(beginner here)?

Okay, so i am working in xna and i want to open this textfile which should open in a textfile. Here is the code:

                {
                    var fileToOpen = ""Name.txt"";
                    var process = new Process();
                    process.StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo()

                    process.WaitForExit();
                }

However an error occurs and cant find the textfile to open. I did this in a normal consol application and just added a new item textfile to the project and it worked fine in the console application, however in XNA it does not seem to work at all.
Also im really not well educated in file directory things and need a quick fix. The text files are placed in this area:

I hope this is of somehelp im trying to give as much information as possible. Just to note streamwriting to textfiles in the directory location shown in the image link works perfectly fine and i just give the name of the file as shown below:

However it just didt seem to work when i want to open the textfile in notepad and allow for typing to be done in the textfile in notepad. The reason why i want to open a text file for typing is the user entering there name and i dont have knowledge or the time to do XNA textbox input creation which seems complicated from the tutorials i have seen, which is why i want to open the textfile in notepad for editing.

A Christian cult leader and psychotherapist who breastfed her clients by telling them to suckle'mummy's milk' has been jailed for a series of bizarre sexual assaults on women.

Vanessa Clark, 63, manipulated her clients into paying thousands of pounds for'skin to skin' contact - including breastfeeding - which she claimed had been approved by a priest to heal depression.

The court heard Clark massaged one victim until she became aroused before telling her this was her 'inner baby' coming out.

Another vulnerable client, who began shaking as she spoke about her childhood, was asked by Clark: 'Does baby want some milk?'

Clark has now been jailed for four years after 'wholly abusing' her position of trust as a psychotherapist.

The court heard how the former cult leader - who had been recommended to her victims by fellow Christians - admitted carrying out the abuse to feed her'sadistic desires'.

In a confession letter written to her female partner, Clark said: 'I would breastfeed my clients and on one occasion took off my top and told her it was a special thing I would do only for her.

'It was entirely deceptive and manipulative. I subjected her to my sadistic desires.'

Prosecutor Henry James told Oxford Crown Court that the 'unusual and troubling' offences took place between 1996 and 2001 because Clark wanted to wield 'power' over her victims.

Clark had been recommended to her two victims by fellow Christians and invited them back to a flat in London to perform her 'therapy'.

One of the victims, who had been struggling to come to terms with abuse during her childhood, began having 'intense and personal sessions' with Clark, during which the abuse took place.

Mr James said: 'The victim was required to regress"

He was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in May 2010, and served in that position until September 2012.

Early life
Burstow was born in Carshalton in Surrey, son of a tailor, and was educated at Glastonbury High School for Boys, a former boys' secondary modern school in Carshalton, followed by Carshalton College and the South Bank Polytechnic, where he obtained a degree in business studies. He started his career as a buying assistant with Allied Shoe Repairs in 1985. The following year he worked briefly in print sales with KallKwik Printers, before becoming a research assistant at the London Borough of Hounslow in 1987.

Politics before parliament
He was elected as a councillor for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to the Sutton Borough Council in 1986, and was its deputy leader from 1994 to 1997. Burstow remained a councillor for the Rosehill ward in Sutton until 2002, after his election to Parliament.

978,22,11217,"2019 Rugby Championship

The 2019 Rugby Championship was the eighth edition of the annual southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, featuring Argentina, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The competition is operated by SANZAAR, a joint venture of the four countries' national unions.

The tournament schedule was similar to that of the 2015 edition, being shortened due to the World Cup.

New Zealand was the three-time back-to-back defending champions entering this years Championship. However, South Africa claimed their fourth title, their first since the inception of the Rugby Championship and their first Southern Hemisphere title since 2009.	
They became the third team to claim the expanded Southern Hemisphere championship, following New Zealand and Australia.

Background
The tournament is operated by SANZAAR and known for sponsorship reasons as The Castle Rugby Championship in South Africa, The Investec Rugby Championship in New Zealand, The Mitsubishi Estate Rugby Championship in Australia, and The Personal Rugby Championship in Argentina.

Format
Because of the 2019 World Cup, the tournament schedule was reduced, as it was in 2015, to each team playing each other once. Australia and Argentina each played two home matches out of the three matches to be played in total. New Zealand and South Africa had one home fixture. As usual, a win earned a team four league points, a draw two league points, and a loss by eight or more points zero league points. A bonus point was earned in one of two ways: by scoring at least three tries more than the opponent in a match, or by losing within seven points. The competition winner was the side with the most points at the end of the tournament.

Other Cups 
Because the Bledisloe Cup is decided in two home-and-away legs, after the end of the shortened Rugby Championship, New Zealand and Australia played for the Bledisloe Cup decider at Eden Park, Auckland, with Australia leading the series 1-0. New Zealand retained the Cup for the 17th consecutive year with a comprehensive 36-0 win, concluding in a 1-1 series result.

5 6 133 78 5 121 87 9
7 8 126 87 8 120 83 4 

So two IDs (let's say, father=IID.m and mother=IID.f) and three variables that belong to the first ID (score.m, measure.m, and health.m) and the same three after that belonging to the second ID (score.f, measure.f, and health.f). 
I need to make the following output files that consist of four columns:
File 1:
score.m health.f health.m score.f

File 2:
measure.m health.f health.m measure.f

File 3:
measure.m score.f score.m measure.f

In other words: two out of the three variables for the father and mother, in the order of ""variable 1 of the father"", ""variable 2 of the mother"", ""variable 2 of the father"", ""variable 1 of the mother"". These need to be separate tab-delimited output files for all combinations of variables. 
In this case this would mean only three different output files, because there are only three different combinations (score+health, measure+health, measure+score). In reality I have far more variables, so much more possible combinations, which is why I suspect I need a for-loop (or a for loop within a for loop?). How do I do this within R?

A:

Consider running combn to get all combinations of the score, measure, and health column indices. Then run that return list in lapply to build subsetted dataframes. However, you do not want all combinations but only where pairings match between f and m, so run a Filter on list of dataframe and specifically run another combn to build variable pairings for grep calls.

""What happens on track is the most important part. The success is the result of the work done a long time ago. Right now it's 25 years since the union between Dorna, FIM, MSMA [manufacturers' association] and IRTA [teams' association]. It's the celebration of a way of working.

""When we arrived all parties were fighting between them, it was a different world. IRTA was angry with the FIM and they didn't quite believe us. Then we tried to convince everybody about the method we needed to implement. It's easier to succeed if you get everybody to agree.""

In your push to make the championship more sustainable, which measures are you applying besides the ones already implemented, like standard electronics?

""A new commercial system has been established. From 2017, each manufacturer that makes its bikes available to other teams at a maximum price of €2.2m will receive a €2m bonus. And the satellite teams will get another two million so they can pretty much pay the entire cost of that leasing.""

Is the USA still MotoGP's unfinished business?

""Our handicap in that sense is that the championship takes place on a bad timezone for the USA. If we didn't have a race from 1995, and if it took 10 years until we returned to Laguna Seca, it was because there weren't any tracks that were homologated. We did very well there, and that led to landing in Indianapolis and Austin.

""What happens is that the manufacturers have a representative per country, and on the first year they focused all their efforts on Laguna Seca, which was an incredible event in terms of repercussion.

""But when we arrived in Indianapolis they divided the budget, and that made the event less sustainable. That's why we think it's best to have"

Canonical form for set of lists

I am given two unordered sets, each containing m lists of n items. Example for m=4 and n=3:
D1 = {[4,2,1], [3,3,1], [4,2,3], [1,2,1]}
D2 = {[3,2,3], [4,2,3], [1,1,3], [4,2,1]}

The two sets are considered equivalent if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in their respective lists. In the example above, D1 and D2 are equivalent because there is an assignment (1,2,3,4) in D1 ↔ (3,2,1,4) in D2.
In this example, the items are numbers, but this does not really matter, because I only care about the equivalence relation between two sets and not about the items themselves.
I am looking for a fast way to check if two given sets are equivalent. Rather than performing a backtracking search to find the assignments between items, can the sets be serialized in a unique (canonical) form, so that two sets can be shown to be equivalent if their canonical forms are identical?
Update: Even though this problem seems to be intractable in general (see answer below), it turns out that a search with backtracking works well in practice for my data. Below is the pseudocode for my implementation:
s = new stack(of level)
x1_x2 = new dictionary(of int, int)
bound_x2s = new set(of int)

function setsEquivalent(d1: set, d2: set) : boolean
    if d1.m <> d2.m or d1.n <> d2.n: return false        
    s.push(new level)
    do until s.size = 0
        m1 = s.size
        m2 = s.top.m2
        if m1 > m
            return true
        elseif s.top.m2 > m
            backtrack()
        else                
            s.push(new level)

Clive Bates, The Counterfactual

New data on youth vaping. Time to take a closer look at the disclosure of some 2018 U.S. National Youth Tobacco Survey data (see MMWR). The survey is conducted annually, with field work in February-June. Usually, the results are published in headline form about a year later (2017 data was published in June 2018) and full datasets some time after that. 2018 is different however. CDC and FDA (the co-authors) have rushed out data that they argue supports the claim there is an ‘epidemic’ of teenage vaping use (see FDA chief calls youth e-cigarette an ‘epidemic’, Washington Post).

But US continues to urge bans – Fergus Mason

990,20,2585,"

He went travelling around Texas early in 1932, and he was in a sullen, rainy border town on the Rio Grande when he first came up with the idea of a bleak, pitiless northern land named Cimmeria. The obvious inhabitant of such a place would be an equally bleak, pitiless barbarian – and his name was Conan.

Howard was a master of the pulp market by this time, and he set out to make Conan as commercially appealing as possible. He got home and settled on the idea of an over-arching Hyborean Age, a time of pseudo-history uniting themes – and places – from across his earlier work. The first Conan story was a reworking of a Kull piece that hadn’t sold. Howard ripped out the elements that had bogged it down, and revised what remained into a thrilling, vivid crowd-pleaser.

By the time Weird Tales printed “The Phoenix on the Sword”, in December of 1932, Howard had already written nine more Conan tales, along with “The Horror from the Mound”, the first Weird West story, which was published in Weird Tales the following year.

Conan was taking Weird Tales by storm, so after a bit of a break, Howard dashed off another set of simple Conan yarns in early 1933. He took on Otis Kline as an agent to help him expand into other markets, with the understanding that Weird Tales would remain his own personal relationship. Kline helped him sell a number of stories that had previously been rejected, and encouraged him to broaden his horizon. Over the course of the year, Howard wrote his first story about James Allison, a disabled Texan who recalled adventurous past lives, and he finally made good use of his El Borak Texan gunslinger character, transporting him to Afghanistan, where he grimly tried to keep the peace in the era of the First World War. Late in the year, he returned to Conan, and started to work earnestly on deeper, punchier stories than the ones he’d churned out some months before.

In 1934, now 28, he started work on “The Hour of the Dragon”, a Conan novel requested by a British publishing house who felt that there was no real market in the UK for short stories. Unfortunately, the company collapsed before they were able to get the book published, and Weird Tales took it to release in sections. Howard was becoming interested in westerns at this point though, particularly humorous yarns and tall tales.

Since Weird Tales was well behind on their payments, he decided to pursue this new fascination. Action Stories took the first of the Breckenridge Elkins stories, and loved it so much they had a new instalment of the series in every issue until significantly after Howard’s death. Other pulps started clamouring for similar work, and he created clones of Elkins for Argosy (Pike Bearfield) and Cowboy Stories (Buckner J. Grimes).

That same year, he started dating Novalyne Price, a former girlfriend of an old college friend of his who took a job in Cross Plains. Breckenridge Elkins quickly became the most successful series that Howard had ever written"

Top 1 in group by clause in SQL Server?

I'm creating a trading platform and I need from a table to bring the following data:
date, open price, close price, highest price, lowest price, volume, value of volume.

I created this query :
Select 
    min(Price) as Low,
    max(price) as High,
    sum(Quantity) as Volume,
    sum(Price) as Value,
    dateadd(DAY, 0, datediff(day, 0, CreatedOn)) as Date,
    CompanyIdentifier 
from 
    Transactions 
group by 
    dateadd(DAY, 0, datediff(day, 0, CreatedOn)), CompanyIdentifier

What is this query is doing is for a certain company (identified by CompanyIdentifier) on a certain day (Date) brings the lowest price,highest price,volume and value of volume.What I cannot add in this query is the open price and the close price for that company in that day.Basically the top 1 price with the data ordered ascending by date.What I tried and it seems to do the trick is the following query:
SELECT * 
FROM (select Quantity, PRICE, CompanyIdentifier, 
             dateadd(DAY,0, datediff(day,0, CreatedOn)) AS U, 
             ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by CompanyIdentifier, dateadd(DAY,0, datediff(day,0, CreatedOn)) order by CREATEDON) AS 'COUN' 
      from Transactions
     ) AS AL 
where COUN = 1

But these are 2 separate queries and I want only one query.I also tried to add:
FIRST_VALUE(Price) over (order by price) as first

in the first query but I received the error that the function in not in a group by clause,I added the function the the group by query and I receive the following error :

Windowed functions can only appear in the SELECT or ORDER BY clauses.

So,how could I add those two columns in the first query?

A:

One method is to use window functions and select distinct:
select distinct t.CompanyIdentifier, v.createdDate,
       min(Price) over (partition by t.CompanyIdentifier, v.createdDate) as Low,
       max(price) over (partition by t.CompanyIdentifier, v.createdDate) as High,
       sum(Quantity) over (partition by t.CompanyIdentifier, v.createdDate) as Volume,
       sum(Price) over (partition by t.CompanyIdentifier, v.createdDate) as Value,
       first_value(Price) over (partition by t.CompanyIdentifier, v.createdDate order by CreatedOn asc) as first_price,   
       first_value(Price) over (partition by t.CompanyIdentifier, v.createdDate order by CreatedOn desc) as last_price   
from Transactions t cross apply
     (values (convert(date, CreatedOn))) v(createdDate)

This is needed because SQL Server offers first_value() as a window function, but nothing similar as an aggregation function.
A more traditional approach uses conditional aggration:
Select t.CompanyIdentifier, t.createdDate,
       min(Price) as Low, max(price) as High,

993,4,13475,"A vanilloid receptor, a receptor for capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), has been cloned in 1997 and called vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (hereinafter referred to as “TRPV1”) by Caterina et al. (Caterina et al., Nature, 389, 816 (1997)). Located on small unmyelinated nerve fibers (C-fibers) and also on large myelinated nerve fibers (A-fibers), TRPV1 is an ion channel which plays an important role in sensitizing pain stimuli by introducing a strong influx of cations such as calcium and sodium ions into the nerve endings upon activation in response to external or internal stimuli. External stimuli capable of activating TRPV1 are reported to include heat and acids as well as vanilloid compounds (Tominaga et al., Neuron, 21, 531 (1998)). The internal stimuli to TRPV1, on the other hand, are leukotriene metabolites such as 12-hydroperoxyeicosa tetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) (Hwang at al., PNAS, 97, 3655 (2000)), and arachidonic acid derivatives such as anandamide (Premkumar et al., Nature, 408, 985 (2000)).
On the basis of these physiological activities, TRPV1 has attracted intensive attention as an integral controller playing a pivotal role in transferring various external stimuli into nerve cells. According to a report, TRPV1 knock-out mice respond like normal mice to general stimuli, but showed greatly reduced pain response to heat or thermal hyperalgesia (Caterina et al., Science, 288, 306 (2000)).
TRPV1 is expressed mainly in primary sensory neurons (Caterina et al., Nature, 389, 816 (1997)), which are responsible for controlling the functions of the skin, bone, and internal organs such as the bladder, the gastrointestinal tract, the lungs, and so on. In addition, TRPV1 is also distributed in other neurons on the central nervous system, the kidney, the stomach, and T-cells (Nozawa et al., Neuroscience Letter, 2001, 309, 33; Yiangou et al., Lancet ("

995,27,587,"1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric device which takes advantage of reversible non-180-degree domain rotation. The present invention also relates to a process for producing the above piezoelectric device, and a liquid discharge device using the above piezoelectric device.
2. Description of the Related Art
Currently, the piezoelectric devices constituted by a piezoelectric body and electrodes are used as, for example, piezoelectric actuators installed in inkjet recording heads. In such piezoelectric devices, the piezoelectric body expands and contracts in response to increase and decrease in the strength of an electric field applied from the electrodes to the piezoelectric body. For example, perovskite oxides such as PZT (lead titanate zirconate) are known as materials suitable for the piezoelectric body. The piezoelectric materials are ferroelectric materials, which exhibit spontaneous polarization even when no electric field is applied.
In the conventional piezoelectric devices, the field-induced strain (i.e., the piezoelectric stain along the spontaneous-polarization axis of the ferroelectric body) is commonly utilized by applying an electric field along the direction of the spontaneous-polarization axis, i.e., the direction of the applied electric field is commonly identical to the direction of the spontaneous-polarization axis. However, since the magnitude of displacement is limited in the case where only the field-induced strain of the ferroelectric body is utilized, demands for greater displacement is increasing.
In the above circumstances, piezoelectric devices taking advantage of the non-180-degree domain rotation (such as the 90-degree domain rotation) have been proposed. In the case where the 180-degree domain rotation is utilized, the orientation of the spontaneous-polarization axis merely turns upside down. Therefore"

The marathon course begins at Congress and San Jacinto, treks west through Memorial Park, south to Post Oak, east through Rice Village and North on Kirby before finishing on Allen Parkway.

Those who live within that roughly 15-square-mile area, as well as spectators who want to see the race, would be wise to consult the marathon's extensive list of road closures. Streets surrounding the start and finishing areas will be blocked off as early as Thursday through Sunday afternoon, while roads used for the course will be closed on a rolling basis from 6:15 a.m. to 2:20 p.m. Sunday.

Parts of downtown and Midtown will also be closed on Saturday morning for the 5k race.

The marathon has put together a handy list of ten popular viewing locations. Popular perches include Washington Avenue, West Gray, Tanglewood and Memorial Park.

Also worth noting is that runners may ride METRO for free on Sunday with their bibs (just not, of course, during the race).

As for the weather, forecasters predict temperatures will cool down this weekend from near-record highs this week, but still remain about 20 degrees above normal for January. KHOU is calling for highs in the mid-70s Saturday and Sunday, with a chance for a few stray showers during the marathon. The marathon will begin Sunday at 7 a.m. (when, of course, it will still be hot and humid.)

Runners consider temps in the 50s with low humidity as ideal long-distance running weather — so Sunday's unseasonable warmth will likely result in slower times across the board.

The weather takes a turn for the worse on Monday, when heavy rains could bring flooding to the region. We'll keep an eye on that storm system as it approaches and update readers about the flood risk.
