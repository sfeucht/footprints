In his letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Grassley first notes that the two FBI officials shared a worry about how they would be perceived by a future President Hillary Clinton if they conducted her interview “loaded for bear.”

Grassley also inquired about the FBI’s handling of appearances of conflicts of interest at the Justice Department and the FBI during the Clinton investigation and highlighted several texts that discuss potential for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

I'm trying to implement MVC in JavaScript. I have googled and reorganized with my code countless times but have not found a suitable solution. (The code just doesn't ""feel right"".)
Here's how I'm going about it right now. It's incredibly complicated and is a pain to work with (but still better than the pile of code I had before). It has ugly workarounds that sort of defeat the purpose of MVC.

// Create a ""main model""
var main = Model0();

function Model0() {
    // Create an associated view and store its methods in ""view""
    var view = View0();

    // Create a submodel and pass it a function 
    // that will ""subviewify"" the submodel's view
    var model1 = Model1(function (subview) {
        view.subviewify(subview);

This invention relates to peak respiratory flow monitoring. More specifically, this invention relates to peak flow monitoring of individuals with obstructive respiratory diseases and other conditions and includes apparatus for, and methods of, using this technique in the home and office as well as enhancing patient and physician access to calculated medical data computed therein.
2. Statement of the Art
Peak respiratory flow monitoring of patients with obstructive respiratory diseases or conditions, such as asthma, has been available for many years. Inexpensive mechanical peak flow meters have been used for patient home and office use and many patients have been taught to record their daily peak flow values and their symptoms in a personal diary. The physician then reviews the entries in a patient""""s diary during regular office visits.
Monitoring of peak respiratory flow helps a patient to manage his or her condition. Generally, peak flow values below 80% of the patient""""s personal best are an indication that the patient needs more medication or a change in medication to control his or her condition. Peak flow values below 50% of a patient""""s personal best indicate that the patient should seek medical help immediately.
In measuring and monitoring peak flow, certain pressure data are calculated and evaluated in the form of pulmonary function parameter values. For example, Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) is the fastest rate at which a person can exhale air out of the lungs after inhaling as large a volume of air as possible. Forced Expiratory Volume (FEVt) is the largest volume of air a person can exhale from the lungs over a time interval, xe2x80x9ct.xe2x80x9d FEV1 is the largest volume of air that a person can exhale from the lungs in one second.

===============

The outbreak of COVID-19 has lasted for several months and spread to the world, WHO had called it pandemic. Because COVID-19 is extremely infectious, and people still have little knowledge about the disease in the early stage of the epidemic, no effective measures have been taken to stop the spread of the virus, so a large number of people have been infected in a short period of time. Compared with a large number of patients, the number of medical staff is obviously insufficient, so they have to increase the number of shifts to deal with this situation. The overloaded work intensity has a strong impact on the physical and psychological health of medical staff. In addition, frequent shift work disrupts the continuity of treatment. It is reported that there are varying degrees of psychological and sleep disorders in the frontline medical staff\[[@bib1],[@bib2]\], but there are few reports on the impact of the night shift schedule of medical staff on medical treatment during the epidemic. This study compares the treatment of patients admitted before and after the night shift schedule changed, and explores the relationship between the improved night shift schedule and the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

2. Methods {#sec2}
==========

2.1. Study design and participants {#sec2.1}
----------------------------------

This single-center, retrospective, observational study was done at Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China). We retrospectively analysed patients from Jan 24, 2020, to Mar 26, 2020, who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, according to WHO interim guidance\[[@bib3]\]. We arrived in Wuhan on February 2, 2020 and started our support work. The initial night shift schedule was based on a four-day cycle, namely, working from 8 am to 4 pm on the first day, from 4 pm to 12 pm on the second day, from 12 pm to 8 am on the third day, and then taking another day off. All doctors were on duty in accordance with the above rules before the night shift schedule changed. We started implementing the new night shift schedule on Feb 10, 2020, for doctors who are skilled in emergency technique (endotracheal intubation, etc.) or doctors with extensive first aid experience, they only need to work during the day (from 9 am to 6 pm) instead of night shift. Meanwhile, the new night shift schedule of other doctors took a six-day cycle, working from 8 am to 2 pm on the first day, from 2 pm to 8 pm on the second day, from 8 pm to 12 pm on the third day, from 12 pm to 8 am on the fourth day, and then had two days off. The night shift schedule of nurses took a six-day cycle, working from 8 am to 2 pm on the first day, from 2 pm to 8 pm on the second day, from 8 pm to 12 pm on the third day, and from 12 pm to 8 am on the fourth day, and then had two days off. The nurse\'s night shift schedule had never been changed. So, we divided all patients into two groups: initial period group (admission before Feb 10, 2020) and recent period group (admission after Feb 10, 2020). Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by the local health authority.

The Ethics Commission of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University approved this study (IRB:202051). Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.

2.2. Data collection {#sec2.2}
--------------------

We reviewed clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The admission data of these patients were collected.

2.3. Outcomes {#sec2.3}
-------------

The primary outcome was the mortality from hospital admission to the cut off date. Since the Medical team of Guangzhou Medical University to assist Wuhan completed the mission and returned to Guangzhou on April 8, the cut-off date was Apr 7, 2020. Sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock\[[@bib4]\]. Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteremia and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens (qualified sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or blood samples after admission\[[@bib4]\]. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines"
9,5,3696," to send a man to jail on these grounds. Without some sort of condemnation of the crime there could be no agreement on what action is to be taken. Aside from these social problems, there may be a more convincing reason not to support moral abolitionism when its implications are considered on a more personal level. It may be the case that we actually need a moral discourse in order to function properly as humans, as a way of combating our fallacies and shortcomings. Richard Joyce argues that moral discourse could be used as an expedient to help us triumph over our many ‘practical irrationalities’ such as weakness of will and passion, which interfere in our decision making processes even when we can clearly see which action should be taken. One major failing that Hobbes identifies in human rationality is the ‘perverse desire for present profit’7which can stand in the way of doing what we know is the right thing and ultimately the most profitable in favour of immediate benefit. Joyce holds that moral thinking can act as a safeguard against this ‘perverse desire’ and ‘bolster our self control.’ In essence, ‘moral beliefs can help us to act in an instrumentally rational manner’ It seems clear from these deliberations that we can not gain anything through moral abolitionism, and not only do we not gain, but by completely abandoning moral discourse we stand to lose a large portion of our human faculty for rationality, as well as promoting a society of defection and distress. If there is anything to be gained by observing that moral truths are “queer” it will be under the following conditions; the observation will necessarily lead us to the conclusion that we should abandon our belief in moral truths. However, this loss of belief will not cause us to abolish moral discourse entirely as we have established that the losses would be too great. Therefore, to determine whether or not there is anything to gain we must assess a system that allows us to utilise and our long established moral discourse despite the fact that we no longer believe it under the most critical conditions. One suggestion to get around this problem could be to perpetuate the myth that moral truths exist by continually distributing materials that reinforce this opinion, and failing to disclose any argument to the contrary. In essence, a sort of moral propagandism. However, I do not wish to entertain this as a serious option as I do not believe morality to be the sort of thing one can bolster by a purposeful mass deception. This would be a very fragile and foolhardy solution. There is one alternative that we should consider in more detail, and that is the sort of moral fictionalism put forward by Richard Joyce. In order to adequately assess Joyce’s proposition, it is necessary to first isolate and examine what it means to fictionalise a concept to determine what exactly is meant by the term fictionalism. Once discussed, the term will then need to be applied to the discourse of morality and the implications of this pairing will need to be analysed. Joyce stipulates that ‘...to take a fictionalist stance towards a discourse is to believe that the discourse entails or embodies a theory that is false, but to carry on employing the discourse, at least in many contexts, as if this were not the case, because it is useful to do so.’ On first impression this seems to fit our need very well, but we must ask the question; what does it mean to fictionalise a discourse? Central to the concept is the idea of make-believe, as essentially we are pretending to believe something that, under the closest scrutiny, we actually don’t. As such, if moral fictionalism were to be adopted it would cease to be assertoric. It portends to something like noncognitivism or expressivism but with two important differences. Firstly, Joyce clearly states that ‘the proposal is not that"

13,25,1711,"Volvo to lay off 500 workers at Virginia truck plant

By
Ed Hightower
17 December 2016

On Tuesday, Volvo Trucks announced its intention to lay off 500 workers, comprising the entire second shift, at its Dublin, Virginia plant. The layoffs will take place in early February. The announcement comes on top of 300 layoffs in September and another 500 in February.

Volvo cites decreased demand for its trucks as the reason for the latest round of layoffs at the plant, a claim that is belied by the fact that they are requiring the very workers they will terminate in February to come in to work overtime shifts this Saturday.

One Volvo worker, a member of United Autoworkers Union (UAW) Local 2069, told the World Socialist Web Site that workers might call in sick for the Saturday shift, a tactic called a “sick out.”

Asked what the UAW was doing to prevent the job losses, the worker became angry and said quickly, “It sets up perfectly for the union. They are holding their local elections in March, right after the layoffs take effect. If you are laid off the union doesn’t tell you when you can vote. So they exclude the workers who are most affected by their sellouts policies from being able to vote them out.”

The worker had been on the second shift at Volvo for several years, and had witnessed the results of previous UAW-brokered contracts. He added, “The union said the [March 2016] contract had 80 percent approval or something like that, but nobody voted for it. It was ratified in April 2016, but we didn’t even get the full contract in September, as people were being laid off.

“The union was so unserious about the contract that, back in March right before the old contract expired, they told me to watch the news to see if we would be on strike or not! I was at work the day it was set to expire and only heard a half hour beforehand that there was an agreement and we were to keep working when the shift ended.”

He added, “The UAW trailer sits on site, with 5-15 people sitting in there smoking cigarettes, doing nothing, but getting full pay. It is locked with a punch code. When I went in there to ask about a contract, they all jumped out of their seats and pulled out their printed contracts, pretending to do something.”

The worker described a recent exchange with a UAW shop steward about the pending layoffs:

“I asked him, ‘Can you name one person who got money from the union after the [September 2016] layoffs?’ He replied, ‘How would we do that? We give to organizations that do good things in the community.’

“I said, ‘Why not have a soup kitchen for laid off workers? Have you helped anyone? How much of my dues went to Hillary? None of my dues goes to my fellow workers who are laid off. Will any come to me?’”

At that point the shop steward walked away.

UAW Local 2069 has nothing on its Facebook page about either the upcoming layoffs or those in September. The most recent post promotes the thinly coded antidemocratic nostrum of “fake news” impacting the 2016 US presidential election.

Asked what exactly Local 2069 does, the worker replied, “They do something about veterans riding motorcycles to Washington and they have a fish fry at the Veterans Affairs hospital. They supported Clinton. The reps went to Florida after the [March 2016] contract was signed for a rally for Clinton.”

Finally, the worker described the pool of unemployed workers that Volvo maintains:

“All of the local ‘get a job’ programs are bogus. They don’t want you to get another job. They move paper around. In the New River Valley, it is hard to get another job because employers think you may be hired back at Volvo. You get put in a Volvo stack because you are addicted to this place and you will go back. They know you don’t want to lose your hire date and status. This place is a noose around everybody’s neck to keep them in there building trucks.”

Volvo workers should immediately take steps to defend their jobs by building rank-and-file factory committees tasked with unifying workers of all tiers within the plant against job cuts. Ties to auto and other workers across the continent and internationally must be built to coordinate action against giant transnational corporations like Volvo, Freightliner and their parent companies.

Most importantly, such a struggle to unite the working class must be set on socialist and internationalist foundations in opposition to the pro-corporate, nationalist orientation of the U"

18,14,16931,"for example, by using a GroupByKey
transform) a common pattern is to combine the collection of values associated with each key into
a single, merged value.

Drawing on the previous example from GroupByKey, a key-grouped
PCollection called groupedWords looks like this:

cat, [1,5,9]
dog, [5,2]
and, [1,2,6]
jump, [3]
tree, [2]
...

In the above PCollection, each element has a string key (for example,
""cat"") and an iterable of integers for its value (in the first element, containing [1,
5, 9]), where each integer represents the line number in the original text where the key
appeared. If our pipeline's next processing step combines the values (rather
than considering them individually), you can combine the iterable of integers
to create a single, merged value to be paired with each key.

The actual logic of how to combine the values is up to you; for example, given a key-grouped
collection of keys and integer values, you might choose to sum the collection of
integers associated with each key (which is useful when the values represent occurrence counts,
for example). In our example, because the values represent line numbers, we might want to take
the min, indicating the first occurrence.

Using Combine PerKey

The Dataflow SDKs represent this entire pattern—GroupByKey, then
merging the collection of values—as the Combine PerKey transform.

Combine PerKey performs both steps of the pattern: You apply it to a
PCollection of key/value pairs, just as
you would a GroupByKey. The
Combine PerKey transform then applies a combine function you supply to the set of all values
associated with each key. The combine operation produces a new PCollection of
key/value pairs, which contains unique keys and a single, merged value for each key.

Combine PerKey performs the GroupByKey transform as part
of its operation; therefore, it behaves as GroupByKey
does when your PCollection is divided using
windowing. That is, Combine PerKey combines
per key and window.

While you can create a ParDo to perform this kind of function
(namely, by key-grouping a collection and then combining the values), the more structured
semantics of the CombineFn transform allows the Cloud Dataflow service to
execute the combining operation more efficiently.

This is an interesting finding since it has been reported that in acutely and chronically *T. cruzi*-infected patients and during the murine infection, cardiac CD4^+^/CD8^+^ T cell ratio shows a predominance of CD8^+^ T cells suggestive of an immunologic imbalance response ([@b17-dti-2-2007-061]; [@b23-dti-2-2007-061]; [@b13-dti-2-2007-061]; [@b16-dti-2-2007-061]; [@b11-dti-2-2007-061]).

The parasitism control and decreased CD8^+^ T cells levels in the myocardium of DB569-treated group was concomitantly found with an unaltered ECG profile that might be ultimately contributing to their increased survival rates. This therapeutic effect of DB569 on the bradyarrhythmia could be related to trypanocidal effect of the diamidine and/or the modulation of the host immunological response to the parasite. In fact, the regulation of immune response in *T. cruzi*-infected mice by other trypanocidal drugs, such as benznidazole, has already been reported ([@b27-dti-2-2007-061]; [@b31-dti-2-2007-061]), and our previous *in vitro* data showed that parasite elimination was more effective after treatment of infected phagocytic cells as compared to cardiac ones ([@b6-dti-2-2007-061]). Additionally, as DB569 induces apoptosis in *T. cruzi* ([@b8-dti-2-2007-061]), the presence of apoptotic parasites in cardiac tissues could contribute for regulation of the host inflammatory orchestra ([@b12-dti-2-2007-061]; [@b9-dti-2-2007-061]).

Although the mechanisms leading to chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) are still unknown, the initial cardiac damage caused by the parasite seems to play a critical role for the progression of the disease ([@b34-dti-2-2007-061]). Moreover, specific trypanocidal treatment seems to be associated with delay in human heart disease progression ([@b36-dti-2-2007-061]). In addition, although accumulated data highlighted the concept that tissue damage is direct or indirectly induced by *T. cruzi* itself and thus the control of parasite load by a host effective inflammatory response could represent a prerequisite to arrest the evolution of the disease, an excessive or imbalanced inflammation (as an auto reactivity response) can also contribute to the genesis of the cardiac damage (reviewed in [@b10-dti-2-2007-061]). In fact, chronic chagasic patients submitted to benznidazole therapy although not parasitologically cured, presented a marked reduction in the occurrence of ECG changes and a lower frequency of deterioration in their clinical conditions ([@b35"

Kirill Gerstein () (born 23 October 1979) is a Russian-American pianist. He is the sixth recipient of the Gilmore Artist Award. An American citizen since 2003, Gerstein divides his time between the United States and Germany and is currently a professor of piano at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart.

Early life and education 
Gerstein was born in Voronezh in the former Soviet Union to a Russian Jewish family and began playing the piano at age three. At the age of 11, he won his first competition—the International Bach Competition in Gorzów, Poland. Though he studied classical piano formally, he also learned to play jazz by listening to his parents' record collection. At the age of 14, he met jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton at a festival in St. Petersburg, which led to a full-scholarship offer to study jazz piano at Boston's Berklee College of Music. Gerstein was the youngest student ever admitted to the school.

It's pretty interesting to see Gamestop do this deal. In the industry, the
consensus seems to be that in 5-8 years Gamestop is going to get killed as we
move towards digital distribution platforms.

So the question is, what do you do in the meantime? I don't think keeping
brick and mortar stores around but changing the revenue mix will make a big
difference. There isn't anything left to really change to. Hollywood Video had
some success with Game Crazy (a Gamestop competitor). But now the gaming biz
is set to go away too.

I see it as two options:

A. Go out and do deals (Gamestop is debt free and has hundreds of millions in
cash) -- Gamestop appears to be doing this with the Kongregate deal

B. Start releasing cash back via dividends and buybacks. Game Group in the UK
(similar to Gamestop) pays out a big 7% dividend.

I'm interested in seeing which one ultimately works out. Gamestop could make
(A) work, but only if they do more deals, make the right hires, and give them
the kind of autonomy and support that is needed to build out an entirely new
business from within a dying one.

The obvious is to make the transition from retailer to publisher/distributor.
Valve was once a pure developer, but they made their transition to digital
distribution and publishing and I'm _pretty_ sure they're doing much better
now than when they were doing 1 game every other year distributed by Sierra or
some other publisher.

It's definitely out of Gamespot's comfort zone, surely, and Kongregate might
look like an odd purchase from a fanboy/consumer point of view. But, casual
gaming is incredibly lucrative, especially when linked to social networking
sites and mobile. I'm sure Gamestop won't stop (ha-ha) at Kongregate. Perhaps
they should next go after a big name in mobile, like Gameloft, ngmoco:) or
Glu.

I'd actually like to see some consolidation in the casual gaming industry, if
for no other reason than to see if casual gaming can be a place for heavy
hitting AAA-type publishers the size of EA or Activision, or if it's just the
land of the indies and one- or two-hit wonders.

Critical Commentaries...

Hello,
I think, that virtually all of the users of BW software would like to have in the BW every possible modern critical commentary (OTL, ICC, WBC, AB, FOTL, HK are the most know ones).
Even more: if it would be possible to browse the Bible text along with the chosen commentary/ies aside of it (like the engine of the parallel versions?), that would be great!!! I'm quite sure that such a volume of additions/changes deserves to be done within the next program version, yet every possible progress has began from imagination...
I'd appreciate other ideas in the area...
Sincerely,
Yuri.

Four Quotes

Justifying the rite can easily obscure the mentality of some of those who use the rite to create a homogenized ghetto of non-ethnics, in resistance to the supposed monolithicworld of ethnics out there. In reality, often enough, its just a ghetto of middle-class American values, and the other issues are symbolic.

This is not a reprint but an abbreviated excerpt of four quotations (addressed to WR Orthodox) from an article here (1/8/2007):
[we tried to link to it, but his links don’t work]

1. The reality is that most Western Orthodox Christians (that is, Orthodox Christians living in the West and possessing a Western culture) are Byzantine Rite and see no contradiction between their rite and their culture. Most of them have never heard of you.

2. When you use sarcastic phrases like the oh-so-mystical East, you give yourself away as being as much of an East-hater as you believe your brothers in the Byzantine parts of the Orthodox Church are West-haters. Many of you used to be Episcopalians besieged by utter heretics. It’s okay, though—you’re now among the Orthodox. You’re no longer besieged. You can take the battlements down and lower your weapons. Yes, there are folks in the Orthodox Church who do not understand you or even suspect the validity of your Orthodoxy. You won’t help them to accept you fully by sarcasm or a fortress mentality, however.

3. You were received into this Church and not into the pre-Schism Western Church. That means that you can’t pretend that people like St. Gregory Palamas aren’t relevant to you. For one thing, there is no East-West dividing line for what is needful in the Church, and for another, those to whom you rightly look for inspiration in the ancient West absolutely had zero problem with adopting the “Eastern” language and theology of their time (where, quite frankly, most of the serious doctrinal work was being done, due to heresy). They even adopted liturgical customs! It’s not a question of what’s appropriate to “the East” or “the West,” but what is Orthodox. Anything else is really a form of phyletism.

4. You do not have more in common with either the Roman Catholic or Anglican communions than you do with the Byzantine Rite Orthodox. Thinking or speaking as though you do is really just a schism waiting to happen.

""Not to enable the poor to share in our goods is to steal from them and deprive them of life. The goods we possess are not ours but theirs."" -- St. John Chrysostom

From OrthodoxWest

""I admit I have not scrutinized this blog, however based upon a quick peruse of the site I find it to be at most times a healthy criticism of the milieu of Orthodox Western Rite.... The author calls for balance in the face of American WR enthusiasms."" - Fr Stavrophoremonk Symeon, OrthodoxWest moderator

The York Forum

""I just discovered the existence of this new Orthodox blog on the Western Rite. To me, it appears to be a serious, fair-minded, and substantive blog, though perhaps more critical of the concept of Western Rite than I should like.... critics of the Western rite abound. Few care enough, though, to really think out what it is they mean, beyond having a knee-jerk reaction."" - Hieromonk Aidan

Fr. Augustine

“I was directed to this site, recently, and I have to say I thank God for it.
I am a believer that the Western Rite is viable and possible; I also believe that we are going about it rather poorly! I have long wanted people within the Western Rite to question themselves, their presuppositions, and to look critically at what"

As has been noted in the comments section, it’s been a while since a post (I was waiting for something positive to happen), but after a long weekend in Milwaukee and a day at the Clinic, it is on.

Last night’s game kept me stressed after my bedtime as Wickman (as he always seems to) made it interesting until the very last strike. Wick striking out LeCroy to win the game was like Tiki Barber running over Ronde Barber at the goal line to win the game. Despite the win, the offense still baffles in its inability to get a clutch hit.

Westbrook looked tentative and worked slower than his normal frenetic pace at first, but hit his groove in the 6th and cruised. I hope that it’s a sign of things to come. With C.C. fully operational, the rest of the rotation needs to take his lead and go after it. We’ll see how Millwood looks tonight against the Twins.

Watching the Twins lineup last night got me worried. I think that they’re deeper and have better hitters than the Tribe. Maybe it’s the Tribe’s slow start, or the amazing fact that Mauer is 21 and Morneau is 24, but I’m officially getting worried. Combine that deep lineup with Santana, Radke, J.C.

In 1999, the show The Fifth Estate managed to interview one of the men Benny Hinn hired to screen the people he cured on stage. He explained the process they used to keep the truly sick from ever making it onto the stage:

“They have staff members that go through, give them a quick interview, and they’ll ask them: ‘What’s wrong with you?’ ‘Oh, I’ve had rheumatoid arthritis of my left shoulder. I can’t lift it… ‘Can you lift your shoulder? Because if you can’t lift your shoulder, you can’t go on stage.'”

The only people allowed on stage with Hinn were those with psychosomatic problems or physical pains that could be temporarily dampened through the euphoria of believing that they were having a religious experience before a cheering crowd.

To test the information that the guard at given the Fifth Estate, the crew snuck a hidden camera on a young girl with cerebral palsy and tried to get her on stage.

As told, security guards swarmed the sick little girl and physically restrained her from approaching the man who claimed he could make the lame walk.

Heavenly Pleasures

Officially, Benny Hinn leads a non-profit religious charity. Every penny of the $100 million he brings in each year, he claims, is put toward the church and his healing services.

Hinn, though, owns two multi-million dollar mansions, a small fleet of Mercedes Benz vehicles, and a private personal chef.

The Fifth Estate also uncovered Hinn’s hotel bills from a layover in London. In a single night, he’d racked up over $4,000 in hotel bills, and he’d left the concierge and the bellmen a $2,000 tip.

Hinn has a private jet, as well, which is paid for by his followers. In 2006, he sent them a letter saying: “I am asking the Lord Jesus to speak to 6,000 of my precious partners to sow a seed of $1,000 in the next ninety days.”

32,2,11255,"croft and, in Godfather fashion, tried to get him to sign off on aspects of the NSA spying program. Cheney later blocked the promotion of a Justice Department official who had expressed reservations about the NSA spying.

It was Cheney who exempted his office from the requirement to protect classified information, and who then tried to abolish the executive branch office that was complaining about his self-exemption.

It was also Cheney who was the prime mover behind Bush’s signing statement spree. “The office of Vice President Dick Cheney routinely reviews pieces of legislation before they reach the President’s desk, searching for provisions that Cheney believes would infringe on Presidential power, according to former White House and Justice Department officials,” wrote Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe last May in a story that won a Pulitzer Prize. “The officials said Cheney’s legal adviser and chief of staff, David Addington, is the Bush Administration’s leading architect of the ‘signing statements’ the President has appended to more than 750 laws.” Two examples: Bush issued a signing statement on the anti-torture law to say that he would enforce it only to the extent that it didn’t interfere with his authority as commander in chief. And he issued a signing statement on an obscure postal bill last fall to give the Executive Branch an expansive right to open first-class mail.

Dick Cheney is a man who has gone way over the line, time and time again.

He is fond of saying he has a constituency of one—Bush—when in fact we are all his constituents. And as his constituents, we must avail ourselves of the only constitutional remedy at our disposal: impeachment. Article 2, Section 4, specifically allows for the impeachment of the Vice President. He clearly has committed “high crimes and misdemeanors,” which our founders construed to mean usurpations of power that subvert our system of checks and balances.

Cheney is a recidivist usurper. We cannot keep letting him get away with his crimes. Nor should we let Bush. But OK, start with Cheney first.

Fortunately, Representative Dennis Kucinich has gotten the ball rolling. This spring, he introduced House Resolution 333, which calls for the impeachment of Cheney. Kucinich’s bill is co-sponsored by Representatives William Lacy Clay, Yvette Clarke, Keith Ellison, Barbara Lee, Jim McDermott, Jan Schakowsky, Maxine Waters, Lynn Woolsey, and Albert Wynn.

It is too narrow for my liking. It contains only three articles. The first two say that Cheney “purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive citizens and Congress” in the lead-up to the Iraq War, both about weapons of mass destruction and about the alleged link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. The third one says Cheney “has openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States.” Kucinich notes that such a threat is a violation of the U.N. Charter.

Cheney should be brought up on more charges than these. But the concluding passage of the Kucinich bill is right on the mark:

“Vice President Richard B. Cheney has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as Vice President, and subversive of constitutional government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and the manifest injury of the United States. Wherefore, Richard B. Cheney, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.”

Many people of goodwill raise objections to the idea of impeachment for either Cheney or Bush. Let me attend to those.

But first, can we dispatch with the paternalistic claptrap that the American people somehow wouldn’t be able to endure another impeachment process? We are not so weak that we cannot stand up and fight for our constitutional system. Some of the people who make this argument are the very ones who foisted upon the nation the ludicrous impeachment of Bill Clinton. His petty, personal indiscretion, and even his serious lying under oath, pale in comparison to the crimes against the Republic that Bush and Cheney have been committing.

Still, some progressive allies say that impeachment will never pass. It’s a waste of time, so why try?

Well, we don’t know that.

Now that the Democrats have investigative powers, every time they turn over a new rock, more reptilian facts emerge.

And we may be headed toward a constitutional confrontation, as Bush and Cheney resist subpoenas from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.

Fulfilment of these requirements is in fact the main challenge of using nanoparticles in biomedicine.

Here, we aim to mimic the natural recipe of dynamic chemistry to develop the new concept of underwater Leidenfrost dynamic chemistry. Within the frame of this new concept, employing the reactants in a confined space under hydrodynamic flow conditions, we are able to synthesize monodisperse ZnO~2~ nanoparticles in an eco-friendly manner. The size of these nanoparticles can be optimally tailored and utilized for selective killing of cancerous cells.

Underwater Leidenfrost phenomenon
---------------------------------

The Leidenfrost effect justifying the behaviour of a water droplet levitating on the top of a superheated surface at a temperature much higher than the boiling point of water is an established phenomenon. The Leidenfrost chemistry was introduced in 2007 (ref. [@b12]). Since then, our research activities have notably contributed in resolving of the Leidenfrost phenomenon in terms of specification of the involved mechanism based on electrostatic and thermocapillary processes[@b13].

The Leidenfrost phenomenon encompasses several forms and is recognized by a minimum in the boiling curve, called as the Leidenfrost point[@b14]. With respect to each form, the phenomenon can be called differently. For instance, the Leidenfrost state of water droplet is known as the film boiling state in a pool boiling process. Thus, this reaction is not necessarily performed in a droplet and as patented by us the Leidenfrost chemistry can be carried out in other media, for example, in an aqueous solution[@b15]. In fact, the dynamic Leidenfrost phenomenon depends on the heat flux supplied by the interface and thickness of the thermal boundary layer of the fluid. [Figure 1a](#f1){ref-type=""fig""} and [Supplementary Movie 1](#S1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""} visualize this effect where a small cold water film on a colder substrate is suddenly introduced to a superheated plate at 300 °C and the liquid is suddenly converted to a typical Leidenfrost droplet. On spending the incubation time, the adherent layer of the liquid becomes superheated and hydrothermally explodes owing to its sudden conversion to steam. Meanwhile, primary vapour bubbles are formed and start to grow. The vaporization spreads out forward and the adherent liquid on the superheated substrate is expanded to vapour, causing a sudden drop in the hydrostatic pressure and the liquid is re-shaped as a droplet. The overheated state of the Leidenfrost phenomenon occurs and the droplet is now"

A:

I'm not 100% sure how you want the XSLT to determine from that input that the top id is 1 (is it because it's the only pid value with no corresponding cid values, or is it always 1?). Nonetheless, this should do the job:

Amit from Lester B. Pearson School Of The Arts noticed that it doesn't work for 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888 or 999. Aaron from St Stephens School built on this:
If you have a palindromic, three digit number, and you reverse it and subtract the reversed number from the original number, the [result] will be zero. If you do the second step of reversing and adding, it will be zero again. It will not be 1089.

My conjecture is that the answer to the reverse and subtract procedure is 1089 only if the number is not palindromic. If it is, then the answer to the procedure will be zero.

Lucas from Powers Hall Academy in the UK, Jasmine and Ella from Cliffedale in the UK and Jack from Chandlings explained why the result is usually 1089 by looking at the sums. This is a mixture of their explanations:Lucas: If you look, the 1st and 3rd digit cannot be the same, so the smaller number will have a larger 1s digit (as the larger number must have the larger 100s digit). You have to borrow. (998 reverse is 899. As you can see 998 has a smaller 1s digit than 899).

Jasmine and Ella: The tens digits (of the subtraction) are always the same and so [when] you borrow from the tens column, [you make] the top tens digit one less.

Then you have to borrow from the hundreds column, making [the top tens digit] nine more than the bottom tens digit, so when you take the bottom tens digit (of the subtraction) off of the top tens digit (of the subtraction) you will get nine.

Jack: When you swap them around to add the answer together, the hundreds and ones will always be number bonds to nine and when you add nine and nine it equals eighteen so you carry the one and when you add nine and one it equals ten which is why the answer is 1089

The only part that is still unexplained is why the first and third digits after the subtraction will be number bonds to 9.

Dylan from Gahanna Middle School South used the same technique, but with letters rather than numbers:
First, we have a three digit number with the reversal of it subtracted from it.
A B C
$-$ C B A
Since C is less than A we have to take one from B

A B-1 C+10
$-$ C B A

Since B-1 is less than B we will have to take 1 from A and add ten to B-1.

A-1 B+9 C+10
$-$ C B A

B+9-B=9 so the middle digit is always a nine.

NEW CONTRIBUTORY PENSION SYSTEM (NPS)

M.krishnan

Central Govt.

Employees &
Workers

Pension system was in vogue
in India for a century or more and the British Government during the
pre-independence era introduced Pension Rules for Government employees and thus
made it statutory. In the year 1982 Supreme
Court in its landmark judgement in Nakara’s case declared that -“as per
India’s constitution, Government is obliged to provide social and economic
security to pensioners and that Government retirees had the fundamental right
to pension.....Pension is not abounty nor a matter of grace depending upon
the sweet will of the employer.It is
not an ex-gratia payment, but a payment for past service rendered.It is a social welfare measure, rendering
socio-economic justice to those who in the hey days of their life, ceaselessly
toiled for their employers on the assurance that in their old age, they would
not be left in lurch.”

During the advent of
globalisation policies in 1980’s the pension reforms also started
simultaneously. IMF & World Bank started publishing so many reports and
documents emphasizing the need for pension reforms.They also started studying about the reforms
to be undertaken in the pension sector in India.In 2001,“IMF work paper on pension
reforms in India”and World Bank India specific report “India - the
challenge of old age income security”were
published. Their work reports emphasized that “Pension
obligations or promises made by the Governments which have potential of
exerting pressure on Govt. finances, have been a subject of increased
focus in
assessing medium to long term fiscal sustainability.” In tune with the
dictates of IMF and World
Bank BJP-led NDA Government appointed Bhattacharjee Committee in 2001
headed by
Ex-Chief Secretary of Karnataka, to study and recommend pension
reforms. Thus after creating ground for pension
reforms, under the pretext of implementing recommendations of
Bhattacharyya
Committee, the NDA Government introduced New Pension System called
Defined
Contributory pension system for all employees who join service on or
after 01-01-2004. The Congress-led UPA Government which came to
power in 2004 continued with the reforms and promulgated an ordinance to
legalise NPS. But UPA-I Govt. could not
pass the Pension Bill in Parliament due to stiff opposition of Left
Parties
supporting it. Later when UPA-II

Automatically generate a stacked bar chart with Dynamic Ranges?

I am looking to develop a tool for my coworkers to use that automatically generates a stacked bar chart.  I need this to work for any sized data set, for any number of Product and any number of Part.  So, I need an auto-adjusting VBA range for my macro, and I'm not sure how to do it.  
It needs to do the following:

Takes the SUM of values in a row, and logs it at the column on the end.
Creates a stacked bar chart for each of the rows. 
Go to ""Select Data"" and ""Switch Rows and Columns""
Turns the Total data values to No Fill
Makes the Total data labels show up ""Inside Base""
removes the white space from the stacked bar chart by changing the maximum of the Y-Axis.

My problems are the following:

The recording of the Macro didn't record setting the Total data selection to No Fill.  How should I do this for just the Total data points?
How do I use VBA to switch the rows and columns? 
And then finally, I am not sure how to make this macro work for any sized data set?

Overall, the survey found that 79 per cent of respondents thought immigration levels should be reduced with 59 per cent wanting a big drop.

This support for stricter border controls was shared by people from all ethnic groups, according to analysis by campaign group Migration Watch.

Home Secretary Theresa May has been pushing for a firm immigration pledge to be included in the next Tory manifesto, after the failed a pledge to cut the number coming here to 'tens of thousands'

Some 60 per cent of Asian respondents wish to see immigration reduced, with 38 per cent wanting it down by a lot.

The same is true of black respondents with 57 per cent thinking it should be curbed and 32 per cent wanting a large cut. For those of mixed origin, 60 per cent wanted a decrease with 30 per cent wanting a big fall.

Of those classed as ‘other’ ethnicities, 56 per cent wanted a drop with 32 per cent believing there should be a large reduction.

For all minority groups combined, most want lower immigration levels while about 30 per cent want them to stay the same.

Only one in ten want it to rise, making it unlikely that policies to curb immigration would deter ethnic minorities from voting for the Conservatives.

The report is a response to the centre-right lobby group Bright Blue, which claims the Tories must abandon their target to limit net migration to attract more black and ethnic minority voters.

Home Secretary Theresa May, who wants a firm pledge to cut migration in the Tory manifesto, recently quit as a member of Bright Blue’s advisory board.

A poll by Migration Watch found that 60 per cent of Asians, 57 per cent of black people, and 60 per cent of those from mixed backgrounds wanted to see a cut (pictured, pedestrians on a street in London)

Migration Watch said that while tighter immigration controls do not deter voters from an ethnic minority background, the tone of the debate must be ‘right’.

It said black and ethnic minority voters are more likely to see previous waves of immigration as positive for the UK but are clearly concerned about current levels.

47,20,15877,"1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a swash plate for a swash plate-type, variable displacement compressor for use in an automobile air conditioning system. More particularly, it relates to a boss of the swash plate.
2. Description of Related Art
A known boss of a swash plate for a swash plate-type, variable displacement compressor for use in an automobile air conditioning system is penetrated slidably by a drive shaft, and is connected slidably to a rotor fixed to the drive shaft. The boss has a penetration hole penetrated by the drive shaft, within which the drive shaft slides axially when the compressor is working under a heavy load. Consequently, the portion of the boss surrounding the penetration hole has a high degree of hardness. Therefore, in such bosses, the portion of the boss surrounding the penetration hole may be hardened by an induction hardening process or the whole of the boss may be hardened by carburizing.
If only a portion of the boss surrounding the penetration hole is hardened by the induction hardening process, the whole of the boss is made of a relatively hard material to endure the induction hardening process. However, it may become difficult to process such a boss made substantially of a relatively hard material. Moreover, in such case, the boss may become deformed because the boss is hardened only on the portion of the boss surrounding the penetration hole by induction hardening. Similarly, when the whole of the boss is hardened by carburizing, the boss may become deformed because the boss is heat-treated at a relatively high temperature. Thus, when the boss is connected securely by press-fitting within the body plate of the swash plate, the inserted portion of the boss may require reprocessing in order to restore it to its original shape because a high degree of precision is required in assembling the parts of a swash plate-type compressor. In addition, when only the portion of the boss surrounding the penetration hole is hardened by induction hardening, the inserted portion of the boss may be of the same hardness as that of the body plate because the inserted portion of the boss may not be heat-treated. Therefore, the inserted portion of the boss may bite against the body plate when the inserted portion of the boss is inserted within the body plate, and, consequently, the boss may not connect securely within the body plate.
Therefore, a need has arisen for a boss of a swash plate for a swash plate-type variable displacement compressor for use in an automobile air conditioning system that overcomes these and other shortcomings of the related art. It is technical advantage of the present invention that it facilitates the processing of the boss and that it allows the boss to connect more precisely within the body plate. In particular, the boss may connect securely by press-fitting within the body plate.
In an embodiment, this invention is a swash plate for a swash plate-type, variable displacement compressor, such that the compressor is driven by a drive shaft having a shaft axis. The swash plate comprises a boss that is penetrated slidably by the drive shaft. The boss is connected slidably to a rotor that is fixed to the drive shaft, whereby a variable, oblique angle is formed between a surface of the swash plate and the shaft axis. The boss is connected securely within the swash plate and comprises a nitrided surface layer, e.g., a layer of steel containing nitrides.
In another embodiment, this invention is a swash plate for a swash plate-type, variable displacement compressor, such that the compressor is driven by a drive shaft having a shaft axis. The swash plate comprises a boss that is penetrated slidably"

A total of 100 ng of DNA from each sample was ultra-sonicated to an average fragment size of 250 base pairs (Covaris) and further size selected using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). DNA was then manually ligated to adaptors using the KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit (KK8234, KAPA Biosystems). All libraries were purified and size selected using Agencourt AMPure XP beads to perform a double-sided solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup. The bead to DNA ratio of 0.5X was used for the high molecular weight SPRI selection followed by a 2.5X SPRI selection. Libraries were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) to ensure that all sample libraries had the expected DNA fragment size distribution. Library concentrations were quantitated using an Illumina MiSeq. Briefly, 1 μl from each library was pooled and quantitated using a Kapa Biosystems Library Quant Kit (KK4854, Kapa Biosystems), normalized to 4 nM, and then sequenced on a MiSeq nano flow cell (Illumina). The ""sequenceable"" concentration of each library was calculated by dividing the number of clusters per barcode by the average number of clusters and then multiplying the result by the qPCR value of the pooled samples. The libraries were then normalized and pooled for hybrid capture such that samples were divided into two capture reactions performed with a total of 750 ng of pooled library DNA. Capture was performed using the SureSelectXT Hybrid Capture kit with the Exon v5 bait set (Agilent Technologies). After capture, all samples were pooled together and sequenced across two lanes of a Hiseq 2500 in rapid run mode (Illumina).

The Romanian authorities would keep files on you, search your mail, make your business their business. Worse still was the suspicion that fell on anyone daring to grow their hair or wear some version of western fashion.

“Romania was a village country, you know what I mean?” he says. “There were a lot of peasants living in villages, who were working in the Securitate and Politia. They did not like the students and the people who were following the fashions like long hair. Also they were very angry against the people in the cities. They only liked folk music. And they were very, very angry against the people who were listening to other kinds of music. A lot of parents made the mistake of cutting the hair of their sons when they were sleeping – a big trauma for young people. This was the reason for lots of crime made by children against their parents. This is a fact. They made a very big mistake cutting the hair of some people. There were people who committed suicide.”

Roșca wasn’t just a record collector, he was a musician. As Rodion GA – “Romania’s first one-man band,” as he calls it – he recorded several albums’ worth of extraordinary music in the late 1970s and the 80s, giving up in 1989 after the death of his mother, Rozalia. Rodion GA managed to be prog, psychedelia, metal, electronica, often in the same song. Despite Roșca being Cluj’s leading record collector, Rodion GA sounds like he learned about music from hearing someone describe it in their second language, drunk. It sounds like nothing else: wrong in all the right ways.

At the Mercy of Idiots 4:Yahoos

In my earliest days of seriously reading on my own, which must've been during the ages of 10 or 11, my two favorite books were ""Robinson Crusoe"" by Daniel Defoe and ""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift. I can only guess how that came to be, since neither of these two English classics were from anywhere near my own times. Instead both works were already more than 200 years old, and curiously, they first saw the light of day nearly back to back -- ""Crusoe"" in 1719 and ""Gulliver"" a tad later in 1726.

I still have my copy of ""Robinson Crusoe,"" or maybe just one of the several copies that I may have had. But its pages are so yellowed and fragile that I always hesitate even to open it. So it just sits on my shelf, a favored old friend to be lightly and reverently brushed with my fingertips every 20 years or so.

So far we have several Pharaoh who married their daughters (Amenhotep III and Ramses II are certain Achnaten is another possibility).

We know both Sitamun and Iset were married to their father as were several daughters of Ramses II. Only one of those ladies had a child and that was one of Ramses II's daughters. The child is however not listed as his so must have been born to the princess outside wedlock or from a previous marriage (to???).
That is why there is speculation about the nature of the father-daughter marriages of these Pharaohs.
The daughter-wife could perform certain religious acts and was elevated by the marriage to a status higher than that of just a princess.

If Iset did have a child with her father that would make clear that at least that marriage was not just in name. It would also open up a number of new options for the family-tree of the late 18th dynasty and potential links with the early 19th dynasty.

... Children from a compound of Amenhotep III with one of his daughters are not assignable....

Arielle P. Kozloff : Amenhotep III - Egypt's Radiant Pharaoh. - Cambridge : University Press, 2012. - 370 p. On page 194 it is supposed that there is an indication of a possible son of Sitamun. On a relief that Petrie during his excavations in Thebes West, in the House for Millions of Years for Amenhotep II, has found (Petrie, Six Temples at Thebes, 1897, p. 6) we see Sitamun with name in cartouche and vulture headdress:

refuses an assignment to the daughter of Amenhotep III on stylistic grounds of the relief work, as I personally find convincing. He assigns the fragment in the time of Amenhotep II and sees here the daughter of Ahmes-Nefertari and sister of Amenhotep I, the God's Wife Satamun. She turns up in Theban tombs and temples in different lineages. Obviously, she was therefore particularly venerated in ancestor worship.

It could therefore be once part of one of the earliest representations of the worship of the ancestors of the 18th Dynasty. The inscription ""Lords of eternity, Great one of infinity"" in the tomb of xaj-Inj-Hnt to a similar line of sitting ancestor royality from the early 18th Dynasty explains the royal ornat.

Another possibility is that Iset was the GRW of Amenhotep IV as co-regent and may be KV35YL.

Pure speculation, but Amenhotep IV fathered Tutankhamun with a full sister who must surely have had GRW status at some point.

Why ""must"" she ""surely have had""?

In TT 192 - Kheruef we find some of the earliest representations of Amenhotep IV, offering alone in front of his parents - but also offering in front of his father, accompanied by his mother the Great Royal Wife Tiye. If he still had a Great Royal Wife already at its own should not this queen be pictured together with him in these scenes (even more when she was a daughter of Amenhotep III and Teje)?

Kozloff mentions ""another small fragment"" with ""the head of a young prince wearing one lock of hair braided to the side."". She is seeing in this prince a son of Sitamun. Why (stile? direct connection scene?) she explains not.

Greetings, Lutz.

We have also the example of Bintanath depicted both as King's Daughter and Great Royal Wife alongside with the King's Sons Ramesses, Khaemwaset and Merneptah who, however, are not her children.

“Step Up to the Mic,” the video-streaming app’s new elimination-style singing competition featuring host judges Quavo and Takeoff of Migos, along with hit songwriter Starrah and producer Murda Beatz, is an ambitious program for the app, offering a head-turning prize for the winner.

Like the many singing competitions that came before it, such as ABC’s “American Idol” and NBC’s “The Voice,” “Step Up to the Mic” is offering the winner a chance to kickstart a music career through a record deal at a major label along with a management deal. A representative for Triller tells Rolling Stone that the app has agreements from all the major labels to sign the winning contestant, and the label will be decided based on fit.

Triller’s own twist, however, is offering up the competition’s hosts for the winner’s first song. Whoever wins will perform a song featuring Quavo and Takeoff, written by Starrah and produced by Murda Beatz. The winner gets a music video shoot for the song too. Contestants have been submitting videos on the platform since May 8th, and the submission period closes on May 29th. Fans will vote on their picks throughout the series, with voting starting the week of June 5th. The star judges along with fans will ultimately decide the final winner, who will be announced July 10th.

“I’m looking for the next superstar, that sauce, drip, something special.” Quavo tells Rolling Stone over the phone this week. “You’re working with superstars. You’re in front of the greatest group in the world, the greatest group of all time, you’re working with one of the greatest writers in the world, Starrah’s an amazing writer. And you’re working with Murda Beatz whose got countless hits with all the superstars across the globe and started with us.”

Contestants should have “mamba mentality,” Takeoff adds. “We’re looking for someone with confidence, has fire, someone who’s excited to work with the Migos, and my boy Murda and Starrah and make this a moment.”

Regarding having to keep the contest online through a screen rather than in-person, the two Migos members say they have no worries on getting the right choice for a feature. As Quavo says, “raw sauce is raw sauce.”

Compared to artists who have been consistently taking to livestreams and digital performances through the safer at home orders, save for the release of “Taco Tuesday” on Cinco de Mayo, Migos had been relatively quiet amid the quarantine. They’ve been busy recording new music from their studio at home, and the group released new track “Need It” featuring YoungBoy Never Broke Again on Friday. Meanwhile, Quavo got his high school diploma amid safer at home orders, he says. (“I dropped out of school back in ’09,” he raps over the phone in a rhythm reminiscent of his signature triplet. “2020, that’s when I got mine.”)

Planning for “Step Up to the Mic” started before the pandemic struck the U.S., but the very nature of the competition’s all online production helps avoid complications television productions have faced. “Step Up to the Mic” isn’t the only performance competition going online through the pandemic; “The Voice” wrapped up its most recent season this week through a line set up via Microsoft Teams to maintain social distancing.

Streaming on social media has been dominant through the pandemic, with apps like TikTok gaining significant boosts in downloads. Triller — a TikTok competitor — has seen a surge in usage through the health crisis as well; the company says it’s had a 500% increase in user engagement since the pandemic struck.

“For the first time in the history of music we have a digital platform that transcends stardom. Whether you’re a rapper or a vocalist, Triller’s goal is to make sure everyone’s voice"

A few nights ago, I sat down to watch a ‘feel good’ movie with Leigha. It was a present that Leigha had got for Christmas and after another crazy food shop before the new years eve antics. It seemed like the perfect thing to do to round off the day.

Nothing could have prepared me for how I would feel about the film – Eddie the Eagle the Movie.

For those of you too young to remember who Eddie the Eagle actually is; he was born Michael Edwards, in Cheltenham, England in 1963 and nickname Eddie by his friends. Edward’s always dreamed of being an Olympian, trying out a range of sports as a child; he finally found this craft in skiing…

…but when he failed to qualify as a downhill skier for the 1984 winter Olympics team, he found another route to his Olympic glory in the form of ski jumping; something no UK skier had done since 1928!

The wonderful thing about Eddie’s story is not just his grit and determination but the fact that so much was stacked against him. As a child he had braces on his legs right up until adolescence. He had no coach or money to support himself to become the Olympian he aspired to be. Where most ski jumpers would have been training from the age of 4. Eddie picked up the sport at 22 and trained for about 18 months prior to his Olympic debut.

Things I learnt from Eddie the Eagle.

Keep Your Dreams Close.

One of the main things that struck me about Eddie’s story was that he never gave up on his dream. He had that goal and vision in his mind from such a young age. He knew he would be an Olympian and he never wavered from that premise even when everyone around him was telling him otherwise.

(Before you read this, do keep in mind that I have not endorsed anyone and I’m not going to pull any punches. So if you can’t stand the idea of someone saying something negative about your favorite candidate, you should probably stop now.)

Right off the bat, it’s worth noting that this is a better field to choose from than we had in 2008. Back then, we had Duncan Hunter (whom I worked for), Fred Thompson, and a bunch of other guys it was impossible to get excited about. Unlike a lot of conservatives, I was at least lukewarm on Mike Huckabee, but I really didn’t like Romney or Giuliani and McCain made my skin crawl. This time around, the field’s better, but the number of potentially viable candidates is probably a little smaller, too. In fact, barring Sarah Palin’s entry into the race or a Rick Perry meltdown, this is perilously close to turning into a two person race already. Let’s start with the front-runner…

So, he’s definitely the front runner and could certainly win, BUT — and this is a big but — his lead is more fragile than he looks.

107. People of England: Prince William and Catherine Middleton

The wedding between Prince William and Catherine Middleton seems to have magnetized people from all over the world. Millions of people have been ""glued"" to their TV screens to watch the beautiful royal wedding.

Prince William was born on June 21, 1982, the elder son of Princess Diana and Prince Charles. He received his education in four schools of the UK and completed his degree at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Following his mother's example William was involved into a variety of charities, raising awareness of AIDS/HIV, working with inner-city disadvantaged groups, granting patronage to a charity that assists the homeless people. He also made his contribution by working with the less-fortunate children in Africa and raising funds for a number of social and environmental causes in the country and overseas. William has participated in fund-raising events playing polo and football, and both he and his brother share a passion for riding motorbikes and following foxhounds on their hunts.

William met Catherine Middleton at the University of St. Andrews and they started dating in 2003. Even though their relationship was in peril at some point they were able to overcome their problems. In 2010 an announcement was made regarding their engagement. Prince William and Kate Middleton were married on April 29, 2011 at Westminster Abbey. The Archbishop of Canterbury officiated their ceremony. Listen to his talk on the meaning and mystery of marriage and complete the assignments below.

The 2)______ from the Lambeth Palace is straight across the houses of Parliament, Big Ben, and, of course, Westminster Abbey. And at the moment Westminster Abbey is very much on everybody’s 3)______ as we look forward to the Royal Wedding.

Every marriage is a really big commitment to the people 4)________. It’s a lifetime commitment. It’s a commitment that says, “Actually I’m prepared not only to 5)________ the rest of my life with you, but to spend the rest of my life 6)________ _____ about you; there’s always going to be more of you to discover. And if that’s what people are saying to each other in a wedding that says something very deeply 7)__________ about what human beings are like. There’s a 8)_________, a delight at the heart of the human beings, and it’s possible to spend a lifetime and more 9)_________ just that.

A marriage is, of course, is 10)_______ and foremost about two individuals, but no individual exists alone. People come to their weddings with families and friends around them, and of course in this 11)__________ wedding they’re coming with friends and 12)__________ from all around the world, watching and witnessing. Every wedding then sends a 13)_______ to people. It’s two people declaring something, not only about themselves, but about what they most deeply believe, the 14)_________ they most deeply hold to, declaring that to the whole world around.

A marriage is good news because it says something so deep about our 15)__________, and it tells us that we can have 16)___________ for hope, that there are still people around who want to spend the rest of their lives with each other, who want to make this act of 17)___________ commitment to one another. And so everybody around the world watching this will have some sense of the commitments that are possible.

People who are witnessing the wedding are 18)__________, I think, to ask themselves, “Well, if William and Catherine can make that sort of commitment, if these people can share that sort of 19)_____________, perhaps I’m more capable of more generosity, more commitment, more faithfulness, more 20)______________ than I ever thought, perhaps there’s more to me than I ever realized.”"

The DCT circuit 153 converts the image data into frequency components, and performs DCT on the subtraction result supplied from the subtracting circuit 151 to acquire a DCT coefficient. The quantization circuit 154 quantizes the DCT coefficient supplied from the DCT circuit 153 based on a predetermined quantization value.
The encoding circuit further includes an inverse quantization circuit 158, an inverse DCT circuit 159, an addition circuit 160, and a frame memory 161. The inverse quantization circuit 158 inversely quantizes the data supplied from the quantization circuit 154. The inverse DCT circuit 159 performs an inverse DCT on the data supplied from the inverse quantization circuit 158 (the restored DCT coefficient). The addition circuit 160 adds the data supplied from the inverse DCT circuit 159 (image data) and predictive image data. The frame memory 161 stores the addition result of the addition circuit 160 as reference image data.
The encoding circuit further includes a motion compensation circuit 162, a motion vector detecting circuit 163, a switch 164, and a control circuit 166. The motion vector detecting circuit 163 detects a motion vector based on the image data output from the preprocessing circuit 151 and the reference image data stored in the frame memory 161. The motion compensation circuit 162 performs motion compensation on the reference image data stored in the frame memory 161 based on the motion vector detected by the motion vector detecting circuit 163 to generate reference image data for motion compensation as predictive image data.
The control circuit 166 determines whether or not to encode the image data supplied from the preprocessing circuit 151 as an intra picture, and switches the switch 164 based on the determined result.
When the control circuit 166 determines to encode the image data supplied from the preprocessing circuit 151 as an intra picture, the switch 164 is switched to supply data “0” to the subtracting circuit 152 and the addition circuit 160 based on a switching signal applied from the control circuit 166. On the other hand, when the control circuit 166 determines to encode the image data supplied from the preprocessing circuit 151 as a non-intra picture, the switch 164 is switched to supply the predictive image data generated by the motion compensation circuit 162 to the subtracting circuit 152 and the addition circuit 160 based on the switching signal applied from the control circuit 166.
Consequently, the subtraction result supplied from the subtracting circuit 152 is the image data itself when the image data is encoded as an intra picture, and is the differential image data obtained by using the predictive image data when the image data is encoded as a non-intra picture.
The encoding circuit further includes a variable length encoding circuit 155, a multiplexing circuit 156, a buffer 157, and a rate control circuit 165. The variable length encoding circuit 155 performs variable length encoding on the data supplied from the quantization circuit 154. The multiplexing circuit 156 multiplexes encoded data supplied from the variable length encoding circuit 155 (such as a DCT coefficient, a quantization value supplied from the quantization circuit 154, a picture type, and the like), the motion vector, and the like.

The higher-order Laplacians are independent on the orientation of the simplices as long as the orientation of the simplices is induced by the label of the nodes. The degeneracy of the zero eigenvalue of the $n$ Laplacian ${\bf L}_{[n]}$ is equal to the Betti number $\beta_n$. The eigenvectors associated to the zero eigenvalue of the $n$-Laplacian are localized on the corresponding $n$-dimensional cavities of the simplicial complex. [Therefore, the higher-order Laplacians with $n>0$ are not guaranteed to have a zero eigenvalue as simplicial complexes with $\beta_n=0$ for some $n>0$ exist.]{} In particular, if the topology of the simplicial complex is trivial, i.e. $\beta_0=1$ and $\beta_n=0$ for all $n>0,$ the Laplacians of order $n>0$ do not admit a zero eigenvalue.

Another important property of the $n$-Laplacian is that each non-zero eigenvalue is either a non-zero eigenvalue of the $n$-order up-Laplacian or is a non-zero eigenvalue of the $n$-order down-Laplacian.

I was given a 3Gs yesterday, it was my brother's old iphone he had while living in Australia. Can I use it in New Zealand where I live?

I went to Vodafone and Telecom today... one guy told me to unlock it and another told me to jailbreak it. I have been reading threads online for the last few hours to figure it out myself but I am honestly confused.

Can someone please point me in the right direction as I am scared that I may damage it in the process of trying to fix it. All I want to use the iphone for is texting, calling, music and photos. I am not interested in connecting it to the internet.

As you probably have gathered, this all new to me so please explain what I need to do in the most basic language possible. I don't really understand all this tech terminology.

I would try popping a sim in first to see if it will work. If it doesn't then you will likely have to unlock it to get it working. Unlocking means that you are going take the phone and change the carrier that it was originally assigned to.

If your brother got it through a Telco it could well be locked to that Telco. But most phones are unlocked here in Aust, so i would first find out if it is unlocked. If it is you can use it anywhere in the world you wish too.
Will you be Staying in NZ?? Are you in NZ now?? (Presume you are as you went to Telecom, which we dont have in Aust)
Find out from your brother what he dod when he first got it.....
Being Non Techie i wouldnt JB it but try to get it unlocked if it is locked....
Post back we will work it out for ya

Wow! Thank you both for replying so quickly! As you can imagine I am dying to get it up and running

I put my Vodafone (NZ) sim card in but itunes tells me ""it is not a supported carrier"".

Yes, I live in NZ.

My brother had it on contract with Vodafone Australia. He has since upgraded. He took it to Vodafone in Australia a few weeks ago, explained he was giving it to me in NZ and they ""cleaned/cleared"" it. My brother is not that tech savvy either as you can tell. Basically he said that Vodafone Australia did whatever they could do.

Yea mate sounds like it is locked to Aust Vodafone. Next step is to go into the Telco you want to connect to (vodafone) and see how much it will cost for them to unlock it for you...
Sound like the only option for you ATM

OR JailBreak it if you have the Knowledge or Knowhow or a mate that is tech savvy lol
But for you a Unlock would be the way to go

Good luck and keep us posted

History

Hyderabad was founded by the Quṭb Shāhi sultans of Golconda, under whom the kingdom of Golconda attained a position of importance second only to that of the Mughal Empire in the north. The old fortress town of Golconda had proved inadequate as the kingdom’s capital, and so about 1591 Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shāhi, the fifth of the Quṭb Shāhis, built a new city called

Weber : What is the significance of this?

Bohm : It would be part of a view that says that the whole principle of movement is that it contains this end in view, so that it would be quite natural to put the laws in that form. There are some laws, when put in that form, that are indistinguishable from laws of a mechanical nature.

Weber : So that the mechanical laws can mask or cover up these teleological ones.

Bohm : They are a special case of the teleological laws. It will not work the other way round.

Weber : But to you, the teleological laws are primary and the mechanical laws may in fact be teleological, the universe’s way of implementing its purpose. Is that the idea?

Bohm : Yes, that is what I am proposing.

Weber : So the cosmology you’re proposing is meaning, inherently.

Bohm : Yes. In that sense, meaning is the essence of reality.

Weber : That’s a marvelous thought. If someone were to try to pin you down and say ‘What is the meaning of it: is it development, is it self-awareness through time and variety,’ what would you answer?

Bohm : We have to discover that. There is no fixed meaning. That is its characteristic, that there is no final meaning. The whole point of meaning is that the content is in a context, which in turn is in a context, and therefore meaning is not final. We are always discovering it, and that discovery of meaning is itself a part of the reality.

Weber : The discovery of meaning, and the creation of meaning. Of course the question is: Do we discover meaning or do we create meaning?

Bohm : We can look at it both ways. We discover meaning in some sense, but whatever we discover we also create some idea as to how we are going to put it—the way it is going to be abstracted from the context.

Weber : In your earlier implicate order philosophy you proposed terms like intelligence, order and compassion when applied to the universe as a whole. Would those be a part of the meaning of the universe as it unfolds itself?

Bohm : Yes, intelligence is part of this process of the perception of meaning. In fact when you say ‘I understand’ you really say I see the whole meaning of this.’

Weber : You say that if meaning changes, being changes. Does this mean that as we understand, as this holomovement understands itself more deeply and more in detail through history, its being becomes clearer or fuller?

Bohm : Yes. A change of order. Any change of understanding is a change of being, at least of the creatures who are doing it and of all that they affect.

Weber : Isn’t this analogous to Hegel?

Bohm : Yes, I think the point Hegel made was that analysis doesn’t necessarily mean breaking things into bits, but rather unfolding the meaning. He made the interesting point that analysis is at the same time synthesis, because when you have unfolded the meaning, the being has changed and something has been added to it. It unfolds a meaning which is another order of being.

Weber : That’s the synthesis.

Bohm : Yes, the analysis is at the same time a synthesis.

Weber : It also unifies things.

Bohm : There is a larger being which includes the analysis and the material analyzed. Instead of saying that the analysis is just about the thing analyzed, the analysis is a change in the thing analyzed.

Weber : So this links change, permanence, development and significance, all in one?

Bohm : Yes.

Weber : You are after all a quantum physicist. Is meaning in some way analogous to energy, or could it be like the charge on matter?

78,28,5590,"Perhaps the time to give Dayton Moore his due has long since come, not just because his team won an American League pennant -- believe me, as someone who grew up a fan of the Athletics, it would be nice if Team Moneyball could say even that much at some point during the past 15 years. No, it’s because it looks as if the Royals’ GM is a man who has a sense of the moment. It’s reasonable to wonder if Moore -- long lampooned for his commitment to “the Process"" -- is enjoying some revenge served like a bowl of gazpacho: cold and tasty.

The reason I’m wondering is, with the Royals’ announcement that they have conclusively inked a two-year, $20 million deal with right-hander Edinson Volquez, it looks like they’re effectively done making major moves this winter. That’s not automatically a good or a bad thing for a defending pennant-winner. Some contending teams’ GMs have wrapped up even earlier in years past (here’s looking at you, Ruben Amaro), and sometimes you don’t have to wait on the market because you have just a move or two to make.

Dayton Moore has been the Royals GM since 2006. John Rieger/USA TODAY Sports

But when you review what the Royals did this winter to address what needed doing, I think you have to credit Dayton Moore with an excellent job of moving on the team’s areas of concern or weakness to sustain Kansas City’s ability to contend into the future. Really -- there’s no punchline -- Dayton Moore did this. The Royals are going to win more games as a result.

What did they need after winning the AL pennant? That’s simple: The Royals needed power after finishing last in the majors with a.113 ISO -- behind all the NL teams that regularly have to bat their pitchers. That would involve replacing fading DH Billy Butler in the lineup and, ideally, adding some right-handed power to help balance a lineup armed with a trio of home-grown lefty thumpers in Alex Gordon, Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas. They needed to replace staff ace James Shields in the rotation -- no easy feat when the free agent was taking his team-leading 24 quality starts in 34 turns to the market -- which potentially undermines a Royals rotation that had ranked second in the AL in quality starts in 2014, with 95.

Moore’s solutions might put the Royals in better shape than if he’d simply tried to maintain the status quo. Credit him for being like a latter-day Whitey Herzog and using last year’s wins to help purchase multiple big improvements. Rather than get carried away with Lorenzo Cain’s postseason heroics or Jarrod Dyson’s speed, he didn’t leave full-time slots open for both guys in the lineup, with Nori Aoki leaving. Instead, he addressed the Royals’ power outage by signing Alex Rios (.166 career ISO) to man right field and Kendrys Morales (.189 career) to DH. Adding power in traditional power slots might be the oldest formula in the transactions playbook, but who said there’s anything wrong with the classics? Add in Rios’ value on defense, and the Royals didn’t sacrifice much more than Glass cash to help keep a good thing going.

In the rotation, Moore didn’t settle for a one-for-one swap in the hope that would solve a potentially big problem. Instead, he improved his team’s depth by signing recuperating Kris Medlen, as well as Volquez. Medlen, recovering from Tommy John surgery, took a back-loaded deal that only gets into serious cash ($10 million) in 2017 on a mutual option or if he earns performance bonuses of up to $10 million in 2015 and 2016. Even with the longer recovery you might expect from a second Tommy John surgery, he should be available in the second half and have the opportunity -- thanks to the Royals’ deep bullpen -- to be handled carefully.

The Volquez deal might deliver more quickly, but that depends how much value you invest in his stretch run and how much he’ll take from his association with the Pirates and their growing list of retread success stories. (Jerry Crasnick reported on this in back in April.) Volquez gave the Pirates 19 quality starts in 31 turns last year, while cutting his walk rate and generating his best clip groundball outs since 2011. Although he got a lot of help from the Pirates’ defenders (.269 BABIP), pitching in front of the Royals’ quality D should help mitigate concerns over regression on this front. Add in that he’s still throwing heat that"
79,19,16542," is also capable of computing the higher-order quantum loop-level effects. Furthermore the method is designed to provide probabilistic quantities, i.e. the rates or cross-sections, hence it goes beyond just the calculation of the amplitudes near or on the mass-thresholds by also taking account of the integrations over the $n$-particle Lorentz-invariant phase space. The approach of [@Son] generalised to field theory the Landau WKB method [@Landau] for computing matrix elements of certain generic local operators between the initial and final states with different energy eigenvalues. In our case, the initial state is a vacuum and the final state is the $n$-particle final state with $n\gg 1$. It is known that to the leading exponential accuracy the transition rates computed using the Landau WKB method do not depend on the specific form of the operator ${\cal O}(x)$ used to deform the initial state, if this deformation is not exponential. It is then similarly expected that the choice of the operator does not affect the transition rates in the QFT settings either, and the approach of [@Son] generalises the Landau WKB method to a scalar QFT using the path integral formalism.

The central quantity is the dimensionless probability rate ${\cal R}_n(E)$ for a local operator ${\cal O}$ to create $n$ particles of total energy $E$ from the vacuum. It is given by [@Son], $${\cal R}_n(E)\,=\, \int d\Phi_n\, \langle 0| \,{\cal O}^\dagger \, S^\dagger\, P_E |n\rangle 
\langle n|\, P_E\, S\, {\cal O}\, |0\rangle\,,
\label{eq:RnE1}$$ where the matrix element involves the operator ${\cal O}$ between the vacuum state $ |0\rangle$ and the $n$-particle state of fixed energy $\langle n|\, P_E $ (here $P_E$ is the projection operator on states with fixed energy $E$), along with the $S$ matrix to evolve between the initial and finial times. The matrix element is squared and integrated over the $n$-particle Lorentz-invariant phase space $\Phi_n$ $$\int d\Phi_{n} \,=\, \frac{1}{n!}\,(2\pi)^4 \delta^{(4)}(P_{\rm in}-\sum_{j=1}^n p_j) \,
 \prod_{j=1}^n \int \frac{d^3 p_j}{(2\pi)^3\, 2 p_j^0} \,.
 \label{eq:phase-sp}$$ Note that in our conventions the bosonic phase-space volume element includes the $1/n!$ symmetry factor for the production of the $n$ equivalent Higgs bosons.[^2]

The local operator ${\cal O}$ appearing in the matrix elements in is usually chosen to be [@Son] $${\cal O} \,=\,{e^{j\,h(0)}}\,,$$ where $j$ is a constant, and the limit $j\to 0$ is taken in the computation of the probability rates, $${\cal R}_n(E)\,=\, \lim_{j\to 0} \int d\Phi_n\, \langle 0| \,{e^{j\,"

You're in the ER three days after you saw the case, and the charge nurse takes you aside: ""Remember that weird chest pain dude? He came back in arrest/is in the ICU on a ventilator/needs a transplant/was found dead at home/etc."" You sit down and take a deep breath and commence feeling terrible. Then you get scared. Then you start rationalizing. But mostly you feel guilty because it was your responsibility to take care of that guy and he died because of you.

You get a phone call from Risk Management. The family has made contact with the hospital and would like to undergo a disclosure, and your participation is considered essential to defusing the situation.

You get a certified letter with an attorney's return address.

So when the WSJ reporter asked me why I made the defensive decision -- wasn't it just the fear of getting sued? Nope. It's a fear, and a significant one. But it's possibly the least likely of all the bad things that happen when you are wrong. If you've been sued, especially if you thought it was frivolous, or you lost, or if you know someone who's lost big, that fear is magnified beyond its real probability. But it's just one disincentive among many, and even if you eliminated the possiblity of getting sued (or reduced it greatly, as they have in Texas), there are still so many ""punishments"" for an ""error"" that I suspect that the cost of Defensive Medicine will change little.

Trying to isolate and quantify the blame for each particular unnecessary test just isn't possible.

Still, $60 billion is a reasonable enough guess, and trying to reduce that cost is, as Leonhardt says, a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the real problem with our medical malpractice system isn't that it costs too much. The real problem is that it's a lottery. Some people get money they don't deserve because it's cheaper to settle with them even if their claims are frivolous. But far more people who are victims of genuine malpractice never sue and never get a dime. A genuinely fair reform, one that cut frivolous malpractice suits but also did a better job of compensating everyone who was genuinely injured, would almost certainly end up costing us more, not less.

Exactly so. (Emphasis added. I think Kevin used a more expansive definition of ""malpractice"" than I might.) The current medical malpractice system is in dire need of reform: it's slow, inefficient and unfair. The inflated med-mal insurance premiums I pay harm me and my practice as truly as the failure to compensate them harms patients who were injured. But those who think that it will significantly ""bend the curve"" and make inroads to controlling health care costs are mistaken.

Fun coda: the example patient cited was real, from the other day. He truly had no cardiac risk factors and very atypical pain. I seriously considered sending him home. He ruled in for an evolving MI. Score one for defensive medicine.

While the current system is slow, it's not really that inaccurate. But really, your post while informative is not particularly relevant. Why? Two reasons:

1) current reform proposals are only about caps. Because they're drafted and primarily backed by insurers, with physicians as the face of them. Insurers have no desire to pay people more or faster, regardless of the legitimacy of the claims.

2) single payer renders this moot as we will likely end up with a workers comp style no fault system. And, with people no longer worrying about medical bills, a major reason to file a malpractice claim is gone. Downside for docs is that the govt is going to punish them anyway for"

Charlie felt a deep and satisfying pluck when Ethan’s expression faltered at the scar. The same feeling a cutter might get when the bite of a blade released a bead of blood; a self-inflicted, satisfying ping of pain.

I think I can see what this story is about, but it becomes lost in the moments that pull back to the wider wedding party. From what I can see, this story is about Charlie and the beginning of this scene is really about Charlie, Max, and Alexander. Keep it on them. Like in a movie, start with a broader establishing narrative and then focus in one just the three of them. There's a few too many side characters that I quickly became tangled by. It also takes away from the cattiness/back-and-forth between Max and Alexander.

If I may, I don't know if doing this is considered impolite or something on this site, but I reworked the very first part, at the ceremony, in a way that makes it more clear for me and puts all of the focus on Charlie, leading to the reader wondering what Charlie has against weddings.

Sorry if this is wrong of me, but I'm just trying to help. I only worked on this for a short time, but then I had the advantage of you already doing the hard part, which was coming up with the story. Anyway, please take it with the kindness it's intended. I'm wondering what's next with this woman.

---------------------

Charlie’s anxiety attack, in its infancy during the canapes and cocktails, grew up [note: it's a baby/child] into a tantrum-throwing toddler by the time the guests were seated for the ceremony. She had trouble catching her breath, so she tried bending at the waist to put her head between her knees, but her dress was so tight that she could only tilt forward slightly, giving the appearance of quiet contemplation to anyone who might be gazing in her direction. Fortunately, everyone was too busy focusing on the glorious wedding procession as it moved down the center aisle.

“Is she okay?” Alexander asked. “Is that dress too tight?”

“It’s not the dress.”

Max fanned Charlie vigorously with his program.

A young woman in the [row/pew] before them turned and shushed them sharply. When she turned away again, Max and Alexander made faces at her. Alex thought to say something but one of the passing bridesmaids left a citrusy, throat-tightening cloud in her wake.

“God, I hope she doesn't pass out,” Alex croaked once he regained his own ability to speak.

“You know how much she hates weddings,” Max said, trying to work a button free in the back, finding that Charlie’s dress was, in fact, a little too tight. He moved himself so that Alex could not see that he was having trouble.

“You dressed her like a stupid doll, is what you did, nipping in the waist like that.”

“It’s not the dress, it’s this wedding. Don't blame the dress just because you talked her into coming.”

“Jess would've had a [fit/cow/seizure] if Charlie didn’t come.”

“I’m sitting right here,” Charlie managed to say between moments of thoughtful consideration of vomiting.

Please don’t throw up! Please don’t throw up! she begged.

“Oh, God! She’s turning green,” Max whispered with alarm.

84,27,13030,"WASHINGTON — Republicans pushed a scaled-down farm bill through the House on Thursday, putting off a fight over food stamp spending and giving GOP leaders a victory after a decisive defeat on the larger bill last month.

Republicans faced significant opposition to the plan from Democrats, farm groups and conservative groups that threatened to use the vote against GOP members in future campaigns. But Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., navigated his colleagues to a narrow 216-208 vote by convincing Republican members that this was the best chance to get the bill passed and erase the embarrassment of the June loss.

Any other path to passage would have most likely included concessions to Democrats who opposed the original bill.

Last month 62 Republicans voted against a broader bill after House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Cantor supported it. Only 12 Republicans voted against the new measure, and no Democrats voted for it.

Republicans said the food stamp part of the legislation would be dealt with separately at a later date, and Cantor said after the vote that Republicans would “act with dispatch” to get that legislation to the floor. That bill is expected to make cuts much deeper than the original bill, which trimmed around 3 percent, or about $2 billion a year, from the $80 billion-a-year feeding program.

Many Republicans had said the cut wasn’t enough since the program’s cost has doubled in the last five years. Democrats have opposed any cuts. The food stamp program doesn’t need legislation to continue, but Congress would have to pass a bill to enact changes.

Dropping the food stamps drops the cost of the farm bill from $100 billion a year to about $20 billion a year.

The measure passed Thursday would cut farm program spending by about $1.3 billion a year and is almost identical to the larger bill defeated last month, except for the dropped food stamp language. It includes one new provision that repeals laws from the 1930s and 1940s that kick in when current farm law expires. Farm-state lawmakers have kept those laws on the books so there would be incentive to pass new farm bills, but the threat of outdated policies kicking in has been a headache for farmers who worry they can’t depend on Congress to create new laws or extend more recent versions of the law.

Repealing those decades-old laws could mean that Congress would have little incentive to create new farm bills, however, and could make many of the new farm programs permanent.

The bill would also expand government subsidies for crop insurance, rice and peanuts, and eliminate subsidies that are paid whether a recipient farms or not.

During debate Thursday, House Democrats called for a series of procedural votes to delay a vote. They painted the legislation as taking food stamps away from the hungry.

Late Wednesday, President Barack Obama had threatened to veto the House bill if reached his desk.

In voting for the bill, conservative lawmakers made the unusual move of bucking the conservative groups Club for Growth and Heritage Action, both of which said they would use a “yes” vote against Republicans in future campaigns. While those groups originally supported the idea of dropping food stamps and taking that part of the bill up separately, they later said the GOP idea was a ruse to get the bill in conference with the Democrat-led Senate, where food stamps will be added back in with smaller cuts.

The Senate overwhelmingly passed a farm bill last month with only a half-percent cut to food stamps and would be reluctant to go along with a split bill or further cuts to the programs. After House passage, Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., called the bill “an insult to rural America.”

House and Senate negotiators will have to resolve differences between the two bills.

Splitting the popular farm bill from the controversial food stamp cuts and releasing the bill’s text at 8 p.m. on the eve of Thursday’s scheduled vote denied conservatives the time to rally opposition. But the bill’s prospects remained a tense question through the day.

Before the vote, Boehner acknowledged that the process was unusual but said, “My goal right now is to get a farm bill passed.”

The White House agreed that food stamps should not be left out of the bill. The Obama administration had also threatened to veto the original bill, saying it did not include enough reductions to farm subsidies and the food stamp cuts were too severe.

Farm groups and anti-hunger groups have warned that"
85,6,4551," from all debts referred to in the separation agreement.  The district court affirmed these findings and conclusions.


13
The findings and conclusions of the bankruptcy judge, which were not disturbed by the district court, must be sustained by this court unless found to be clearly erroneous.  In re Solomon, 506 F.2d 463 (7th Cir. 1974); In re Northern Illinois Development Corp., 324 F.2d 104 (7th Cir. 1963).


14
That the award was termed a ""property settlement"" and did not purport to grant ""alimony,"" in the general sense, to Judith is not dispositive, for it is the basis for creation of the obligation which determines whether it was intended as an equalization of property rights or as support and maintenance.  Nichols v. Hensler, 528 F.2d 304 (7th Cir. 1976); White v. White, 338 N.E.2d 749 (Ind.App.1975).  The record before the bankruptcy judge and the district court consisted of a copy of the divorce decree and that separation agreement incorporated therein, but does not conclusively reveal the intent of the divorce court or of the parties in including the disputed term.  The law of Indiana, therefore, determines whether Woods' assumption of the parties' debts is to be construed as dividing the marital property or as providing support for Judith.4  Nichols, supra; Desjardins v. Desjardins, 193 F.Supp. 210, 213 (E.D.Ky.1961), aff'd as modified, 308 F.2d 111 (6th Cir. 1962).


15
In Nichols, supra, this court addressed the issue of the actual nature of an alimony award in Indiana, and noted the dichotomy surrounding that question which is evidenced in Indiana case law.  One line of cases emphasizes an award to a spouse as purely a property settlement.  See, e. g., Shula v. Shula, 235 Ind. 210, 132 N.E.2d 612 (1956); Eppley v. Eppley, 341 N.E.2d 212 (Ind.App.1976).  Another group of cases recognizes the support and maintenance aspects of an alimony award.  See, e. g., Wellington v. Wellington, 304 N.E.2d 347 (Ind.App.1973); White v. White, 338 N.E.2d 749 (Ind.App.1975); Stanford v. Stanford, 352 N.E.2d 93 (Ind.App.1976).  However, an analysis of the elements considered by the Indiana courts in determining that an award is for future support demonstrates that this agreement can be construed only as a present and complete settlement of the respective property rights of the parties.5


16
First, the agreement makes absolutely no provision for payment of any kind to Judith.  The obligation to pay bills incurred during the marriage assumed by Woods benefits Judith too tenuously and indirectly to have been undertaken for her future support.  By contrast, Indiana cases considering an award as support invariably involve payment of money, either in gross or periodically, or transfer of property directly to the spouse to be supported.  See, e. g., Wellington, supra; White, supra; Stanford, supra; Ceiga v. Ceiga, 114 Ind.App. 205, 51 N.E.2d 493 (1943); McDaniel v. McDaniel, 245 Ind. 551, 201 N.E.2d 215 (1964); Boshonig v. Boshonig, 148 Ind.App. 496, 267 N.E.2d 555 (1971).  Cf. Nichols, supra.  Second, the provision creating the obligation at issue occurs in the midst of provisions allocating property between the parties, and is not separate therefrom or additional thereto.  Nichols, supra at 308.  Third, there is no indication that this term was intended to balance the relative income of the parties.  Nichols, supra at 308.  No children whom Woods is obligated to support are involved; only the support of Judith is at issue.  While the record evinces a difference of approximately $38.00 per week between the parties' net incomes, this disparity is not so gross so that it must be presumed by this court that the disputed term is tantamount to an allowance for support.  Compare Stanford, supra; Boshonig, supra; Ceiga, supra.  Finally, the agreement makes no provision for payment of a fixed sum and no specification by the court regarding the character and method of payment, i. e., whether in gross or in periodic payments, as seems to be required by Indiana law.  Ind.Code § 31-1-12-17, repealed September 1, 1973.  See White, supra at 753; Boshonig, supra, 148"

88,20,16385,"Kirk Varnedoe

John Kirk Train Varnedoe (January 18, 1946 – August 14, 2003) was an American art historian, the Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art from 1988 to 2001, Professor of the History of Art at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and Professor of Fine Arts at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts.

Biography
Varnedoe was born and raised in Savannah, Georgia, and attended Savannah Country Day School.  He studied at St. Andrew's School and Williams College, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. At Williams he began studying studio art, but soon switched to art history under the influence of Professor Lane Faison, and received his A.B. in 1967. He also played college football and, after graduating, returned to work as a coaching assistant and to lead art history discussion sections for a year.

In 1972 Varnedoe earned a Ph.D. at Stanford under Rodin scholar Albert Elsen, with whom he collaborated on an exhibition and catalog, The Drawings of Rodin (1971), about the profusion of drawings falsely attributed to Rodin. He married the artist Elyn Zimmerman, taught art history at Stanford for a year, then taught at Columbia University and at New York University Institute of Fine Arts. In 1987 he published a book about the French painter Gustave Caillebotte, which helped to initiate a revival of scholarly and public interest in that little-known Impressionist. A 1982 exhibition Varnedoe curated, ""Northern Light: Realism and Symbolism in Scandinavian Painting, 1880-1910"" introduced American audiences to yet more unfamiliar artists.

In 1984, the same year that he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, he co-curated with William Rubin, the principal curator and future director of the Museum of Modern Art, an important and controversial exhibition at MoMA, ""Primitivism in Twentieth-Cent"

using connectionstring from web.config instead of app.config

I have a class library project in which I've added a dataset which talks with sql server. The output of this project is to be consumed from a web application project. So I intend to put my connection string in the web application project.
Did a couple of things. In order to make my adapter use a different connection string, I had come across this. But I finally found doing the following convenient:
Dim adapter as New MyReqeustTableAdapter()
adapter.Connection.ConnectionString = sMyConnectionString

Then I tried taking the connection string from my configuration (app.config) to kind of simulate. I added a section manually with key ""myconstr"". My ideas was to do something like:
sMyConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionString(""myconstr"").ConnectionString

But my intellisense couldn't not detect ConfigurationManager. So had to add the appropriate reference to the project. 
Next I added a connection string via the settings designer for the web application project. I gave the above key for referencing it. However the above statment seems to throw a null reference exception.

A:

Suppose you have created a class library. In it you've defined a Settings property which goes like:

Myers developed the Century Radio brand for Border Radio Holdings in the early 1990s, launching two more stations later in the decade. He presented programmes under the pseudonym ""John Morgan"". He then became Chief executive of GMG Radio, developing the Real Radio, Smooth Radio and Rock Radio brands and overseeing GMG Radio's acquisition of the Century network from GCap Media. He served as Chief executive of The Radio Academy from April 2011 until June 2012 and the founding Chairman of TeamRock, retiring in May 2016.

In 2009, he was asked by the Labour Government to produce a report on the future of local radio in the UK (""The Myers Report"") which was published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in April 2009. A number of his recommendations were taken up by the Digital Economy Act 2010, leading to, amongst others, mergers within the Heart and Smooth Radio networks. Myers reviewed efficiencies at four BBC radio stations during the first quarter of 2011 and, in late 2011, began reviewing BBC Local Radio stations in response to the Delivering Quality First cuts.

Early career
Myers started his radio career in 1980 as a Station Assistant for BBC Radio Cumbria. He was the station's first country music presenter while also presenting and producing a number of music programmes. He became a presenter in 1982 for Red Rose and then, Radio Tees in 1984. In 1989 he became the programme controller and breakfast presenter for Red Rose Gold

While also in radio, he joined Border Television as a continuity announcer and programme presenter in 1985, and developed the long running Border Birthdays slot with a puppet called Eric the Monkey. He remained in television presentation for four years returning to Red Rose Radio in 1989. 
He became managing director of Border Radio Holdings in 1993, launching their independent local radio station, CFM. Myers presented the breakfast programme, the Friday night phone-in and a Sunday lunch-time programme, called 'fun on the phones'.

Century Radio
In September 1994, he launched Century Radio in North East England. He again presented the breakfast show, this time under the pseudonym of John Morgan. Myers later released a compilation cassette of the wind-ups from his show, and even a novelty single, called ""Three Rosettes"", under the further pseudonym of Mr Martin. He also co-presented other shows, such as the Sunday lunch time ""Fun on the Phones"".

During this time he also presented segments on Tyne Tees Television's magazine show. Ratings fell when Myers stepped down from presenting the breakfast show, and his replacement, Steve Coleman, was sacked after just three weeks.  Myers returned for another 12 months until Paul Gough replaced him in 1997.

In 1997 Myers left the North East to launch 106 Century FM in the East Midlands. A year later the BBC television fly on the wall documentary Trouble at the Top followed the launch of 105.4 Century FM in North West England.

GMG radio (1999–2008)
Myers moved to Guardian Media Group (GMG) after they announced they planning to enter the radio stations Market. Sir Robert Phillis, the former GMG chief executive, enlisted him to establish GMG's radio division after seeing Myers on the documentary programme Trouble at the Top.

Myers became managing director of GMG Radio in 1999, winning the first licence for GMG, Real Radio (Wales), which launched in 2000. Myers resurrected the ""Fun on the Phones"" presenting as John Morgan, with John Simons occasionally presenting. The breakfast show was presented by Terry Underhill and Sarah Graham in the first few years of the station.

He became chief executive of GMGR in 2002, and joined the board of directors of the Guardian Media Group in 2006. In October 2006, GMG Radio bought the two remaining Century stations from GCap, bringing Myers to control the brand he started in 1994. During his nine years with the company, it was awarded four licences and made the purchase of: Scot FM from the Wireless Group; JAZZ FM; Paisley's Q96 from UTV; the two Century FM stations from GCap; and four Saga Radio stations.

In March 2007 he oversaw the launch of the Smooth Radio brand, the UK's first mainstream commercial stations to target the 40- to 59-year-old adult. The five"

14th European PVMMPI Users' Group Meeting
Paris, France, September 30 - October 3, 2007
web: http://www.pvmmpi07.org
e-mail: chairs at pvmmpi07.org
organized by
Project Grand-Large (http://grand-large.lri.fr/index.php/Accueil)
from INRIA Futurs (http://www-futurs.inria.fr)
BACKGROUND AND TOPICS
PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) and MPI (Message Passing Interface)
have evolved into the standard interfaces for high-performance
parallel programming in the message-passing paradigm. EuroPVM/MPI is
the most prominent meeting dedicated to the latest developments of PVM
and MPI such as new support tools, implementation and
applications using these interfaces. The EuroPVM/MPI meeting
naturally encourages discussions of new message-passing and other
parallel and distributed programming paradigms beyond MPI and PVM.
The 14th European PVM/MPI Users' Group Meeting will be a forum for
users and developers of PVM, MPI, and other message-passing
programming environments. Through the presentation of contributed papers,
vendor presentations, poster presentations and invited talks, attendees
will have the opportunity to share ideas and experiences to contribute
to the improvement and furthering of message-passing and related
parallel programming paradigms.
Topics of interest for the meeting include, but are not limited to:
* PVM and MPI implementation issues and improvements
* Latest extensions to PVM and MPI
* PVM and MPI for high-performance computing, clusters
and grid environments
* New message-passing and hybrid parallel programming paradigms
* Interaction between message-passing software and hardware
* Fault tolerance in message-passing programs
* Performance evaluation of PVM and MPI applications
* Tools and environments for PVM and MPI
* Algorithms using the message-passing paradigm
* Applications in science and engineering based on message-passing
This year special emphasis will be put on large-scale issues, such as
those related to hardware and interconnect techologies, or the potential or
demonstrated shortcomings of PVM or MPI.
As in the preceding years, the special session 'ParSim' will focus on numerical
simulation for parallel engineering environments.
EuroPVM/MPI 2007 will also hold the new 'Outstanding Papers' session
introduced in 2006, where the best papers selected by the program committee
will be presented.

Click and Drag..
People who keep saying this game needs click and drag have probably not played it, in this game you move pieces diagonally I would love to see how these people could possibly move the pieces diagonally without touching the other tiles, I am sure the developer thought of this problem and its why its not in this game.
Anyway I liked the game, I have not seen another match3 game with so many options to change how you play, diaglonal movement, lightning, explosions, luck boosters.
Please give it a try and actually play it rather than missing it because of 'no slide no buy'..

Not your typical Match-3
This game is not your typical match 3 but I mean that in a good way, after playing a few levels and getting the diagonal power up, it became a different game almost, I was seeing ways to make matches that just werent possible before, the cheery music also helped and the colorful, but not kiddie graphics are a blast.
If you like your match3 games to have some actual strategy then this is for you.
Only downside is the storyline which does not matter (to me atleast)
A buy from me!
August 31, 2012

Lighthearted but fun
I liked the cheeryness of this game, the faces are funny and the matching pieces are easy to see (I mean easy to tell apart)
If you like your match-3 games over the top with some unique abilities, give it a try.
Just turn your sound down, the explosions really ARE explosions!

Don't take it on FACE value
The gameplay is your standard match-3 game, with plenty of different tiles to keep things interesting and diagonal movement if you buy the right spell.
The graphics are nice and the faces are fun, although I would like them to animate more, as they just seem to blink.
The music was fine, you can turn it off or down if you dont like it, but atleast it changes every now and then.
Overall I liked it, a new game not a sequel and some nice gameplay, Match 3 and a Memory Game, nothing really new but what is there is well done.
September 6, 2012

Pretty Unique
I like the magical power upgrades in this game, rather than the hammers and simple spells in other games like cradle of rome, it feels powerfull to use them, only bad thing was the music which I turned off.
December 9, 2012

Fast and Frantic
A fast and frantic match3 game, bright graphix and lots of spells.
The music was not to my taste, but thats why you can change the volume to OFF!
Loved it.
September 10, 2012

A Cheery Game
First of all it's good to see a new game rather than the constant stream of sequals, secondly it is good to see a game with bright colourful tiles that does not take itself too seriously!.
I have played around 12 levels already and I am loving the power ups, the spell effects are great and the exploding sound, while loud at first is very satisfying it has real punch.
I noticed some reviews saying you cant slide to match, true you cant, but soon you will have diagonal matching and I am not sure how sliding diagonally to match would work, easier to click surely?
September 1, 2012

A Good Change
I found this game a good change from the other more serious match-3 games, it was simple to play, happy looking and responsive, the power ups were a good extra too, overall I reccomend this game to anyone who likes match-3 games and wants a quick blast.

COVID-19 is demonstrating how policy decisions of social exclusion, reduced access to free healthcare, and increased inequality will now be felt by all of us. These policies are the enemy of our collective health.

As MSF scales up our response to the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, we will focus on the most vulnerable and neglected.

We started working in Hong Kong earlier this year in response to the first cases of COVID-19, and we now have medical teams deployed to respond in the heart of the pandemic in Italy. We will continue to scale up as much as is feasible as this crisis spreads.

However, there are decisions that can be taken now that will already ease the impending disaster that many communities may soon face. For example, the congested camps on the Greek islands need to be evacuated. That doesn’t mean sending people back to Syria where war still rages. It means finding a way to integrate people into communities where they will be able to practice safety measures such as social distancing and self-isolation.

In addition to this, supplies need to be shared across borders according to where the needs are the greatest. This needs to start with states in Europe sharing their supplies with Italy. It will soon need to extend to other regions that will be hit by this pandemic and whose ability to cope is already compromised.

As MSF, we will also need to manage the gaps we will face in staffing our other ongoing emergency projects. Our medical response to measles in DRC needs to continue. So too does our response to the emergency needs of the war-affected communities of Cameroon or the Central African Republic. These are just some of the communities we cannot afford to let down. For them, COVID-19 is yet another assault on their survival.

This pandemic is exposing our collective vulnerability. The powerlessness felt by many of us today, the cracks in our feeling of safety, the doubts about the future. These are all the fears and concerns felt by so many in society who have been excluded, neglected or even targeted by those in positions of power.

I hope COVID-19 not only teaches us to wash our hands, but makes governments understand that healthcare must be for all.

Challenges in supporting COVID-19 response

The COVID-19 pandemic has already spread to more than 100 countries around the world. These include countries whose health systems are fragile and where MSF teams have a long-standing presence, as well as regions such as Europe, where the capacities are more robust but where the epidemic is particularly virulent. Travel restrictions generated by the outbreak also directly affect MSF''s work around the world.

What questions does MSF face in this context? Clair Mills, MSF’s medical director, explains the challenges.

Are we right to be afraid of COVID-19?

Several factors make this virus particularly worrying. Being a new virus, there is no acquired immunity; as many as 35 candidate vaccines are currently in the study phase, but experts agree that no widely usable vaccine will be available for at least 12 to 18 months.

The case-fatality rate, which by definition is calculated only on the basis of identified patients and is therefore currently difficult to estimate accurately, appears to be around one per cent.

It is known that at least some of those people infected can transmit the disease before developing symptoms - or even in the absence of any symptoms. In addition, a very high proportion - around 80 per cent - of people develop very mild forms of the"

Farrell is a city in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,111 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History
Once dubbed ""The Magic City,"" Farrell sprung up practically overnight when a steel mill was constructed in 1901 on a plain bordering the Shenango River, near Sharon, Pennsylvania, in what was then part of Hickory Township (now Hermitage).

The community name was at the beginning South Sharon. In 1912, the population reached 10,000. At that time the residents of the new city elected to take the name of Farrell, after industrialist James A. Farrell.

The community was incorporated as the Borough of South Sharon in 1916; its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1920 and its status was elevated to a third-class city in 1932. In 1939, artist  Virginia Wood Riggs was commissioned to paint the mural Myths of Vulcan and Juno in the towns post office. The mural was painted over in 1966.

The mill, which eventually became known as the Roemer Works of Sharon Steel Corporation, would serve as the community's lifeblood until 1992, when it was liquidated after filing bankruptcy.  Many of the assets were sold at auction to Britain-based Caparo Corporation and later to Swiss steelmaker Duferco, which operates the plant today. Farrell was designated a financially distressed municipality in 1987 by the state of Pennsylvania.

Despite years of population and industrial decline, Farrell has made progress in rebuilding itself due to new industrial investments on tax abated land and several new housing starts.

Demographics

As of the census of 2000, there were 6,050 people, 2,504 households, and 1,620 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,589.1 people per square mile (998.3/km2).  There were 2,752 housing units at an average density of 1,177.7 per square mile (454.1/km2). The racial composition of the city was 50.28% White, 46.71% African American, 0.12% Native American, 0.20% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.30% from other races, and 2.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.66% of the population.

There were 2,504 households, out of which 27.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.0% were married couples living together, 24.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.3% were non-families. 31.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.37 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the city the population was spread out, with 25.6% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 18 to 24, 23.6% from 25 to 44, 20.8% from 45 to 64, and 22.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 80.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 74.2 males.

A wireless communication network may be deployed to provide various types of services (e.g., voice, data, multimedia services, etc.) to users within a coverage area of the network. In some implementations, one or more access points (e.g., corresponding to different cells) provide wireless connectivity for access terminals (e.g., cell phones) that are operating within the coverage of the access point(s).
In some networks, low-power access points (e.g., femto cells) are deployed to supplement conventional network access points (e.g., macro access points). For example, a low-power access point installed in a user's home or in an enterprise environment (e.g., commercial buildings) may provide voice and high speed data service for access terminals supporting cellular radio communication (e.g., CDMA, WCDMA, UMTS, LTE, etc.). In general, these low-power access points provide more robust coverage and higher throughput for access terminals in the vicinity of the low-power access points.
Various types of low-power access points may be employed in a given network. For example, low-power access points may be implemented as or referred to as small cells, femto cells, femto access points, femto nodes, home NodeBs (HNBs), home eNodeBs (HeNBs), access point base stations, pico cells, pico nodes, or micro cells.

As a steamfitter for the Wisconsin Electric Power Company in Milwaukee, Robert Hass' job was to install and repair the steam pipes that heat city buildings. Unibestos, a product made from asbestos, was used to insulate the pipes.

Hass died in 2011 from mesothelioma, a painful cancer that starts in the lining of the lungs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asbestos is a known carcinogen and considered the primary cause of a number of diseases, including mesothelioma.

Pittsburgh Corning, manufacturer of Unibestos, filed for bankruptcy in 2000 to establish a personal injury trust to compensate victims of asbestos exposure. More than 100,000 asbestos claims have been filed against the company. The trust is still pending in bankruptcy court in Pennsylvania, however, so no claims can yet be filed.

Hass' wife filed suit in early 2012 over the death of her husband, and the couple's children have since taken up the case. But if Assembly Bill 19, known as the ""asbestos bill,"" is approved by the Wisconsin Legislature, the case could be suspended indefinitely.

The only thing I’ve done previously is dice and roast beets with other root vegetables. So I was not sure just how easy this task was going to be. Everything turned out better than expected.



Pickled Beets

8lbs Beets

1 Bag Pearl Onions

1/2 White Onion

2 Cinnamon Sticks

12 Cloves

12 Allspice Berries

4 Cups Vinegar

2 Cups Water

2 Cups Sugar

1 1/2 t Salt

If your beets come with the greens attached just trim them above the bulb. The idea is to trim them, but not to cut in to the beet.

Cover the beets in water and bring to a boil.



Boil the beets for approximately 45 minutes. Mine were the size of baseballs, and 45 minutes was perfect.

While the beets are boiling heat a medium pan of water to boil. Then drop in your pearl onions and boil for 3 minutes. Place the onions in an ice bath to cool.



Remove the onions one at a time and cut off the root end. Then squeeze the flower end and the onion pops right out. If part of the center of the onion pops out just push it back in.



Repeat until all your onions are liberated.



When your beets are cooked drain them and place them in an ice bath. Be careful when removing them. The skin of the beets sloughs off very easily now and it’s a bit like trying to grab a wet bar of soap. The next step involves a slippery beet and a sharp knife so be careful. Cut off the root end and the leaf end.



Then remove the skin. This is seriously so easy. Way easier than peaches. And even easier than tomatoes. I just passed the beet back and forth in my hands working it in circles. Almost like a pitcher does with a baseball.



To make it even easier I did it under running water. This washed the peels away and also prevented my hands from looking like I spent the day with Ed Gein. Now tomato skins come off easily. But I’m always afraid of damaging the tomato. The beets however are hard and solid which made this part so easy.



Cut your beet however you like. I"

Cameroon is currently scaling up its malaria control program through LLINs with ongoing free distribution of nets to households. It is crucial that information on the susceptibility of malaria vectors to the major public health insecticides and the underlying mechanisms of resistance are properly investigated. This will adequately inform control programs of the most suitable insecticides to use and facilitate the design of appropriate resistance management strategies.

In this study, we report the resistance status of *An*. *funestus* population from northern Cameroon to several insecticides used in public health and also explore the underlying molecular basis of the resistance.

Study site {#sec006}
----------

Adult Mosquitoes were collected from the locality of Gounougou (9° 03′ 00″N, 13°43′59″ E) in northern Cameroon. The area is surrounded by the Benoué River with a major hydroelectric dam supplying electricity to the region and also providing water to irrigate about 15,000 hectares of crops downstream. In some areas, the river is surrounded by vegetation. In addition, the presence of a large rice field makes the area suitable for the development of the major malaria vector *An*. *funestus* by providing permanent breeding sites. The area is also characterised by the presence of cotton fields with indiscriminate use of insecticides by local farmers including pyrethroids and DDT \[[@pone.0163261.ref026]\].

Rosewood Scrub Historical Society Building is a heritage-listed former shire hall at 73 Edmond Street, Marburg, City of Ipswich, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1913 by Anton Jendrachowski. It is also known as Rosewood Shire Council Branch Office, Rosewood Shire Council Office, and Walloon Shire Council Office & Meeting Hall. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.

History 
This small timber building was erected in mid-1913 as offices and meeting place for the Walloon Shire Council.

Although the town of Walloon (on the Ipswich-Granchester railway line) was established in the 1860s, Marburg, established in the late 1870s in the centre of the Rosewood Scrub district, proved the natural administrative centre for local government. The Walloon Divisional Board, proclaimed in 1879, initially met at the Plains paddock, then at Woodlands (TL Smith's Marburg residence), and then at premises in Marburg. In 1903 the Walloon Divisional Board became the Walloon Shire Council.

Friedrich Wilhelm Karl Ludwig Weber (2 April 1846 – 29 January 1922) was a German Protestant pastor and social reformer. He was a pastor in Mönchengladbach. He was one of the founders of the Evangelical Social Congress and was chairman of the Association of Protestant workers' associations in Germany.

Life

Ludwig Weber was born in Schwelm in Westphalia on 2 April 1846, son of the magistrate Carl Weber and his wife Emilie. He grew up in Marienwerder, West Prussia. In 1863 Weber began to study theology in Bonn, Berlin and Erlangen, graduating in 1868. In Erlangen he was taught strictly orthodox Lutheranism.

He worked in Iserlohn and Dellwig in the Ruhr, then in 1881 was appointed to the newly created third pastorate in Mönchengladbach, where the congregation was growing rapidly due to the expanding textile industry. Weber was soon recognized as an outstanding preacher. He served as pastor at Mönchengladbach until his retirement in 1914.

Ludwig Weber died on 29 January 1922 in Bonn, aged 75. A street in Mönchengladbach is named in his honor.

Social reformer
As early as 1878 Weber was in contact with the Berlin court preacher and social reformer Adolf Stoecker (1835–1909). Weber identified the problems caused by social dislocation, growing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, and vulnerability of industry to fluctuating world markets. He concluded that Christianity could help alleviate the problems if it emphasized love rather than repentance. He was influenced by the ideas of Victor Aimé Huber (1800–69), who had argued for cooperative self-help and profit-sharing by workers. 
Weber undertook many initiatives to improve the living conditions of workers, and supported full freedom of association and the right of workers to organize. He was critical of the rigid attitude of the Protestant church on social issues.

Abolitionism
The first effective chapter of the International Abolitionist Federation (IAF) in Germany was organized in 1880 in Berlin, led by Gertrude Guillaume-Schack. It sought to abolish state regulation of prostitution. Liberal Protestant activists in Germany were in close contact with the IAF, and Ludwig Weber was on the IAF executive commission until 1887. However, the conservative Protestants had difficulty with the dominant liberal view that an individual had the right to do whatever they wanted with their body as long as they did not harm or affect the rights of others. The liberals thought the state should defend the rights of citizens but should not impose any particular religious or moral values, while the conservatives thought ""the state is the guardian of God's commandments."" Conservatives were also unable to accept the outspoken role that women played in the IAF, feeling it was for men to take the initiative.

Protestant workers' clubs
The first Protestant workers' club was formed in 1882 in Gelsenkirchen. Weber proved to be a strong supporter of these clubs and an effective organizer. For his social work, the leaders of the Evangelical Church held Weber up as an example to all pastors in 1890. At this time there were 50,000 members in the Protestant clubs.

From 1898 Weber headed the Association of Protestant workers' associations in Germany.  He used this position to influence social policy and legislation, mainly concentrating on workplace safety and housing. The number of members of the Protestant associations was relatively low compared to other unions, by 1914 consisting of 1,105 workers' associations with about 140,000 members. Over a third were in Rhineland-Westphalia.

Evangelical Social Congress
In 1890 Kaiser Wilhelm II dismissed Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and proclaimed that the state would be sympathetic to the demands of workers. The Anti-Socialist Laws were repealed at the start of what proved to be only a brief period of openness. Weber and Stoecker founded the Evangelical Social Congress in 1890 with the goal, ""to investigate social conditions in our nation, to measure them against the ethical and religious demands of the Gospel, and to make these demands more fruitful and effective in today's economic life."" This ambitious program drew opposition from Lutheran theologians, following Adolf von Harnack in his view that Protestants ""must adhere to the rule of Luther that the spiritual and the worldly are not to be mixed, and therefore that an economic program may not be proposed in the name of religion."" Conservative agrarians and industrialists also opposed and weakened the Social Congress.

In 1895 Wilhelm II dropped his policy of worker conciliation. A campaign by members of the Congress in 1895–96 was directed at a number of pastors and professors who were accused of being too close to the Social Democrats. Stoecker resigned. Weber also left the congress"

We all know what Bitcoin is and, if you have been around long enough, you probably also know how to store, trade or send it.

But since the technology is still quite new, have you ever wondered of the different ways you can use Bitcoin in your day to day life?

After all, each day more businesses announce their support towards Bitcoin.

From buying a plane ticket and paying for your train ride, to acquiring Amazon cards or the latest tech gadgets – let’s take a closer look at the practical usability of Bitcoin in your daily life:

Flights and hotels

Bitcoin is being used to book flights and hotels as early as 2013. Of course, with the progress of technology and popularity, more vendors now accept the digital coin for your dream holidays. Popular vendors include Expedia, Air Baltic, Cheap Air, and others.

If you have more Bitcoins than the average investor and you feel like splurging yourself, you can even go as far as paying for space travel, although this will set you back around $250.000, or about 47 BTC at the time of writing.

Exchanging for other currencies

While many people buy Bitcoin to hold on to it, others exchange it regularly in an attempt to make a quick profit, or simply to use other currencies instead. For this, you can use Paybis.

Paybis allows you to Sell Bitcoin with the following methods:

Bank transfers

You can exchange your Bitcoin for USD or EUR, and receive it directly in your bank account. By doing so you can use your funds for a more broad range of services.

Digital wallets

You can sell your Bitcoin and receive funds in your digital wallet(s). Paybis currently supports:

Perfect Money

Payeer

Advanced Cash

Skrill

As well as Neteller

The best part is that transactions take less than 5 minutes to complete.

Pay for music, applications, and movies

Bitcoin can also be used for entertainment and functionality. As Microsoft currently accepts BTC in its app stores, you can download everything from music to apps, to your favorite movie and pay for it with your digital coins.

Pay for services

Every day, more and more service providers start accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. It’s borderless nature and privacy, make for a great alternative to normal, fiat currencies.

From a legal representative to a relaxing massage, more and more companies are welcoming the new era of digital payments, allowing customers to pay with Bitcoin for their services.

Buy a beer, coffee or pizza

For Bitcoin enthusiasts that want to enjoy the small pleasures of life, a number of different pubs, cafes, and restaurants are willing to spoil you in exchange for Bitcoin.

117,8,14161,"Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) is a general term that includes a variety of chronic lung disorders. When a person has ILD, the lung is affected in three ways. First, the lung tissue is damaged in some known or unknown way. Second, the walls of the air sacs in the lung become inflamed. Finally, scarring (or fibrosis) begins in the interstitium (or tissue between the air sacs), and the lung becomes stiff.
Breathlessness during exercise can be one of the first symptoms of these diseases. A dry cough also may be present. These are common symptoms that many people ignore. Someone with these symptoms may wait until they feel quite ill before going to the doctor. People with different types of ILD may have the same kind of symptoms but their symptoms may vary in severity. Their chest X-rays may look alike. Further testing is usually recommended to identify the specific type of ILD a person has. Some ILDs have known causes and some (idiopathic) have unknown causes.
ILD is named after the interstitium because this is the tissue affected by fibrosis (scarring). ILD is sometimes also known as “interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.” The terms interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis are often used to describe the same condition and will be used interchangeably herein.
The course of these diseases is unpredictable. If they progress, the lung tissue thickens and becomes stiff. The work of breathing then becomes more difficult and demanding. Some of the diseases improve with medication if treated when inflammation occurs. Some people may need oxygen therapy as part of their treatment. The diseases may run a gradual course or a rapid course. People with ILD may notice variations in symptoms—from very mild to moderate to very severe. Their condition may remain the same for long periods of time or it may change quickly.
While the progress and symptoms of these diseases may vary from person to person, there is one common link between the many forms of ILD. They all begin with an inflammation. The inflammation may affect different parts of the lung, including the following: the walls of the bronchioles (bronchiolitis); the walls and air spaces of the alveoli (alveolitis); the small blood vessels (vasculitis"

121,5,13310,"Federal officials faced a dilemma in the years after the Civil War. The Comstock Lode and other Western mines were producing large quantities of silver, but the government could use only limited amounts of it in coinage. This seems puzzling in retrospect, for silver coins were few and far between in circulation (a lingering legacy of wartime hoarding), and Americans presumably would have welcomed major infusions of silver coins. But Mint officials feared that new silver coins would be subject to hoarding as well, since the marketplace was awash with paper money, including fractional currency born of wartime need. People would have been only too happy to exchange these notes, which brought less than full face value, for precious-metal coinage.



For a time, the miners found outlets for their silver, often in coinage form, in foreign markets. Canada, Latin America and Europe all absorbed significant quantities during the 1860s. But then, for various reasons these markets became glutted. In Europe, for example, Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck established a gold standard for Germany after unifying the country in 1871 and promptly dumped huge amounts of silver on the international market.



For the miners and their powerful allies in Washington these developments were doubly disturbing: Not only was it hard to sell their silver, but the market price was steadily declining. Initially, coinage did offer one escape valve: Under a long- standing law, silver could be deposited with the Mint for conversion into silver coins, for which it could then be exchanged. Having no other ready outlet, miners took advantage of this one. Invariably, they chose silver dollars, the one denomination that hadn’t been changed when silver coins were reduced in weight (and precious-metal content) in 1853. As a direct result, silver dollar mintages soared above one million in both 1871 and 1872.



But with the Coinage Act of 1873, Congress closed this loophole by suspending further production of silver dollars. And that’s where the Trade dollar came in: flexing their muscle, the mining interests won approval for this new silver coin—one that would, in theory at least, not only provide an outlet for the metal, but also open a whole new market for it in an area that was already receiving Congressional attention.



The market in question was Asia, particularly China. Some U.S. silver had found its way to that region previously, but now a full-fledged offensive was planned. The Chinese had shown a decided preference for silver coins, and up to then the bulk of American trade with China had been carried out with Spanish and Mexican dollars. The Trade dollar’s architects set out to supplant those rivals by"

When he came back with the words ""No Offence Series 3 press day"" I literally peppered my private bits with breath spray and in a menacing Viv tone uttered ""I'll sort it. Count me in sugar tits.""

For those not familiar with Paul Abbott's crime drama, I suggest quickly catching up on All4 but how to sum it up up a paragraph? It's a fast-paced, dramatic, funny, inappropriate, sweary crime drama led by the magnificent Detective Inspector Viv Deering. A woman who would happily waltz into Gene Hunt's kingdom and play Queen of the jungle. Written by the celebrated Paul Abbott (Shameless, Clocking Off) the dialogue is an electric mix of dark humour, unique insults and even, would you believe, some stuff about policing. In amongst all the madness, there is no desire to shy away from serious subject matters either. The first series focused on the murders of women with Down's Syndrome and the second had nods towards child trafficking. For the forthcoming series the show is not only about to get political but very current as it focuses on a far-right group.

Unluckily for me, my visit to the set coincides with the arrival of 'The Beast from the East' It was ruddy cold!. So, on an overcast winter's day in a far-flung corner of Rochdale at a temporary unit base might not be the most glamorous location but its a perfectly apt one because it felt so very No Offence. Luckily, most of the main cast are in attendance today and the first arrival is the marvellous Elaine Cassidy who plays DC Dinah Kowalska.

This morning Elaine is dressed in a flowery dress which we're assured is not a major tonal shift in her character's development and is indeed her own garb. Thank goodness for that, we don't want Dinah to be summery and cheerful! She is someone who on screen cuts an intense figure, always dressed in black and deeply ambitious about the job she loves. In the fifteen episodes so far she has certainly got herself into a few scrapes but her good heart is always what puts her there.

In keeping with previous series openers, the third instalment begins with big shocks. Run over by the bus? Bomb explosion in a crematorium? That's nothing compared what's in store this time round. ""It's a personal journey for everybody in Friday Street, as always the job means so much to all of them. They always want to get a result"" Elaine explains ""Dennis Caddy (???) is the head of a far-right group called Albion and they know he's involved at the beginning of the series. It's about trying to take down Albion but in doing that they find out it's not as straightforward as they initially thought. No case ever is. There are other people who are in the limelight in Manchester, who have influential jobs and it starts to get quite.. incestuous as to who is in whose pockets. There's a politician (played by Lisa Mcgrillis) who, when I was reading it I found quite an attractive character because she's really ambitious and she's come from nowt and its through her hard work and her tenacity that she wants to climb the ladder. She wants to get to the top and that is to become the Mayor of Manchester"".

William R. BENEDETTO
v.
TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY and Maryland Casualty Insurance Company.
No. 1686.
Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Fourth Circuit.
February 8, 1965.
Rehearing Denied March 8, 1965.
Emile J. Dreuil, Jr., New Orleans, for plaintiff-appellee.
Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere & Denegre, Ashton R. Hardy, New Orleans, for Travelers Ins. Co., defendant-appellant.
Sessions, Fishman, Rosenson & Snellings, James C. Murphy, Jr., New Orleans, for Maryland Casualty Co., defendant-appellant.
Before REGAN, YARRUT, and TURNER, JJ.
HENRY F. TURNER, Judge pro tem.
Plaintiff brought this suit against Maryland Casualty Insurance Company, the public liability insurer of Mrs. William Cullen, mother of the 13-year-old child, Julia Cullen, and The Travelers Insurance Company, public liability insurer of the Congregation of St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Roman Catholic Church, on behalf of his minor daughter, Cheryl Benedetto, primarily and incidentally on his own behalf for medical expenses to be incurred. The suit arises out of an accident that occurred on the premises of the St. Francis Cabrini School in New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 19, 1963, when a group of young girls, ranging in age from 11 to 13 years, were playing a game of softball during a morning 20-minute recess. Julia Cullen, daughter of Mrs. Cullen, insured by the defendant Maryland Casualty Company, was at bat and hit a pitched softball into right field, whereupon she disengaged herself *355 from the bat she was using, and the bat in some manner not fully explained struck Cheryl Benedetto, who was sitting along the third-base line eight or ten feet back from the base line, in the mouth, knocking one tooth completely out and breaking another one.
The plaintiff alleged negligence on the part of Julia Cullen by throwing or dropping the bat in the manner in which she did and negligence against St. Francis Cabrini School for permitting the softball game to be played in the area in which it was being played and also for improper supervision of the school children in its charge.
After hearing the evidence, the District Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff against both defendants, stating in its reasons for judgment that the school was negligent in permitting this softball game to be played in this particular area and, further, that the children were not given proper supervision. The District Court also concluded that Julia Cullen was negligent in her behavior.
We are unable to agree with our learned brother of the lower court in either conclusion. A careful review of the record in the case reveals that a few minutes after classes were dismissed for this 20-minute morning recess a group of young girls full of life and energy organized and began playing a softball game in an area between Prentiss Avenue and the Administration Building and a sidewalk that runs along Prentiss Avenue. Plaintiff's little daughter, 12 or 13 years of age at the time of the accident, was sitting along the third-base line some distance variously estimated at from 8 to 11 feet to the rear of a right-handed batter. The testimony is conflicting as to when she first sat there on this occasion. There is some evidence that Sister Louis Marie, one of the supervisors, shortly prior to the accident had spoken to some girls who were sitting at or in the same position as Cheryl Benedetto, and the girls had moved as a result of the Sister's having spoken to them. Whether Cheryl was one of the girls spoken to at that time or not we are not able to determine. Cheryl had previously sat on the sidewalk before to observe these games.
Counselor for plaintiff in brief stated that Julia Cullen flung the bat and it struck Cheryl Benedetto on the fly. The record does not support this. No one seems to know exactly how the bat was thrown or in what manner it struck Cheryl.
Baseball, being recognized as a national pastime, is well known to all, including 12-and 13-year-old children. In"

Kedar will leave his position at the authority at the end of July. Haaretz reported yesterday on an amendment to the Antiquities Authority Law, proposed by Culture and Sports Minister Limor Livnat, that would make it easier for her to find a replacement for Kedar. At present, the chairman of the Antiquities Authority board must belong to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Livnat's bill would require only that the chairman be a ""leading scholar in the field of history or archaeology.""

Senior archaeologists criticized Livnat on Sunday, claiming that the purpose of the amendment was to enable her to appoint archaeologists who are identified with the right or who will toe the establishment line. Livnat's critics say the bill reflects the anti-intellectual winds blowing through the government ministries. Kedar rejects this interpretation, but cautions against amending the law.

Prof B.Z. Kedar. I will tell my successor this is a very difficult, but satisfying job.Moti Milrod

What do you think of Livnat's proposed amendment?

""I was surprised by the proposed changes."" It is no coincidence that the law stipulates that the chairman of the board be a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and that the minister should make the appointment after consultations. The aim is to place at the head of the Israel Antiquities Authority a senior person in a professional field. It is also based on the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities Law which expressly states: 'The objective of the academy is to gather members who are among the most distinguished scientists, residents of Israel... to advise the government on matters requiring science planning.' The goal was to appoint as chairman of the Antiquities Authority someone deemed one of Israel's outstanding scientists.

The first proposal when the Antiquities Authority was established was to have the president of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities serve as chairman of the Antiquities Authority, that is to appoint the most senior of the senior scientists. That is why this proposal to expand the circle of potential candidates in effect damages the perception of the scientific and national standing of the Antiquities Authority.

127,17,2701,"My earliest memory of Star Wars is from the late 90s when my Dad got the new Special Edition boxed set for Christmas. It was 20 years after the original Star Wars film was released in 1977, and George Lucas had decided to celebrate by Frankensteining a bunch of (at the time) modern CGI into the films. To quote Douglas Adams, “This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.” Making changes 20 years later is a tough sell for any film, but for a film like Star Wars that was famous for its special effect techniques, the new visuals felt like they were from a different universe. The old and new never really gelled. Unsurprisingly, kicking off a new trilogy just a couple of years later stuffed with digital effects felt like another attack on the films that people fell in love with in the first place. The Phantom Menace was has remained a favored punching bag for the fandom ever since.

I’ve always had a complicated relationship with the prequels as a whole. I was young enough when The Phantom Menace came out that I didn’t have a critical bone in my body. It wasn’t just a movie either, the staying power of Star Wars has been its ability and willingness to flood the market with licensing deals. Darth Maul’s face was plastered on every consumer product imaginable, half of our toys were somehow associated with Star Wars, and I made it about 15 books deep into a series about Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan that was set before Episode I. Prequel Star Wars was the air that I breathed, but somewhere around the release of Attack of the Clones it started to sour. There were so many cringey lines of dialogue, and it was becoming clear that Lucas had no idea how to write young Darth Vader as a compelling character. (At the time I just blamed Hayden Christensen for being terrible, but I don’t think he was entirely at fault.) The whole thing was understood to be a train wreck and none of us could look away. Star Wars became a punchline, and The Phantom Menace became shorthand for everything that was wrong with the series. Yet I find myself in the strange position, 20 years after The Phantom Menace first graced the screen, of regarding it with incredible fondness. If you hate it I don’t feel a strong need to argue you out of that opinion, but I do think some of the most common criticisms are misplaced.

The most frequent gripe about the film seems to be the use of computerized effects, a criticism the new Disney films nimbly try to avoid by stuffing every behind-the-scenes photo with as many physical props as possible. It’s not a complaint that’s ever carried much weight for me though. Remember, I didn’t start watching Star Wars until after Han stopped shooting first. I still, to this day, have not seen the original films in their unaltered analog glory. I’ve just seen the comparison clips of a windowless cloud city and a barren looking sarlacc pit. Most of my experiences with Star Wars have included weird computer graphics, at least in the prequels the special effects stay fairly consistent. And in 1999, it made sense to embrace the latest technology available. Star Wars was a revelation in the 70s and 80s precisely because it pushed the envelope visually. While the digital additions to the original trilogy feel jarring and unnecessary, I don’t think embracing new technology was the wrong decision for The Phantom Menace.

Even now, it’s only the small details in the effects work that I really find distracting: the flat-looking plains of Naboo or cityscapes that seem too simple. Big set-pieces like the pod race are still thrilling, and I’m pleasantly surprised at how satisfying it still is to watch digital battle droids get carved up like butter. Even Jar Jar feels like less of an egregious error than he did then. In a world where Gollum, Dobby, and Groot are household names, it’s hard to remember a time when a digital character with a weird voice was such a novelty. He deserves much of the ridicule that he has received — the weird speech pattern is annoying and he has WAY too much screen time — but the impulse to create a digital character wasn’t a complete miscal"
128,2,26874,"Daryll Rowe infected five male sexual partners with HIV, and tried unsuccessfully to infect a further five. Yesterday, he was convicted in the Crown Court at Lewes on ten counts of causing, and attempting to cause, grievous bodily harm. He will be sentenced in January.

This is the first case in the UK in which a person has been convicted of intentionally harming, or attempting to harm, others with HIV – prior to this, all UK convictions have been for reckless transmission. It is a uniquely harrowing and distressing case, and the impact of Rowe’s actions on the complainants cannot be underestimated.

Unsurprisingly, the trial has provoked much media comment, and his behaviour widespread condemnation – the details of Rowe’s actions, after all, are particularly shocking.

But whatever judgement we might pass on Rowe’s behaviour from a moral or ethical perspective, the criminalisation of HIV transmission and exposure more generally raises a number of important questions, not least regarding its impact on HIV-related stigma and efforts to reduce, and ultimately eradicate, the virus.

Ever since its discovery as the causative agent of AIDS in 1983, countries across the world have used the criminal law, both to censure those who have exposed others to the risk of infection or have in fact infected others, to control the spread of the virus.

The first of these rationales, a retributive one, reflected the fact that, until the mid-1990s, HIV was untreatable and almost inevitably led to death. It is therefore not surprising that states should have treated HIV as a weapon, and its effects as serious bodily harm.

The second rationale, a deterrent one, assumes that punishment will deter the accused – and others – from engaging in risky activity. It therefore has a supposed legitimacy from a public health perspective.

Both of these justifications are problematic.

The false path

Regarding retribution, criminal law requires that the defendant manifest a high degree of fault at the time – typically, that he acted intentionally, as Rowe did, or recklessly. As to intention, this can be established in English law and many other jurisdictions if (a) it is proven that it was the defendant’s purpose to infect, or (b) it may (but need not) be inferred if infection was virtually certain to occur, and the defendant foresaw that consequence as virtually certain.

Proving purposive intention is extremely difficult – a deliberate intention to engage in sexual activity which carries with it the risk of onward transmission is not the same as intending to transmit. It is also very difficult, in the case of HIV, to establish intention in the alternative way because, as has been confirmed in a number of clinical consensus statements, from Canada, Australia, and Sweden, the probability of transmission in any one incident of sexual intercourse is extremely low.

What’s more, where a deliberate (but unsuccessful) attempt to transmit HIV during sex is prosecuted, is it legitimate to punish someone for failing to achieve a consequence which is, statistically speaking, extremely unlikely to materialise? Critically, in the case of HIV, the accused is unable, as a matter of fact, to exercise agency over the outcome. (There is arguably a difference between swinging a bat at someone’s knee and missing, and having sex during which a virus may, but on any one occasion probably won’t, infect a partner.)

Recklessness (the conscious taking of an unjustifiable risk), however, is a lesser form of culpability. It is easier to prove, and a far more common basis for criminalisation. Until now, reckless transmission has been the basis for all UK convictions.

Rowe was found guilty of intentionally harming, or attempting to harm, others with HIV. But criminalising reckless transmission is particularly problematic. From a retributive perspective, this amounts to punishing people living with HIV who have sex during which HIV is transmitted, not because they had any desire that this should happen but because they were aware that it might. This places the entire burden of minimising the risk on them (even in cases where a partner is in fact aware of the risks), and is even more problematic where reckless exposure (as opposed to transmission) is criminalised.

This is not just because no physical harm has been caused, but because there is an absence of clarity as to what degree of risk is acceptable. In Canada, for example, there needs to be a “significant risk”, though what this means is contentious. It is now widely accepted that when a person diagnosed with HIV is on effective treatment and has an undetectable viral load, transmission is all but impossible. In the words of a current, high-profile, campaign to encourage testing and treatment, Undetectable = Untransmittable, or U=U"

play 1:21 'My game plan is to get off strike' - Ronchi New Zealand wicketkeeper batsman Luke Ronchi is unsure about his role in the team before the first Test against India in Kanpur

In the second innings of their warm-up match against Mumbai, Luke Ronchi and Martin Guptill combined to give the New Zealand team management a selection headache sooner than they would have anticipated. While Guptill followed his first-innings failure with a duck, Ronchi scored a blistering century on a last-day pitch that had begun to misbehave.

It would be a dramatic move if a batsman who has opened only three times in first-class cricket replaced an opener in whom New Zealand have invested, but if there ever was a time and a place to do so, this might be it. Guptill averages 29.59 in Tests, which drops to 20.68 in Asia. He may be sensational in limited-overs cricket, but Tests and spin have not been his best friends. Concurrently, there is no better place than Asia for a non-opener to think about converting. It is often the best time to bat, before the ball begins to turn, reverse swing or gets too soft to travel.

Ronchi got his crack at a top-order spot in the second innings, much like his previous three forays playing for Western Australia before he moved to New Zealand. Mumbai declared immediately after Siddhesh Lad's century - the third of their innings. Then, out walked Ronchi alongside Guptill, the only specialist"

The distance from the mesio-incisal angle of the right incisor to that of the left incisor at the time of spring removal was measured by an expert orthodontist using Boley digital gauge (Digital caliper, Mitutoyo, Aurora, USA). Then the premaxilla was dissected, placed in fixative solution for 10 days (FineFix, Milestone, Fatebenefratelli, Italy) and then in %10 nitric acid for two days. Transverse sections with 3--5μ thickness were made using a microtome (RM 2135, Leica, Nussloch, Germany) at the coronal level of alveolar bone. The best section in each sample was stained with hematoxylin-eosin.

Number of resorption lacunae in a standard field (1 × 2 mm) at the distal aspect of the incisor root (pressure side) was counted by an expert pathologist using light microscopy at ×100 magnification. Histological sections were re-measured one week later. Bland-Altman plot was applied to assess the reproducibility, and no significant differences were found between the first and second measurements. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normal distribution of data, and homogeneity of variance was evaluated using Levene's test. T-test was also used for data analysis.

Android altbeacon ranging in intervals when app in background

I'm working on an app that runs a background service to range bluetooth beacons in intervals.
I start a ForegroundService with a timer to start ranging beacons for 10 seconds every minute, with an interval of 200 millis, calculates the strongest beacon and submits it to the backend API.
This works neatly while the app is in foreground, and, when the screen is off, as long as i'm hooked up using adb logcat. As soon as I take it off, nothing gets submitted to the servers anymore, meaning that no beacons are being ranged anymore.
Here are the relevant code pieces, I hope I didn't simplify too much:
class BeaconService : Service(), BeaconConsumer {
    private var beaconManager: BeaconManager? = null
    private var rangingTimer = Timer(""rangingTimer"", true)
    private val region = Region(""com.beacon.test"", Identifier.parse(""f7826da6-4fa2-4e98-8024-bc5b71e0893e""), null, null)

        return Service.START_STICKY

    override fun onCreate() {
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
            val notificationManager = MyNotificationManager.getInstance()
            val notification = notificationManager.buildBeaconServiceNotification(this, ""iBeacon service"", null)
            startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification)
        }

        initBeaconManager()
    }

    private fun initBeaconManager() {
        BeaconManager.setDebug(true)
        beaconManager = BeaconManager.getInstanceForApplication(this)
        beaconManager?.foregroundScanPeriod = 200L
        beaconManager?.beaconParsers?.add(BeaconParser().setBeaconLayout(""m:2-3=0215,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24""))
        beaconManager?.bind(this)
    }

In other words, hit a ground-ball single. That’s an atypical approach in the launch-angle era, but it’s basically who Duran is. While his physical stare suggests that he could pack more of a punch, he’s largely satisfied to slash and burn. Dubbed by some a poor man’s Jacoby Ellsbury, Duran — a.303/.367/.408 hitter last year — may or may not be Boston’s centerfielder of the future. He enters the season tenth on our Red Sox Top Prospects list.

John Means heads into the 2020 season a veritable lock to front the Orioles’ starting rotation. The 26-year-old left-hander is coming off a rookie campaign that saw him log a team-best 3.60 ERA over 155 innings. Moreover, Means managed to finish with more wins [12] that losses [11], no small feat when you toed the rubber for a 54-108 cellar dweller.

His performance qualified as a pleasant surprise. At this time last year, the former West Virginia Mountaineer was at best a borderline candidate to contribute meaningfully to the team that drafted him 331st overall in 2014. Humble to fault, he’ll be the first to admit it.

“Honestly, when I went to spring training I was on the very bottom of the totem pole as far as 40-man goes,” Means told me on the final weekend of his breakout campaign. “I wasn’t exactly their prime attention. I’ve really been a prospect.”

In terms of rankings, that’s an accurate assessment. Means was nowhere to be found on our 2019 Orioles Top Prospects list, nor was he ranked by Baseball America. A year earlier he’d been ho-hum in the minors, and his lone MLB appearance qualified as a clunker.

That was before he changed his offseason program, and received career-changing advice from Chris Holt, whom the Orioles had hired away from the Astros as their new minor league pitching coordinator.

Prior to last season, Means worked with Brian DeLunas and Josh Kesel at P3 St. Louis, “doing weighted-ball stuff, and kind of that whole new-era sort of deal.” The result was increased velocity, which when paired with a markedly-improved change-of-pace, metamorphosed Means into a successful big-leaguer.

“Coming up through the organization, we had a pitching coordinator that told me to throw my changeup like my fastball,” Means explained. “So I did. I got behind the pitch, and it was straight and hard. When I got to spring training, Holt told me, ‘No. Pronate it. You don’t have to make it look exactly like your fastball. You can get inside the ball.’”

Means did that, and suddenly his changeup was 4-5 mph slower. Mixing and matching it with a heater that was now 2-3 mph swifter, he was no longer a fringy, 4-A type of hurler. He had the ability to tie high-level hitters into knots.

Had he not trained at P3, and received words of wisdom from Holt?

“I wouldn’t be here,” said Means. “I could always pitch, but having that combination as a weapon makes a big difference. The separation makes a big difference. I have a lot of hop on my heater, a lot of vertical, and going from 88-89 to 91-92 makes my changeup a lot more effective.”

Means has other weapons as well. He augments his four"
134,11,26729,"Archibald Logan

Archibald Arch Logan (28 November 1865 – 27 March 1940) was a New Zealand sailing yacht designer who was a leading figure in New Zealand yachting from approximately 1895 until his death. The Arch Logan Memorial Trophy named in his honour is the premier trophy of the New Zealand M class centreboard racing dinghy sailing completions.

Early life

Archibald Logan was born on 28 November 1865 at Greenock, Renfrewshire, Scotland, the third of eight children of Robert Logan and Margaret McLay.  Robert, who was a boat builder, and his family emigrated to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland on the Zealandia on 15 October 1874.

In 1878 Robert set up in business as a boat builder in Devonport. 
After attending school at Devonport Archibald Logan, together with four of his five brothers, was employed in his father's business.

Logan brothers

In approximately 1890 Archibald and his brother Robert set up in business as R. & A. Logan on land reclaimed for the freezing works on the city side of Waitemata Harbour. In 1892 they were joined by their brother John, and the firm became known as Logan Brothers. Their business became very successful, and from 1898 they began exporting yachts to Australia, South Africa and the Pacific region. Their keel yachts were especially sought after but they also built a large number of centreboard craft, pleasure launches and commercial craft.
By 1900 Archibald Logan was not only the principal designer for Logan Brothers, but also the pre-eminent yacht designer in the southern hemisphere.

Among his designs during this period were:
Gloriana (1892), a keel cutter which was the first project by the firm of Logan Brothers.
Moana (Launched 14 November 1895).
Thelma (1897), a keel cutter which was Logan Brother's first large yacht.
The prototype for the Patiki unballasted centreboard sailing dinghy. This was commissioned in 1898 by the newly formed Parnell Sailing Club.
Kotiri (1897), a keel cutter built for Percy Dufaur.
Rainbow (1898), a keel cutter built for A.T. Pittar.
Iorangi (1901), a keel sloop built for A. H. Turnbull of Wellington. 
Erica (1903), a 25 ft stemhead sloop built for E.H. Webster.
Ilex. (1903). This cutter after being renamed Tu'uakitau and then Tuaikaepau she was lost in dramatic circumstances in 1962.  
Ariki (1904), a keel cutter built for Charles Horton, which dominated Auckland yacht racing for the next 35 years.
Rawhiti (1905), a keel cutter built for A.T. Pittar of Sydney.
Frances (1906), a keel cutter built for Robert Shakespear.
Mona (1908,) a 26 ft mullet boat built for F. Rickers.
Celox (1908,) a 26 ft mullet boat built for Tom Percy. 
Rawene (1908), a keel cutter built for Alfred Gifford. This was the last large yacht built by the Logan Brothers.
Ngaira (1909), a 22 ft mullet boat built for A & C Oxenham.
Venus (1909), a 22 ft mullet boat built for Robert Rae.

Establishes his own business

In 1910 Logan Brothers closed their business after accepting compensation from the Auckland Harbour Board for the surrender of their long lease on the Auckland waterfront so that construction of King's Wharf and the King's Wharf Power Station could proceed.

Archibald Logan, who was then living in Stanley Point Road, Devonport, with a boatshed on Ngataringa Bay continued to build boats, but at a slower pace and increasingly began concentrating on the design side. 
He designed and built the champion shallow-drafted mullet boats, and after the First World War designed many keel yachts, centreboard craft (in particular the 18-foot Patiki M class) and power craft. By 1930 Logan was mostly occupied in yacht designing.

Among his designs during this period were:
Ngaio (1921), a motor launch. One of her owners in the 1960s was Sir Keith Park.
Valeria (1913), a 22 ft mullet boat built by Logan for A. Nelson.
Omatere (1913), a 26 ft mullet boat designed and built by Logan for the Ox"

Non-contiguous array as filter criteria for xlfiltervalues

Common problem, I have worked through all answers I've found and finally got it almost working.

How to Find a Social Security Number of a Dead Relative from Legal Beagle

On her blog The Legal Genealogist, Judy G. Russell wrote about Ordering the SS-5 (posted on May 31, 2013).

...the SSA has made it harder to get the very information most useful
from the SS-5 forms: the date and place of birth and the names of the
parents. Here’s what the SSA says now: “under our current policy, we
do not release the parents’ names on an SS-5 application unless the
parents’ are proven deceased, have a birth date more than 120 years
ago, or the number holder on the SS-5 is at least 100 years of age.”

She also says:

In a large number of cases, people who have ordered SS-5 forms since
2011 have found the copies they receive have had the names of the
parents redacted (blacked out) and even on occasion the date and place
of birth as well. To avoid that, you need to provide evidence that the
parents are deceased, or that they would have been born more than 120
years ago, unless the person whose SS-5 you’re ordering was born more
than 100 years ago. And, again, there’s no way to attach that proof in
the online system.

She recommends sending in the printed SSA-711 form with supporting evidence to avoid getting redacted records.  The end of her post also has recommendations for information you can send in if you need to appeal.

In November of 2016, the US National Archives added to its Access to Archival Databases (AAD) website a related group of records from the Social Security Administration, the NUMIDENT files.  A PDF on the content and scope of these digital records can be downloaded here: Freqently Asked Questions: Series: Numerical Identification (NUMIDENT) Files, 1936 – 2007 Record Group 47. Section II.4 of this document addresses the differences between the data in the SSDI and this database.

A:

The Social Security Death Index is commonly used for information about birth and death dates, state of SSN issuance and state of death.  This information can be quite useful in its own right and is an easily accessible post-1940 source of nationwide information, unlike the Census, which is lagged by decades for privacy reasons.
But it's just an index to a treasure trove of information.  Many people who do genealogy are unaware that there is any information beyond the index, but it can be a very valuable tool for researching 20th century relatives.  Beyond the basic vital stats of the index, you can request the Social Security Application Form SS-5 of the person in the index.  The Form SS-5 provides more detailed information about the person being search:

Full name
Full name at birth, including maiden name
Present mailing address

ps: Clean way to only get parent processes?

I use ps ef and ps rf a lot.
Here is a sample output for ps rf:
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
 3476 pts/0    S      0:00 su...
 3477 pts/0    S      0:02  \_ bash
 8062 pts/0    T      1:16      \_ emacs -nw...
15733 pts/0    R+     0:00      \_ ps xf
15237?        S      0:00 uwsgi...
15293?        S      0:00  \_ uwsgi...
15294?        S      0:00  \_ uwsgi...

And today I needed to retrieve only the master process of uwsgi in a script (so I want only 15237 but not 15293 nor 15294).
As of today, I tried some ps rf | grep -v'\\_ '... but I would like a cleaner way.
I also came accross another solution from unix.com's forums:
ps xf | sed '1d' | while read pid tty stat time command ; do [ -n ""$(echo $command | egrep '^uwsgi')"" ] && echo $pid ; done

But still a lot of pipes and ugly tricks.
Is there really no ps option or cleaner tricks (maybe using awk) to accomplish that?

A:

After discussing with @netcoder on his answer's comments he used a nice trick :D
Using f on ps will always get the parent on top which is great.
This should just work:
$ ps hf -opid -C <process> | awk '{ print $1; exit }'

as I mention on the comments, this will return the pid of just one process. 

I would go with:
ps rf -opid,cmd -C <process-name> | awk '$2!~ /^[|\\]/ { print $1 }'

that is:

list running processses r (or e if you want everything)
along with parent/children graph f
output only the pid and command name -opid,cmd 
only for the given process -C <process>

and then

if the 2nd field - which is the command (-opid,cmd) - does not start with a \ or | then it is a parent process, so print the 1st field - which is the pid.

simple test:
$ ps f -opid,cmd -Cchromium
  PID CMD

Dear osu! community,



In light of the recent events, we thought it'd be necessary to clarify a few things among the numerous misunderstandings.

For those who are unaware of what this is about, we are refering to the Vaxei vs. Chocomint match that happened last Sunday.

VOD here (courtesy of CPOL): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--YUCLZipN4&



1. Brief summary



Last Sunday morning was held one of the semifinals match of Game Osu, opposing Chocomint and Vaxei, two of the favorites of this tournament. It has come to us after the match started that Chocomint was injured, yet decided to end the match without forfeiting due to seemingly being pressured by our forfeit policy (more on that later).

The match was then followed by Reddit and Twitter threads where some of the most important figures of the community accused us of forcing and threatening Cookiezi to play in order to maximize our Twitch audience, despite him being injured.

This whole situation ended up with a huge backlash from the community on Twitter, Reddit and our Discord server.



Original Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/dqvxgw/vaxei_vs_chocomint_gameosu_round_5/



2. Reschedule/Forfeits policy



As opposed to what might have been poorly said, players always had the right to reschedule/forfeit in exceptional cases like this, we do care about players' health and we are not apathetic, we are looking to make the tournament as sane for players as possible.

We have always been flexible with our (re)schedulings as a match is better than no match when it's justified enough (i.e players not being home, personal issues or in this case, hand injuries), even going against our policy. (see: https://gameosu.s-ul.eu/doHAXdeK)

Even though there were no forfeit policy on the website, we do follow common-sense for it, we believe a player should always be able to leave the tournament whenever he wants and for whatever reasons.



3. Regarding cash prizes removal in case of forfeits



Original Statement: https://gameosu.s-ul.eu/LEZWw1Hf



Due to a wave of forfeit among players and because of the upcoming pressure from having to stream enough matches for our sponsors, we decided (Friday night) that we would mention the possible removal of any cash-prize earned by forfeiting the tournament.

Unfortunately due to a communication mistake on our end, we omitted exceptions in the announcement, with the most important being about cases like injuries or important personal issues. Quite obviously we would never invalidate someone's achievements for unfair reasons.

We apologize for making this statement this late in the event, and overlooking its consequences. We will do our best to avoid confusion in the future.



As for why we decided to create such a rule, we can't allow ourselves the risk to lose, for example, a Grand Finals match because a player decided to forfeit without justifying himself. This is a common rule in sponsored tournaments (ie. ESL) to prevent abusive forfeits.

Because of our engagement with the sponsors, having less matches due to forfeits would make our sponsors reconsider their investments in the future, and this is obviously not conceivable for us as we think this is a positive outcome for the game going forward.



Do note that this forfeit rule applied for full forfeits of the tournament, not just single matches forfeit. A player in Winner bracket"

I've also been avoiding reading any Tokyo Ghoul fanfics purely out of fear that it's all going to be super angsty. I'm gonna check it out now that I've thrown this under the spotlight, but I'm still anxious about it. Still, I've enjoy what I've read of RWBY fanfiction so this should at least be comforting.

Now, as this is a first story, I'm not expecting much. It's been in my head for a while lately but I'm not sure how others will react. Then again, the main point of this account was to practice writing in general.

RWBY is owned by RoosterTeeth Production and was created by the late Monty Oum (Rest In Peace)

The Tokyo Ghoul Manga was written by Sui Ishida and published by Shueisha and Viz Media

There were a lot of Grimm.

Emerald found the sheer amount of Grimm mildly disturbing. It didn't help that they were all Beowolves, and that there was literally one other person who was apparently homeless, unarmed an insane.

""Sorera wa nanidesu ka?""

So she may have decided to sneak out without telling Cinder. But why should she need to? She hadn't hurt her, or anyone else. Cinder hadn't specifically said not to. And Mercury went out as well! What he went out to do she didn't really want imagine. Whatever it was, a walk in the forest would be much more wholesome. Why there were Grimm in the forest, she had no clue. There had been no earlier sightings, and considering the close proximity to the city, any pack should have been destroyed by hunters stationed long before they got this close. Yet a pack as large as this got through somehow.

6
This Court has consistently held that an appeal of the denial of postconviction relief will not be permitted to go forward where it is clear that the appellant could not prevail.... Criminal Procedure Rule 37.2(c) provides in pertinent part that a petition under the rule is untimely if not filed within ninety days of the date judgment was entered if the convicted defendant did not appeal from the judgment. As stated, appellant did not appeal from the judgment and he did not file his petition under Rule 37 until approximately twenty-one months after the judgment was entered. Time limitations imposed in Criminal Procedure Rule 37 are jurisdictional in nature, and a circuit court cannot grant relief on an untimely petition.

The Court's opinion noted that a motion to proceed with a belated appeal had been filed and denied. The Court's holding that the Rule 37 petition was untimely is plainly based on the proposition that an unsuccessful attempt to pursue a belated appeal has no effect on the state-law time limit contained in Ark.

Chicago, IL - On January 10, Nicolás Maduro was inaugurated to his second term as president of a nation under siege. The United States and its puppets in the region (the 13 governments of the so-called Lima Group, led by Colombia and Brazil) have declared that they will not recognize Maduro as the head of the Venezuelan state. This is in contempt of the 67% of Venezuelans that voted for him in the May presidential election, widely recognized as free and fair by the international community.





When Maduro took the reins of the national government, many analysts did not believe he had what it took to hold the Bolivarian project together. He proved them wrong. After five years with Maduro at the helm, the Bolivarian Revolution has - in the face of economic suffocation, fascist street violence, political terrorism, threats of invasion, and the attempted assassination of their president - emerged stronger than ever before.

Flight of the Hopeless

In view of Tunisia's persistent economic crisis and high jobless rate, also in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution, many young Tunisians are tempted to turn their backs on their homeland and seek their fortunes in Europe. This gives greater weight to projects aimed at improving prospects for the younger generation and persuading them to abandon plans to cross the Mediterranean. By Beat Stauffer

﻿Nabil Ben Abdesselem runs a small grocery shop in a suburb of Zarzis. The 30-year-old man with the friendly face and the full beard has a very special story: He's one of the ""harraga"", the young men who, following the flight of Ben Ali and the subsequent confusion, seized the opportunity to venture out into the big wide world: to Lampedusa, Sicily, Milan and Paris.

Nabil lodged with his brother for a few weeks. But then he realized how difficult life is in France for migrants from the Maghreb. And not just for them: Once even an unemployed European begged him for money.

When Nabil heard about a programme for returnees, he registered at the French Office of Immigration and Integration. He received 3,000 Euros, an air ticket to Tunisia and a guarantee of financial assistance should he realise a project back home.

And this is exactly what he has done. In an outlying district of the southern Tunisian town of Zarzis, not far from the Libyan border, Nabil was able to rent a garage and quickly turn it into a small grocery store. He was supported in his endeavours by the ""Association of Sustainable Development and International Cooperation"" (ADDCI), a local NGO that's existed for some 10 years.

""For me, this is a project for life""

Setting out for new frontiers: After returning from Europe, Nabil Ben Abdesselem set up a small grocery store and is now largely able to earn his own living

​​The little shop now has a loyal customer base, enabling Nabil to earn his own living to a great extent. ""For me, this is a project for life,"" says the young man who, after leaving school without any qualifications, took on casual jobs in different sectors for almost 10 years without ever finding a permanent position. Nabil would be only too happy to pass on what he has learned from his tough experiences to the young men who hang around the cafés of Zarzis dreaming of a better life in Europe.

It would be very important to inform these young men of the risks of clandestine migration and also about the difficulties that await them in Europe should they succeed in making the dangerous journey across the sea. This is not just the view of politicians in Europe, who fear a further surge in the number of economic migrants from the south.

In Zarzis too, an increasing number of people think something urgent must now be done. The capsizing of a refugee boat off the coast of Lampedusa, an accident in which some 70 people lost their lives, has alarmed the Tunisian public and at the same time provided indisputable evidence this clandestine emigration continues almost unabated.

But it also became clear once again to what extent even official authorities are turning a blind eye when it comes to illegal migration to Europe. In a programme broadcast on Tunisian television, one of the 56 ""harraga"" rescued off the coast of Lampedusa said that the head of the Sfax coastguard had even wished them a pleasant journey.

The flourishing illegal migration business

This is probably no isolated case: In Zarzis too, several eyewitnesses confirm that official authorities are well aware of the clandestine emigration and often even receive money in exchange for looking the other way. The highly lucrative trafficking network continues to flourish – and everyone knows who's pulling the strings.

Gloomy prospects for young people in Zarzis: In view of high youth unemployment many view illegal migration over the Mediterranean as the only chance to make something of themselves

​​So it's hardly surprising that in practice, few steps are being taken to stem the flow of migrants and that barely any preventative work is being carried out. Granted, some time ago the ADCCI produced a film highlighting the"

155,21,18598,"Last night’s episode of The Leftovers — the season’s penultimate — was particularly insane, even by Damon Lindeloff standards. While we learned approximately nothing about Kevin’s fate post-Patty battle, we did get a terrifying glimpse into the mind and coke habits of Meg, as well as an explanation about Evie’s disappearance. As usual, though, the episode brought up more questions than it did answers. Here are a few of the loose ends that Lindeloff’s forced us to contend with for another week:

1. Why did Evie join the GR?

Did anybody else scream audibly at the sight of Evie in the back of that trailer? Just me, then? Anyway, we finally know where our girl’s been these past few episodes — she wasn’t kidnapped (at least not technically, though she may have been brainwashed), she didn’t Depart, and she sure as hell isn’t dead. Somehow, the Guilty Remnant got their hands on Evie and her pals and convinced them to fake their own disappearance, likely to destroy the people of Jarden’s permeating sense of safety. But it’s unclear just how the GR pulled Evie and Co. into their ranks. We know Meg and Evie met back when Meg first visited Jarden in search of answers about her mother — the two shared a bag of baby carrots, a sense of ennui about the town (“I’m sorry you didn’t find whatever you were looking for here. Nobody ever does,” said Evie), and a cheesy knock-knock joke about a pencil (the same one Evie told her father earlier in the season). Did Meg go back to find Evie after joining the GR? Did they both come upon the cult separately? Did Meg dream up the plan to have Evie pseudo-Depart? What’s the long game here? And why are they spreading bad knock-knock jokes?

Here’s a hint: In an interview with Variety this morning, Lindeloff suggested that Evie might have joined the chain-smoking cult because she’s a particularly disillusioned teen. “We were having all those conversations very, very early on and we decided the girls were really angry about [Jarden’s] exceptionalism. They sing the Miracle anthem but they sing it snidely and snarkily and with some degree of teenage rebellion. We’re like, ‘Yeah, they faked it.’ And obviously this is a horrible thing to do — it goes well beyond a teenage prank, to put your parents through this.” (He also provides plenty of thoughts about keeping mysteries alive in today’s media environment, the danger of revealing answers too soon, and, strangely, Picnic At Hanging Rock, which he cites as an inspiration for this particular plotline.)

2. What’s with all the secrets?

In last week’s Lynchian dream-isode, the mysterious man on the bridge in Jarden whispered a lengthy sentence into Kevin’s ear before Kevin carried little Patty to the well. When Patty innocently asked what the man had said to Kevin, Kevin replied, “It’s private.” Similarly, this week, after some serious prodding, Isaac the psychic-slash-palm-reader told Meg what her mother’s last words to her would have been. In both cases, the audience was left without a single clue as to what the hell was going on. Which is typical for The Leftovers, and typically frustrating. What"

Ok so they are displayed different, but they can't be the same because NHibernate cannot handle it. The C# version is handled perfectly fine by NHibernate, the VB version resolves in the following exception being thrown:

157,15,16216,"1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic signal focusing method for focusing a received ultrasonic signal reflected from an object, and more particularly, to an ultrasonic signal focusing method for controlling a focusing delay time of a received ultrasonic signal to obtain a maximum resolution for use in an ultrasonic imaging system.
2. Description of the Related Art
In general, an ultrasonic imaging system emits an ultrasonic signal to an object to be examined, receives the ultrasonic signal reflected and returning from the discontinuous plane in the object, and then converts the received ultrasonic signal into an electrical signal to output it to a predetermined imaging apparatus, to thereby show the internal sectional structure of the object. The ultrasonic imaging system is widely used in a medical diagnostic field, a non-destructive testing field, an underwater detection field, etc.
In the ultrasonic imaging system, one of crucial factors required for functional improvement is an ultrasonic image resolution. It is steadily under development to improve the resolution. To improve the resolution, it is general that a recent ultrasonic imaging system uses an array transducer and performs transmission and receipt focusing through an electrical signal processing. A focusing method for an ultrasonic signal will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.
FIG. 1 shows transmission and receipt of an ultrasonic signal using an array transducer. The array transducer including a plurality of transducer elements converts an electrical signal into an ultrasonic signal and emits it to a focal point on an object. Then, the ultrasonic signal is reflected from a plurality of discontinuous planes on the object, and the reflected signal is input to the array transducer. When a plurality of discontinuous boundary planes exist in an object, an ultrasonic signal in each boundary plane is reflected in sequence and then input to the array transducer. The ultrasonic signal input to the array transducer after being reflected from the object has a different arrival of time according to the location of each transducer element. As shown in FIG. 1, a transducer element #0 located in the center of the array transducer receives an ultrasonic signal travelling as far as a distance of S.sub.0 and being reflected from a focal point. However, since the n-th transducer element #n receives an ultrasonic signal travelling as far as a distance of S.sub.n (S.sub.n"

LIZ JONES WRITES - AND CHICKENS DIE

How is the Eye’s favourite columnist Liz Jones getting on in the country retreat she documented her move to so thoroughly back in December (see Hackwatch, Eye 1201)?

Well, she has adopted some chickens who had formerly been in a battery farm. In February this year she described the poor animals as “bald… covered in blood. Their beaks were misshapen. They were so weak they could barely stand, let alone walk or grasp a perch.”

The good news is that a mere nine months later, after tortuous negotiations and the involvement of the Press Complaints Commission, Jones’ paper the Mail on Sunday agreed to print a letter from the Battery Hen Welfare Trust which pointed out that “the ex-battery hens Liz Jones collected from us in January 2008 were generally in good condition, not ‘covered in blood’ nor ‘almost pecked to death’ as she wrote.” Founder Jane Howorth, who prides herself on her good relations with the farming industry and the fact her organisation will “never knowingly allow a hen to go to a new home with health problems,” pointed out that “her sensationalist article only illustrated how shock tactics and negative spin achieve nothing – it directly damaged farm relations resulting in the loss of thousands of Ex-Bats, hens we could have homed.”

159,16,14958," like whirlpools in a broader stream, so the broader stream itself is an impersonal form of consciousness that underlies all reality. Aldous Huxley ably called it'mind-at-large,' a term that I will adopt from this point on. Now, for the same reason that the experiences of another person appear to us as a seemingly objective image — namely, an active brain — the seemingly objective world around us is the image of conscious experiences in mind-at-large. Moreover, for exactly the same reason that feeling love is completely different than watching the brain activity of someone in love, the first-person experience of mind-at-large will feel completely different than your watching the world around you right now. The world is the image of conscious experiences in mind-at-large, but mind-at-large doesn't experience the world the way we do, for the same reason that our volunteer inside the brain scanner doesn't experience patterns of firing neurons! The volunteer experiences love, not firing neurons. When we look at the world around us, we do see the footprints of conscious experience, but not the gait. And this is why theology not only has a concrete and worthy subject of study and speculation, but perhaps the ultimate one. Allow me to elaborate.

George Berkeley used to say that empirical reality was an experience in the'mind of God,' his term for'mind-at-large.' The term, although admittedly old-fashioned and highly ambiguous, was and remains appropriate: if all reality consists of ripples (that is, inanimate objects and phenomena) and whirlpools (that is, living creatures) in the stream of mind-at-large, then the attributes 'omnipresent,' 'omniscient,' and 'omnipotent' apply to the stream for obvious reasons. Therefore, it is fair to say that all empirical reality is the image of ideas in the'mind of God.' We cannot know how the world is felt by 'God' simply by looking at the world, for the same reason that a neuroscientist cannot know what love feels like just by looking at brain scans. Yet, when we contemplate the magnificence and incomprehensible magnitude of the stars and galaxies through our telescopes, we are essentially looking at a'scan of God's brain.'

Thus, theology does have a very concrete subject: mind-at-large, or 'God.' And theology also has concrete data to make inferences about this subject: nature itself. After all, nature — from atoms to galaxy clusters — is an image of God's mental activity, just like a brain scan is an image of a person's subjective experiences. Theologians themselves have explained this in their own language, as a careful read of, for instance, Henry Corbin will reveal. If one denies the validity of nature as data for the study of 'God,' one must deny the validity of brain scans as neuroscience data. What theologians call 'Creation' is the'scan'— the image, symbol, metaphor, icon — of 'God's' ongoing, conscious, creative activity. ""All the world an icon,"" as Tom Cheetham summarized it. Goethe, in Faust, preferred the word'symbol' instead of 'icon.' He wrote: ""All that doth pass away / Is but a symbol."" What in nature doesn't pass away?

Coyne could counter this by saying that we already have the natural sciences for studying nature, and that the scientific method is much better suited for this purpose. This is as strictly correct as it misses the point: theology is an attempt to see past the mere images and make inferences about the subjective processes behind those images, which include emotions and intentionality; it is an attempt to see past the 'brain scan' and infer how it 'feels to feel' love in a direct way; it is an attempt to see past the footprints and understand where the hiker wants to go, as well as why he wants to go there. In this sense, theology and the natural sciences are entirely complementary.

And this isn't all. If we are whirlpools in the broader stream of mind-at-large, then the implication is clear: at bottom, our personal psyches are not only one with each other, but also one with mind-at-large. After all, there is nothing to a whirlpool but the stream itself. This way, we are merely alters of mind-at-large, in the exact same sense that people with Dissociative Identity Disorder also have multiple alters. It follows that the expression of the deepest, most obscure and obfuscated regions of the human psyche (which depth psychology has come to erroneously call the 'unconscious') may reveal something about the direct subjective perspective of mind-at-large itself. And here is the key point: people"

161,27,1150,"For those unfamiliar with the historic backdrop to the game, Wars of the Roses, was a series of civil wars fought for the English throne between the houses Lancaster and York between 1455 and 1485 (thanks, Wikipedia). The game, War of the Roses, will see players pick either Lancaster (red) or York (white), and do battle for their king.

Each player customises the look of their character from a wide selection of helmets with dozens of attachments and gear, while the 15 different types of weapons also offers a lot of variation - everything from lances, swords, maces, halberds, to poleaxes and bows.

This is an ad:

Armour comes in three variations; light armour for quick movement, medium plate mail with cloth pieces, and heavy full plate armour that will slow your acceleration down considerably. Each player carries three weapons to the battlefield, your main two-handed weapon, a secondary weapon and finally a dagger as last resort.

""But the dagger is just as deadly as any other weapon,"" lead designer Mårten Stormdal adds as he describes the philosophy behind the weapons in the game. ""All weapons should be just as deadly if handled correctly.""

The combat system lets players swing left, right, overhead or thrust their weapons forward. Hold the mouse button down for a moment and you'll perform a more powerful swing. Additionally there are four different parries to correspond to the different swings. During the tutorial/campaign you will see indicators to help you parry correctly, but in multiplayer you're going to have to learn the various animations instead. Add in horses and cowardly archers, and you get some kind of idea of how the battles may look.

""Nobody has done it with this amount of depth"", says producer Gordon van Dyke.

The system for perks, things that improve your proficiency with a weapon, or allow you better movement with an armour type or things of that nature, sports a total of 60. There are five categories and you can specialise in two of these as you rank up, however you will be able to pick and switch as much as you like, creating millions of possible perk combinations. Learning how to spot what a player is good at is going to be very important in War of the Roses.

The packet is next routed over the y-axis until the packet reaches the destination node.
In heterogeneous mesh topology in which one or more routers or one or more links are absent, dimension order routing may not be feasible between certain source and destination nodes, and alternative paths may have to be taken. The alternative paths may not be shortest or minimum turn.
Source routing and routing using tables are other routing options used in NoC. Adaptive routing can dynamically change the path taken between two points on the network based on the state of the network. This form of routing may be complex to analyze and implement.
A NoC interconnect may contain multiple physical networks. Over each physical network, there may exist multiple virtual networks, wherein different message types are transmitted over different virtual networks. In this case, at each physical link or channel, there are multiple virtual channels; each virtual channel may have dedicated buffers at both end points. In any given clock cycle, only one virtual channel can transmit data on the physical channel.
NoC interconnects may employ wormhole routing, wherein, a large message or packet is broken into small pieces known as flits (also referred to as flow control digits). The first flit is the header flit, which holds information about this packet's route and key message level info along with payload data and sets up the routing behavior for all subsequent flits associated with the message. Optionally, one or more body flits follows the head flit, containing the remaining payload of data. The final flit is the tail flit, which in addition to containing the last payload also performs some bookkeeping to close the connection for the message. In wormhole flow control, virtual channels are often implemented.

168,0,17354,"The 2016 conversation has ignored disabled people. Now, they want to be heard.

Disabled advocates plan to make their voices heard during the 2016 election cycle.

It’s a safe bet that certain hot-button issues will be addressed in the next round of Democratic and Republican presidential debates this week: unemployment, health care, gun control, the economy.

But will the candidates talk about how the unemployment rate among the disabled is more than double that of non-disabled Americans?Or that people with disabilities are far more likely to be victims of violent crime? Will there be any mention of the many disabled people whose struggles are compounded by poverty and inadequate health care?

Probably not, say disability rights advocates — so they aim to change that. As the candidates take the stage, and a vast audience follows along on social media, disabled voters plan to make their voices heard by rallying under the Twitter hashtag #CripTheVote.

The campaign’s co-creators, disability rights advocates Gregg Beratan, Andrew Pulrang and Alice Wong, say the effort is nonpartisan; the goal isn’t to endorse any particular candidate, but to encourage them all to listen to the country’s largest and most diverse minority population.

“So many campaign moments have passed, and really no one was bringing disability issues into the discussion in a way that meant something to the disability community,” Beratan said. “We need them to start taking us very seriously as a voting bloc.”

Disability issues have surfaced in the election cycle from time to time, he said, but not always in a constructive or accurate context. Some Republicans have raised the scientifically disproven “link” between vaccinations and autism (much to the alarm of medical experts). Various candidates have voiced support for disabled veterans — often without elaborating much on what that support actually means. And then there was Donald Trump’s widely publicized mockery of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a congenital muscular disorder that restricts movement in his joints.

It hasn’t exactly been the sort of attention that the disability community is looking for, Beratan said.

So the trio decided to create an online space for disabled voters who want to share their thoughts and perspectives about key political issues. The activists worked with national disability-focused organizations and nonprofits to spread the word about the first two #CripTheVote Twitter chats, which will be held during the hour preceding the Democratic debate on Thursday and the Republican debate on Saturday.

There’s no set agenda, and all perspectives are welcome, said Wong, who is also the founder of the Disability Visibility Project.

“We’re going to ask people with disabilities what issues matter to them most and encourage them to identify and highlight them,” she said. “Many issues that are a priority to all voters, such as the economy, gun control, mental health, employment, healthcare, and Social Security, are of interest to people with disabilities as well.”

But those issues affect disabled people differently, she added, and that nuance is often lost. So the organizers hope the Twitter chat will also help educate not just the candidates and their campaign staffs, but also other voters and the public at large.

“There are still a lot of people who think of disability as a purely physical thing — a person in a wheelchair,” Pulrang said, adding that this inevitably excludes the many people who struggle with"

One of the questions that has received little attention to date is how to estimate and quantify drought-induced death of tree biomass across large, heterogeneous landscapes. Such estimates are needed, for example, to assess the significance of drought as a disturbance type for national-scale reporting of forest carbon sources and sinks (e.g., [@b31]), as well as for projecting future impacts of climate change on forest ecosystem functioning and on the supply of forest products ([@b23]). A major barrier to the reliable estimation of large-scale impacts is that drought often leads to tree death patterns that are patchy across a range of spatial scales ([@b4]). Such patchiness was especially evident in previous studies of aspen dieback and mortality in western Canada, where it was found that the magnitude and distribution of biomass losses across the region could not be reliably assessed solely by extrapolation from the CIPHA plot network ([@b26]).

To overcome these challenges, we conducted aerial surveys, made ground measurements at a supplementary network of temporary plots, and conducted spatial analyses of databases on land cover and meteorological records. The objectives of this paper were (a) to characterize the extent and severity of aspen dieback and mortality across a 11.5 Mha survey area ([Fig. 1](#fig01){ref-type=""fig""}) where the 2001--2002 drought was most intense ([@b26]); (b) to quantify the amount of dead aspen biomass within this survey area; and (c) to examine the relationship between drought severity and its impact on the percentage and total quantity of dead biomass in aspen stands across the affected area. The results are ultimately intended to provide knowledge for projecting future impacts of climate change on the region\'s aspen forests and for including drought as a disturbance type in Canada\'s National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting, and Reporting System ([@b31]).

Study area
----------

Spatial analyses for this study were conducted across an 11.5 Mha (115 000 km^2^) area of western Canada, bounded by latitudes 54.9--52.1°N and longitudes 113.7--104.4°W, where drought conditions were especially severe during 2001--2002 ([@b26]; [Figs 1](#fig01){ref-type=""fig""} and [2](#fig02){ref-type=""fig""}). This survey area included a 5.7 Mha (gross area) portion of the parkland and 5.8 Mha of the adjacent, climatically moister boreal forest; the boundary between these vegetation zones marks a regional, moisture-driven tipping point in ecosystem functioning ([@b27]; [@b23]). For this study, the boundary between the boreal forest and the parkland was derived from a Canadian ecological classification ([@b16]). The terrain in this area is generally flat to rolling (range of elevations 380--800 m). Mean annual temperature is 0--3 °C and mean July temperature is 15--"
176,7,5858," dollars"" (Plaintiffs' brief at 6). So long as the Resource Properties remain subject to the mortgage liens, however, the Railroad cannot benefit from the development or sale of the properties. That is because the mortgages do not provide for the withdrawal of excess collateral, or for the substitution of collateral. Further, in the event of sale of Resource Properties, the mortgages require the Railroad to deposit all the proceeds with the trustees, as collateral. Thus the Railroad would reap no benefit from the sale or development of the properties. Since the bonds are not callable before maturity, the bondholders can effectively block or ""hold up"" the Railroad from exploiting the Resource Properties until all the bonds mature in 2047.
Precisely because they have this ""hold up"" value, the bonds (which are traded over the counter on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)) have commanded prices far above their value as debt obligations alone. For instance, on April 19, 1985, the Prior Lien Bonds traded at 3 percent above their value as debt obligations, and the General Lien Bonds at 66 percent above such value (Batkin Aff. ¶¶ 7-8). Bondholders speculated that the Railroad would be so eager to release the land from the mortgage liens that it would some day offer to buy back the bonds at a premiumperhaps even above par (Railroad's brief at 24).
The Railroad wishes to have the Resource Properties released from the mortgage liens. It has attempted to accomplish this without buying back the bonds from the holders. Instead, on April 19, 1985, it entered into agreements with the trustees (the ""Letter Agreements"") whereby the trustees will release the Resource Properties from the mortgage liens on June 22, 1985, provided that certain conditions are met to protect the bondholders. The central condition is the so-called Deposit Plan, under which the Railroad will deposit in irrevocable trusts sufficient United States securities to satisfy fully all future financial obligations of the bonds as they become due. In essence, the government securities would substitute for the Resource Properties as collateral for the bonds and would guarantee timely payment of all bond obligations.
The Railroad has already purchased a portfolio of government securities for $63.4 million, containing bonds with varying maturity dates totaling $184.315 million in principal amount. This is sufficient to meet all outstanding bond obligations as they become due. For instance, the portfolio will yield $4,815,205 in 1986, when the Railroad's obligations under the bonds will not exceed $4,814,752. In 1997, the year in which the Prior"

W.R. Cooper General Contractor, Inc.  (Cooper) appeals the judgment of the United States Claims Court dismissing its complaint.   See W.R. Cooper Gen. Contractor, Inc. v. United States, 12 Cl.Ct. 406 (1987).  We vacate and remand.

BACKGROUND

2
Cooper was a subcontractor for Garcia-Allen Construction Company (Garcia-Allen), the prime contractor under a contract with the City of Miami Beach (the City), Florida.  The prime contract, known as the Washington Avenue Revitalization Project (the Project), involved federal funds.  Under the subcontract, Cooper installed a sprinkler system in 1981 and 1982 on the median strip of a roadway.


3
The Project, including subcontracts, was subject to the prevailing wage provisions of 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1440(g), 5310 (1982) and the overtime provision of 40 U.S.C. Sec. 328 (Supp. III 1985).  Due to a Department of Labor (DOL) investigation concluding that Cooper had violated the cited statutes, DOL requested in May and June of 1982 that the City withhold payments to Garcia-Allen in the amount Cooper was due for work performed, which the City did.


4
On June 17, 1982, the City placed the disputed funds in escrow.  On March 16, 1983, Garcia-Allen released any claim to the escrowed money, or alternatively, assigned its rights in the funds to the federal government.  Thereafter, on September 27, 1983, the City remitted these funds to DOL.


5
In seeking to recover the funds, Cooper initially brought suit against Garcia-Allen, the City, and the Secretary of Labor in a Florida state court.  The Secretary, however, removed the action to federal district court in Florida.  On the government's motion, that court dismissed the claim against the United States because it determined that jurisdiction for the claim rested exclusively in the Claims Court.  The court, moreover, remanded the remaining claims to state court.


6
On September 25, 1986, Cooper filed a complaint in the Claims Court.  On the government's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), however, the Claims Court held that there was no Tucker Act jurisdiction for Cooper's claim.   Cooper, 12 Cl.Ct. at 408-11.  Subsequently, Cooper appealed.

Super genius catcher

SAN DIEGO -- Dwight Lowery got an up-close look at super-talented wide receiver Julio Jones during his one year with the Atlanta Falcons in 2014.

Lowery, who now plays free safety for the San Diego Chargers, said Jones’ reputation as one of the best receivers in the business is deserved because of his humility and relentless work ethic.

“What puts him over the top is he’s like that every day,” Lowery said. “Every time he’s on the football field, he’s locked in and ready to go, and he competes.

“It’s one thing to have talent, but it’s another thing to have talent that actually works. And he’s a working talent, and I feel like that’s truly what separates him.”

The Chargers obviously will have their hands full when they hit the road and face Jones and the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. Atlanta is the top scoring offense in the league, averaging 33 points a contest.

Making matters worse, San Diego could be without three-fourths of the team’s projected starting secondary for a third game in a row on Sunday.

Top corner Jason Verrett is done for the year with an ACL left knee injury, while strong safety Jahleel Addae has missed four games with a broken clavicle, and cornerback Brandon Flowers has missed three games due to lingering concussion issues.

183,19,5200,"Improvements in microprocessor designs have led to microprocessors with a high operating frequency. Current microprocessor designs may exceed operating frequencies of 200 megahertz (MHz). However, the increase in operating frequency typically has not led to fully acceptable performance gains. One of the main components affecting performance gains is created by the microprocessor execution units idling during delays in external memory access. The delays in external memory access are caused by the conventional design characteristics of static random access memory (SRAM) cells, read only memory (ROM) cells, and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells.
To counteract the performance losses associated with external memory access, Rambus Inc., of Mountain View, Calif. developed a high speed multiplexed bus. FIG. 1 is a typical prior art system using the Rambus high speed bus. In particular, the system 1000 comprises a master device, or central processing unit (CPU ) 10, coupled to slave devices DRAM 20, SRAM 30, and ROM 40. Each device is coupled in parallel to signal lines comprising DATA BUS, ADDR BUS, CLOCK, VREF, GND, and VDD. The DATA BUS and ADDR BUS signal lines comprise the data and address lines, respectively, used by CPU 10 to access data from the slave devices. The CLOCK, VREF, GND, and VDD signal lines comprise the clock, voltage reference, ground, and power signals, respectively, shared between the multiple devices. Data is transferred by bus drivers (not shown) of each device driving signals onto the bus. The signals are transmitted across the bus to a destination device.
To increase the speed of external memory accesses, the system 1000 supports large data block transfers between the input/output (I/O) pins of CPU 10 and a slave device. The system 1000 also includes design requirements that constrain the length of the transmission bus, the pitch between the bus lines, and the capacitive loading on the bus lines. Using these design requirements the system 1000 operates at a higher data transfer rate than conventional systems. Accordingly, by increasing the data transfer rate, the system 100 reduces the idle time in CPU 10.
The system 1000, however,"

I remember vividly what was one of the darkest days of my life. I sat in the carport of our condo after dropping the girls off at school, with my baby in her carseat behind me. The blackness of despair in my soul was so heavy I could hardly breathe, let alone find the strength to get out of the car and take her upstairs. I gripped the steering wheel of my car and I cried out to God, begging Him to help me. I asked Him to send someone to take my baby girl and care for her the way she deserved to be cared for, and to lay me down in the bed and leave me there. I had not an ounce of hope in my soul, and the only thing that was keeping me alive was the fear that I had no one to take care of my baby. It was a dark and terrible day that I still look back upon with deep sadness. For a long time, I was ashamed of that moment as a mother, but today I have great compassion toward myself and any mother who has ever been in that place, because I landed there in brokenness, not in willful neglect. I wanted what was best for my daughter, but I was certain I was not that best, and I had no idea how to become better.

God did not speak to me that day. He didn’t send anyone, either. Eventually, I mustered the strength to take my baby upstairs and tend to her for yet another day. And the next day, I got out of bed and did the same. My days since then have been a repeat of the same track: get up and show up, asking God for the strength to love and to serve the ones He’s given to me. Somewhere in the middle of that"

The authors of [@VonAppen2015] and [@Riesen2017] focused their studies on single households, [@Venu2009] and [@Klaassen2015] looked at residential areas, and [@Nykamp2012] studied an entire village of prosumers with PV systems. [@Klaassen2015] specifically address the relationship between maximum power and PV size, which is not reported in most other studies. They derive values of annual maximum residual load (MRL) and annual maximum surplus generation (MSG) from net load duration curves of three residential areas equipped with different sizes PV generators. Similar approaches had been previously followed by [@Ueckerdt2013] and [@Schill2014], but for studying the effects of PV usage at a country-wide level.

This work aims at comprehensively estimating the impact of decentralized PV systems on transmission grid usage. A PV plant was chosen as a representative system for renewable power generators, because PV has been intensively studied [@Ogbomo2017; @Sato], and is widely implemented world-wide. Two model communities have been analyzed which have very different load and solar irradiation patterns. Two cases were studied for comparison, i.e. PV-only systems and PV systems combined with a battery storage. The marginal change in transmission flows related to the studied systems is not directly evaluated. Instead, the power exchange at the transformer connecting the model communities to the public grid is taken as a proxy for transmission requirements related to serving the community’s electricity demand.

The work builds on the concepts of MRL and MSG introduced by [@Klaassen2015], and uses them to form the newly proposed MPI-MPE diagrams, which plot the annual maximum power import (MPI, in MW) and annual maximum power export (MPE, in MW) that result from the introduction of a local PV system with or without an additional battery storage into the community’s local grid. This new instrument is a very insightful and yet simple visualization of the effect that different PV sizes have on the exchange of power at the community’s connection point to the public grid. Through this, transmission reductions from decentralized generation can be analyzed over a range of PV sizes in an intuitive manner. To the best knowledge of the authors, similar tools do not exist in the literature, so the proposed MPI-MPE curves extend the state-of-the-art of transmission reduction analysis for the domain studied here.

The Method

The power exchange of a community at a distribution transformer that connects it to the public power grid is analyzed here. The higher of the two values MPI and MPE as introduced before is taken as an indicator of how much the community"

The hyperbolic tangent is another commonly used squashing function having a range from -1.0 to +1.0: EQU y=tanh(net)
Many other squashing functions may be used. The choice does not seem to be critical as long as the function is nonlinear and bounds the neuron's output.
The output layer in FIG. 5 multiplies vector y by weight matrix W.sup.2 producing output vector ""out"". Hence, EQU out=f(xW.sup.1)W.sup.2
Since supervised training is used in backpropagation, a training set is required consisting of vector training pairs. Each training pair is composed of an input vector x and a target vector t. The target vector represents the set of values desired from the network when the input vector x is applied.
Before training, the network weights are initialized to small, random numbers. The optimal range of these numbers is problem dependent, however, it is safest to start with a range around.+-.0.1 While larger values can accelerate convergence on some problems, they can also lead to network paralysis.
The object of training is to adjust the weight matrices so that the network's actual output is more like the desired output. More formally, the algorithm minimizes an error measure between the output vector and target vector. This error measure is computed and the weight adjusted for each training pair. While many error measures are possible, in this case the error measure used is: ##EQU1## where i is the number of components in the output vector.
Alternatively, the error may be averaged over all vector pairs in the training set, in which case the error measure is: ##EQU2## where n is the number of training vectors in the training set.

From the equation of motion according to coordinate $x$ we get a close connection between the dynamical variable $B$ and the coordinate of the particle: $$m\ddot{x}\frac{d^2B}{dt^2}+m\dot{x}\frac{d^3B}{dt^3}=V'(x) \frac{d^2B}{dt^2}$$ with the equation (\[eq\_penergy\]) give: $$\frac{\dot{\ddot{B}}}{\ddot{B}}=\frac{2V'(x)}{\sqrt {2m(E(t)-V(x))}}-\frac{P}{2(E(t)-V(x))}$$

To get a feeling of these kind of theories, let us look at the case of a harmonic oscillator $ V(x)=\frac{1}{2} kx^2 $. First of all, we see from eq (5) and the condition that the right hand side be positive, since the left hand side obviously is positive, we get that there is a boundary time $\tau=-\frac{E_0}{P}$, that for $P>0$ we get $t>\tau$, and for $P<0$ there is a maximal time $t<\tau$. Let us consider the case the power P is positive. The equations of motion in that case will not oscillate, but will grow exponentially until the “Pt” term present in equation (\[eq\_penergy\]) dominates, when $\langle {x^2} \rangle \propto t$. This is very similar to a Brownian motion behavior.

The momentums for this toy model are: $$\label{eq:6a}
\pi_x=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{x}}=m\dot{x}\ddot{B}$$ $$\label{eq:6b}
\pi_B=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{B}}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\ddot{B}}=-\frac{d}{dt}E(t)$$ $$\label{eq:6c}
\Pi_B=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\ddot{B}}=E(t)$$ Using Hamiltonian formalism (with second order derivative [@hamilton1][@hamilton2]) we get that the hamiltonian of the system is: $$\label{ham}

192,18,26443,"Magic City: TV Review

The already-renewed Starz drama mixes ""Mad Men"" with ""The Sopranos,"" resulting in strong writing, stronger acting and a whole lot of distracting nudity.

At first glance, Magic City, a new Starz drama series, might lead a viewer to think someone has taken parts of Mad Men and parts of The Sopranos and dropped both into a mojito and left it on a lounge chair in the Miami Beach sun.

Well, something like that. Magic City looks good enough to drink, even if you're a little suspicious that you've had these ingredients before under a different name. It's also at times visually reminiscent of those series, even though it's trying to carve out a completely fresh angle.

Set in Miami Beach in 1959, Magic City centers on how one man, Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), builds the immaculate Miramar Playa Hotel on prime beachfront property and watches celebrities, politicians and mobsters gather to play. He is the king of his castle, but, as Magic City tries to underscore numerous times, it's a castle built on sand.

PHOTOS: 'Mad Men' Season 5 Premiere Red-Carpet Arrivals

The series, at least in the early going, seems content to show how much the Miramar means to Ike -- how the former cabana boy's dream needs to be protected at all costs. Although he seems like the luckiest man alive as a widower now married to the gorgeous Vera Evans (Olga Kurylenko), Ike sold 49 percent ownership to Ben ""The Butcher"" Diamond (Danny Huston) to get the hotel built. That was fine when Ben was living in Havana, but with Cuba about to fall to Castro, Ben has returned and wants more.

Plus, on New Year's Eve, with Frank Sinatra in the house for two sets, the Miramar is surrounded by pickets as organizers try to force Ike to unionize. The hotel is Ike's baby, and he doesn't want anyone -- union, Ben, politicians, police -- to tell him how to run it.

Although Magic City has the same era-specific mannered perfection as Mad Men, plus the mobster element of The Sopranos, the series is doing its own thing (Miami and the Cuban connection being a helpful delineation). If anything, Magic City is closest to Mad Men in that not a whole lot happens as series creator and writer Mitch Glazer tries to set up his complex worldview. Slow movement in and of itself should not be a problem (besides, Starz has allowed more nudity and sex in Magic City than in almost anything else, which ought to keep your attention). But there’s always a worry with slow-building series on niche cable channels that they will fall prey to fierce competition. Early on, there’s enough intrigue and style in Magic City to keep the viewer wanting more, but it’s not as fully realized from the get-go as shows like Mad Men, Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.

PHOTOS: Midseason TV Preview: 17 New Shows Premiering in 2012

That's no condemnation. Those series are the top-tier dramas on television. It's too early to say where Magic City will end up, but there's more than enough here to keep watching. The premise is intriguing, the hotel is magnificent, and there's something mature and compelling about Morgan. Glazer made him a little older than the usual leading man -- his first wife died of cancer, and he has two grown sons and a daughter. The good son is Danny (Christian Cooke), who wants to be a lawyer and keeps his nose clean, and the bad son is Stevie (Steven Strait), who’s bad only in the sense that he uses his good looks to bed pretty much anyone he sees -- in particular, Lily (Jessica Marais), wife of the Butcher. Meanwhile, Danny’s got his eye on Mercedes (Dominik Garcia-Lorido), a housekeeper at the Miramar.

Anyway, Ike’s age is a nice change from the usual. He’s been around; he has a history. And having the young Vera doting on him ("

India’s fascination with the space is centuries old, with astronomy and astrology being prominent parts of our history. With ISRO having launched a record 104 satellites into space at the same time this month, this age-old fascination has found a brand new impetus in the minds of Indians.

So how can Bollywood be too far behind in this latest craze? With the industry only seeing sporadic science-fiction movies, and nearly none based on the outer space, the Hindi film business is seeing not one, but three ‘out of the world’ movies set to go on the floors this year.

One of the most anticipated science-fiction movies, Chanda Mama Door Ke, is set to star hot property Sushant Singh Rajput in the lead role and the actor has reportedly started preparing for his role as an astronaut already. Having taken flight simulation lessons already, Sushant has spoken about being inspired by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s journey to the moon aboard Apollo 11. “I’d always wondered how Armstrong, Buzz & Michael were feeling during those 9 days to the Moon. Well, now I know,” he said.

The movie’s director, Sanjay Puran Singh says he’s glad science fiction movies are finding more takers, and that filmmakers are actually willing to put their money on them. “There was a time when Indian producers were not ready to back sci-fi movies. But now I’m glad that more filmmakers are exploring this genre and producers are ready to take that risk.

“With an increased level of certainty we can now say why couples become couples. We don’t know with certainty what keeps people together but we have a better idea about what gets them together,” he said.

Royal Evidence

The research astrologer reports that aspects involving the Sun and Venus have turned up regularly in progressed synastry charts for couples in Britain’s Royal Family. For example, Prince Charles and Diana came together when Charles’ progressed Venus was forming a trine to Diana’s progressed Sun. However, the relationship began to unravel once this aspect became exact and started to wane.

In contrast, for Royals William and Kate, a long-lived trine involving Kate’s progressed Venus and William’s natal Venus was forming when the couple met in 2000. Due to retrograde motion this aspect will not separate until 2030, at which time the couple will be able to rely upon other helpful aspects.

Westran notes that Wallis Simpson, an American, had already been married twice when she met Prince Edward Windsor in 1934. At the time a progressed Sun – Venus conjunction in the couple’s progressed synastry chart was exact.

The Prince became King Edward VIII in 1936 when his father, King George V, died. Wallis divorced her second husband Ernest in 1937 in order to marry Edward, but the House of Windsor created impenetrable roadblocks. Edward chose to abdicate the throne and marry Simpson. Although the couple was ostracized by the establishment they enjoyed a happy marriage in Paris until Edward’s death in 1972, Westran said, adding:

“Their story is most often seen as a triumph of love over duty. But, while grieving by his coffin, Wallis reportedly was overheard saying: he gave up so much for so little.”

Harry and Meghan also began their relationship under the same progressed Sun progressed Venus aspect when it was exact. These combinations “act like windows of opportunity for relationships to begin, but also tend to fade when the when the Sun and Venus move on,” Westran said.

“Like Wallis, Meghan is an American divorcee. Only in 2017 this, apparently, is no longer an issue for the British establishment. Indeed it might be seen as a major plus. In a world of inclusivity and merit the world expects its icons to show an example of realism and understanding of the problems faced by people everywhere.

“This is the case for human relationships, including marriages, as the world now understands that relationships don’t always work out, that people change and marriages fail. For all the promises made with authenticity and good intensions circumstances will prevail. What astrological connections give you is a little advantage.

“Astrology provides an exceptional tool to explore human consciousness. It’s exciting that we can use it to help understand why people change and the element of timing associated with it,” Westran said.

In addition to developing a software program to track progressed synastry aspects Westran created a unique graphing system to visually display when the progressed synastry aspects begin, become exact and separate – as shown below.

200,4,9852,"Since a transmissive scattered liquid crystal (also termed a polymer scattered liquid crystal) does not include a deflection plate, the transmittance thereof is high when it displays data. Thus, the transmissive scattered liquid crystal is very suitable for an application which requires a high transmittance. However, when a DC voltage is applied to a transmissive scattered liquid crystal, an electrolysis takes place, thereby reducing the life of the liquid crystal. Therefore, when the liquid crystal is driven, an AC voltage should be applied.
Known drive methods for transmissive scattered liquid crystal display devices include a static drive method and a multiplex drive method. In the static drive method, one end of an electrode of each pixel is connected to one common line so as to switch the other end thereof. In the multiplex drive method, which uses two or more common electrodes, each common electrode is selected and driven on a time division basis. FIG. 1 shows a conceptional schematic diagram of the static drive method. FIG. 2 shows a conceptional schematic diagram of the multiplex drive method.
FIG. 3 shows a circuit diagram of the static drive method for one pixel 1 of a liquid crystal display device. FIG. 4 shows a drive waveform diagram for the circuit of FIG. 3. An exclusive OR gate 2 is used as the drive circuit for the pixel 1 of the liquid crystal display device. When a square shaped AC voltage V.sub.c is applied to one electrode C of the pixel 1 of the liquid crystal display device and to one input of the exclusive OR gate 2 while an ON portion of the ON/OFF signal V.sub.sig is being applied to another input of the exclusive OR gate 2, an inverted voltage V.sub.8, wherein the plus and minus of the square shaped voltage V.sub.c is inverted by the exclusive OR gate 2, is applied to the other electrode S. Thus, a liquid crystal applying voltage (V.sub.c -V.sub.s) is applied between the electrodes C and S of the pixel 1, and thereby data appears on the pixel. In contrast, when the ON/OFF signal V.sub.sig is turned off, the voltage applied to the pixel 1 of the liquid crystal display device becomes zero, and thereby the data on pixel 1 disappears. While a single common electrode can be connected to each pixel, this circuit configuration requires a number of exclusive OR gates 2 corresponding to the number of pixels in order to be able to apply a control signal to each pixel of the liquid crystal display device.
Although the multiplex drive method requires a plurality of common electrodes, it can drive the liquid crystal display device with a lesser number of data electrodes (i.e., number of all pixels/number of common electrodes) than that of the static drive method. Thus, the multiplex drive method is suitable for driving a liquid crystal display device with a large area and a large number of pixels. However, when the liquid crystal display device is driven in the multiplex drive method, an AC voltage should be applied as in the static drive method in order to avoid reducing the life of the liquid crystal display device. Thus, the plus and minus of a drive voltage for the liquid crystal according to the multiplex drive method should be changed as shown in FIG. 5.
FIG. 6 shows a method for applying voltages to pixels of a liquid crystal with first and second common electrodes C.sub.1"
201,7,8702," below the arc hole reticulum layer. Tissue necrosis in the thermally desiccated layer occurs as a result of the current heating effects of the electrical energy dissipating from the arcs. The desiccation layer is also uneven in depth and location due to the nonuniform application of the arcing energy over the arc hole reticulum layer. Significant variations in the depths of the desiccation layer are also typical.
Over a given area of tissue, certain locations are only moderately affected by the arcing energy. A thin arc hole reticulum and a thin desiccation layer result. Other areas have a relatively thick eschar formed therein. Very thick carbonized eschars tend to be fragile and are prone to crack when flexed, usually resulting in renewed bleeding from the unaffected tissue below the desiccation layer. Thin eschars are more flexible and therefore more desirable, but it has been difficult to obtain sufficient coagulation effects from thin eschars.
Causes of the uneven eschar created by prior fulguration techniques are not known with certainty, but numerous factors are theorized to play a role. One of the more significant contributory factors is probably changes in impedance in the arc pathway between the active electrode and the tissue. Impedance changes may result from variations in the distance which the arcs travel through the air, due to the changes in ionization potential between the active electrode and the tissue. It is virtually impossible for the surgeon to maintain the active electrode at a consistent distance from the tissue, particularly if the tissue is moving due to pulsation, or due to puckering and swelling as a result of applying the electrical energy. The arcing from random locations on the active electrode also creates different arc length pathways and hence impedances. The combined impedance of the tissue and the eschar changes with the application of electrical energy. The volatilization of the cells and vaporization of the moisture in the cells changes the relative impedance in a localized spot-to-spot manner on the surface of the tissue. The formation of the charred material also influences the arc pathways, presenting an opportunity for subsequent arcs to return to the tissue at the same location and thereby enlarge the pre-existing arc hole and create even further charring.
Another problem with conventional electrosurgery is that it is very difficult if not impossible to achieve effective fulguration on spongy or vascular tissue such as the liver or the spleen, or on other tissues from which there is a tendency for blood to continually ooze over the surface from the highly developed vascular network within the tissue. Often, only the surface of the oozing blood is coagulated, with no penetration to the surface of the tissue below the layer of blood. A superficial coagulum results on the surface of the blood, but this coagulum quickly sloughs away resulting in only temporary hemostasis. Of course, once the temporary coagulum sloughs away, bleeding continues. Even if a coagulation effect on the tissue surface can be established, it is easily destroyed or perforated by the arcs returning to the same locations causing the longer, deeper arc holes. The deeper arc holes perforate the eschar and extend into the viable tissue below the eschar to provide a pathway for continued bleeding. The heat created by the arcs causes boiling of moisture below the eschar, and the pressure of resulting vapor can also rupture the eschar to reinitiate bleeding.
Apart from the tissue disadvantages of conventional electrosurgical ful"

Tehelka Exposed: An unfair subscription model!

In the Information Era, Media creates memes. And Mainstream Media controls the circulation of memes. It is only once in a while the not-so-mainstream counterparts of Media Giants get to control the center stage and have their say in how we use our memes. In India, the 21st Century began with a News Portal called Tehelka appearing out of the blue, flinging ""sting operation"" and ""match fixing"" to our direction. Suddenly, that was the only news for sometime. India was impressed, so was I. With Fallen Heroes, the paperback from Buffalo Books that catapulted Tehelka into the radar of our fickle byte-sized social attention, the phrase ""sting operation"" became synonymous to ""Investigative Journalism"" Tarun Tejpal was all of a sudden a name everyone knew and a name many trusted.

In 2000, Tehelka made many of us glad that the overpaid heroes of a useless game got what they deserved. In 2001, they shocked us again. On March 13, 2001, Tarun wrote, ""In comparison, Fallen Heroes was a cake walk...In the final count, Fallen Heroes was only about being cheated of some entertainment; Operation West End is about being cheated of your nationalism."" The Shady Defense Deals that Tehelka brought to light made people conceive them as the torchbearers of truth and social commitment. It was after Operation West End and in 2001, I became a regular Tehelka Reader.

In 2007, as India was slowly recovering from Gujarat 2002, Tehelka shocked us again, coming out with a series of spy cam video footages that exposed how Narendra Modi knew the plan for the Riot and how he gave the Rioters three days to do whatever they wanted. Though the timing of the report was highly criticized as it was released just in time for Gujarat Elections, Tehelka reiterated its image in the minds of Indian Reading Public as a Socially Committed, Impartial and Courageous Media Group that stood for truth and justice.

As Media Giants were busy finding new ways to force-feed Indian Readers with the excess of Page 3 Journalism, Tehelka was trying its best to project itself as a Team of Public Interest Journalists. In 2009, Tehelka took its popular walk through ""the glitzy world Tehelka failed to get its head around"" with Nisha Susan. Nisha wrote:""The magazine sometimes seems like the healthy vegetable that you ought to eat, but don’t want to, when all around are bowls of mango and chocolate ice-cream"", projecting Tehelka as the only hope in an otherwise hopeless world of Epicurean-inspired Journalism.

To suit my Indian Psyche that strongly believes Politicians and Journalists are Social Workers and not Capitalist Professionals who are out there to make some money, Tehelka projected its image as a newspaper that never compromised Social Responsibility to Commercial Survival. Tarun and Co did successfully socialize the Educated Indian Middle Class and made them believe that if you are modern, intelligent and progressive you would sure regularly read Tehelka. Now that the brand is successfully built, looks like Tehelka has finally decided to go the Capitalist Way and make money which ever way they can."
204,23,10158,"sometimes, to simply be in love is to put oneself on the front lines of a very real and very bloody battlefield.

For having a career that has been regularly split between admirers and detractors and having also carried the dark (and, from my point of view, misplaced) mantle of misogyny on my back most of that time, I think one of the few real thematic threads that exists in my work is a yearning to see how far the boundaries of our feelings can and should be stretched in the name of that precious word.

LOVE.

And so I finally decided to do something about it. I'd written enough stories about people falling out of love—tales of men and women going to war against each other. This time, I decided to write a flat-out romance and one that ends realistically but happily. The getting there, however, is always the exciting part of the journey for me. Who would the lucky couple be? As fate would have it, I landed upon the idea of a pair of adult step-siblings falling in love and the fallout that ensues because of one night of bliss spent together. ""Step-siblings in love"" is a funny little taboo in many (or most) cultures, a kind of social urban legend that refuses to go away even when the actual truth is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this particular romantic connection. Still, when you describe this situation to most anyone, their first real response is a pained face and some form of ""Ewwwww...""

And so it goes.

People love to judge other people, especially who and why we love and if that's okay in our collective opinions. If you read fiction or non-fiction, even as far back as the Bible (and you can put that book into whichever category you see fit), figures both real and imaginary are more than happy to say whom we can love and/or why not. I wrestled for a long time with the idea of should there be other characters in this play but ultimately it was best as a two-hander in real time. After all, the initial test of a relationship that falls outside the norm of convention is always going to land first at the feet of the participants in that relationship. Thus, I decided to spend the early morning hours of this play with ""Doug""and ""Beth"" and see what happens when two people who have been raised as brother and sister (but who have long harbored crushes on each other) hop drunkenly into bed and then wake up to face the very real consequences of their actions.

It was a fun situation to create and a nice ride to go on with the characters. Playwriting is exactly that to me—at its best, it's a roller-coaster that I've been allowed to get on and take for a spin. I've been on rollercoasters before so I know in"

The third UK series of The X Factor was broadcast on ITV between 19 August and 16 December 2006, with Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh mentoring and judging the finalists.

16–24s

The ""16–24s"" category was mentored by Simon Cowell. Contestants in this category were either gender aged 16 to 24. The eight candidates at judges' houses were: Nikitta Angus, Stacey Barnes, Leona Lewis, Ashley McKenzie, Carlo Muscutelli, Ray Quinn, Shaun Rogerson and Gemma Sampson. Cowell chose:

Nikitta Angus
Nikitta Angus (born 19 October 1988 in Manchester, England) was raised in Glasgow. Her aunt, Katie Angus, was also in the over 25s category  but failed to make the final 4. At her audition, Nikitta performed ""Dimming of the Day"" written by Richard Thompson, which she recorded with her aunt for her mother's funeral in 2005. Angus was due to be a contestant in 2005 but was knocked down by a car ten minutes before her audition. She finished in seventh place after being eliminated in the bottom-two showdown with Ray Quinn in week 5.

In 2010 Nikitta's career began an upward climb, collaborating with many household names in the production of music for her forthcoming album. Nikitta can also be seen as a model, representing various fashion franchises across the UK, and is managed by Northern Star Artist Management. In July 2010, she participated in the Channel 5 TV show Don't Stop Believing with cheerleading squad Blok and two other singers, but was eliminated by the judges after the group lost a sing-off.

Angus is currently a member of reality group G*Mania.

Leona Lewis

Leona Lewis (born 3 April 1985) grew up in North London and often listened to her father's record collection. She says ""I loved listening to Minnie Riperton and Anita Baker, plus 80s big vocalists Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Oleta Adams and more recently Eva Cassidy, and at the age of six, ""I decided to be a singer"". Lewis wrote her first song at the age of 12, and attended the Sylvia Young Stage School and the BRIT"

207,13,9730,"and-out lawyer blunders — the type of action or inaction that leads to successful malpractice suits by the injured client — do not qualify as `mistake' or `excusable neglect' within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(1)"") (citation and quotation marks omitted); Yapp v. Excel Corp., 186 F.3d 1222, 1231 (10th Cir.1999) (""[A] party who simply misunderstands or fails to predict the legal consequences of his deliberate acts cannot later, once the lesson is learned, turn back the clock to undo those mistakes.""); Cashner v. Freedom Stores, Inc., 98 F.3d 572, 577 (10th Cir.1996) (""If the mistake alleged is a party's litigation mistake, we have declined to grant relief under Rule 60(b)(1) when the mistake was the result of a deliberate and counseled decision by the party.""); United States v. Bank of New York, 14 F.3d 756, 759 (2d Cir.1994) (""When a party makes a deliberate, strategic choice to settle, she cannot be relieved of such a choice merely because her assessment of the consequences was incorrect."").


13
We agree that Rule 60(b)(1) is not intended to remedy the effects of a litigation decision that a party later comes to regret through subsequently-gained knowledge that corrects the erroneous legal advice of counsel. For purposes of subsection (b)(1), parties should be bound by and accountable for the deliberate actions of themselves and their chosen counsel. This includes not only an innocent, albeit careless or negligent, attorney mistake, but also intentional attorney misconduct. Such mistakes are more appropriately addressed through malpractice claims. See also United States v. Prairie Pharmacy, Inc., 921 F.2d 211, 214 (9th Cir.1990).


14
Accordingly, neither of Latshaw's alleged mistakes are among those that Rule 60(b)(1) is intended to remedy. Even if Latshaw genuinely believed that her counsel intended to resign or that she may have been liable for the defendants' attorneys' fees, Latshaw's beliefs do not provide grounds to rescind her acceptance. These mistakes, if true, arose from attorney misconduct. A party will not be released from a poor litigation decision made because of inaccurate information or advice, even if provided by an attorney. Latshaw's decision to accept the offer was deliberate and independent. In such situations, regret caused by new knowledge does not justify rescinding a decision.


15
Latshaw also contends that her mistaken beliefs entitle her to Rule 60(b)(1) relief because she did not possess sufficient understanding to have ever validly accepted the offer. Latshaw cites a passage from a decision by the Eighth Circuit: ""[W]hen considering a Rule 68 offer, the offeree needs to have a clear understanding of the terms of the offer in order to make an informed decision whether to accept it."" Radecki v. Amoco Oil Co., 858 F.2d 397, 403 (8th Cir.1988). This argument lacks merit. Misunderstanding an offer's terms is not the same as misunderstanding factors to be weighed in deciding to accept the offer. Latshaw understood the unambiguous settlement terms — that she would receive $15,000 in exchange for terminating the litigation — when signing the offer of judgment. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Latshaw relief under Rule 60(b)(1).


B. Rule 60(b)(3)


16
Rule 60(b)(3) permits relief ""from a final judgment... for... fraud... or other misconduct of an adverse party."" Citing subsection (b)(3), Latshaw contends that Nygaard committed two fraudulent acts sufficient to warrant Rule 60(b) relief: (1) Nygaard misinformed Latshaw that she could be liable for the defendants' legal fees, and (2) Nygaard misinformed Latshaw that Harrison intended to resign. Latshaw argues that Nygaard's fraud, in part, induced Latshaw to sign the Rule 68 offer. The district court again denied Latshaw's requested relief, noting that Latshaw ""expressly instructed her counsel to file the acceptance,"" a situation ""clearly"" not among those meriting relief as fraud.


17
We agree. Even if it is true that Nygaard committed fraud, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the circumstances failed to warrant Rule 60(b)(3) relief. Subsection (b)(3) permits relief only when the fraud was committed by ""an adverse party."" See In re Grantham Bros., 922 F.2d 1438, 1442-43 (9th Cir.1991"

To summarize their system, the voltage potential field was measured by applying a direct current pulse across the core and measuring the voltage potential at all electrodes, essentially applying the 4--wire resistance technique over all electrodes in turn. The PC cycles through the sequence by measuring the voltage potential at every electrode before changing the current source electrodes. The current is supplied by the data acquisition (DAQ) card. The scale and resistivity meter are used to calibrate the EIT measurements by providing the actual saturation and resistivity \[[@b22-sensors-11-11774]\]. EIDORS toolkit, which was developed for applications to nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem, was utilized. Experiments conducted by Stacey *et al*. have indicated that 3D EIT is a viable technique for studying the displacement characteristics of fluids with contrasting resistivity and is capable of detecting displacement fronts in near real-time. Again, in our perspective, EM tomography imaging techniques have been underestimated in NDE community and should be exploited more in future. More discussion will be conducted in the last section of this paper.

In contrast to EIT and ERT, electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) imaging attempts to image the permittivity distribution of an object by measuring the electrical capacitances between sets of electrodes placed around its periphery. Yang *et al*. reviewed the existing image reconstruction methods for ECT, including linear back-projection, singular value decomposition, Tikhonov regularization, Newton--Raphson, iterative Tikhonov, the steepest descent method, Landweber iteration, the conjugate gradient method, algebraic reconstruction techniques, simultaneous iterative reconstruction techniques and model-based reconstruction \[[@b23-sensors-11-11774]\]. [Figure 11](#f11-sensors-11-11774){ref-type=""fig""} shows a typical EIT/ERT/ECT system with an multiple electrode sensor.

In addition to Yang's comprehensive review paper on ECT reconstruction, Soleimani *et al*. studied the nonlinearity of the inverse permittivity problem of ECT and implemented a regularized Gauss--Newton for nonlinear image reconstruction with adoption of finite element method(FEM) as the forward model solver \[[@b24-sensors-11-11774]\], recently in 2005. The ECT results of four plastic rods is shown in [Figure 12](#f12-sensors-11-11774){ref-type=""fig""}. Soleimani and colleagues presented a Helmholtz type Regularization Method for ECT reconstruction in 2010 \[[@b25-sensors-11-11774]\]. More recent literatures on ECT development can be referred to \[[@b26-sensors-11-11774],[@b27-sensors-11-11774]\] and \[[@b28-sensors-11-11774]\].

The other advances in magnetic based imaging other than the increasing in sensitivity include but are not limited to that, for example in 2004, Knauss *et al*. reported a high resolution, non-contact magnetic based current imaging technology localizing high resistance defects in packages to within 30 *μm*, an order of magnitude better than time domain reflectometry \[[@b29-sensors-11-11774]\]. They also applied this novel imaging technique on various applications, such as present and next generation semiconductor devices by introducing the very low magnetic field \[[@b30-sensors-11-11774]\].

2.2.. Quasi-Static Imaging Methods
----------------------------------

This section reviews the electromagnetic imaging methods with low excitation frequencies: quasi-static imaging techniques such as conventional eddy current imaging. Several hybrid imaging techniques utilizing eddy current are also summarized here including the EC-based magneto-optic (MO) imaging and EC-based giant magnetoresistive (GMR) imaging.

215,4,16659,". Such incidents, however, became less common after mid-1870, and the organization in general ceased to exist after Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 1871, which permitted the president of the United States to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in cases of secret conspiracy. Although federal efforts played a role in the dissolving the Klan, just as important was the growing reluctance of the Southern white leadership to tolerate violence.

Around the time of World War I a new Ku Klux Klan, patterned after the original one, made its appearance. The resurgent group began in Georgia, where William J. Simmons dedicated it at a cross-burning on Stone Mountain on Thanksgiving eve, 1915. The success of D. W. Griffith's epic film of the same year, Birth of a Nation, based on Thomas Dixon's novel The Clansman (1905), with its vivid portrayals of Radical Republican excesses, had helped to fan the flames of racial animosity, which had smoldered since Reconstruction. Also fueling the fire was a growing American nativist movement with its concomitant distrust of Catholics, Jews, African Americans, and other ""foreign"" elements. At first the new Klan grew slowly, but in the aftermath of World War I, the organization spread rapidly, not only in the South and Southwest, but also through the Midwest and to both coasts. At its height in the early 1920s the new Klan boasted some two million members. As before, its members or those posing as Klansmen perpetrated acts of violence, and although atrocities were committed across the nation, they were generally concentrated in the South. Some Texans were receptive to the Klan's angry and insular message, and by the early 1920s membership in the state organization numbered in the tens of thousands. Hooded legions paraded in Texas cities and towns, and cross-burnings, intended to show the power of the ""invisible empire,"" became all too common.

The revived Klan's main public appeal was as a fraternal lodge, a refuge for white, Protestant America. It promised to reform politics, to enforce prohibition, and to champion traditional morality. The preponderance of the membership was concentrated in small towns, but the organization also spread to Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and the other large cities. Members were drawn from all sectors of society, and many civic leaders, politicians, and law-enforcement officials either belonged or deferred to the Klan. Many officials, however, opposed it. When Waco Klan No. 33 tried to march in the small Central Texas town of Lorena, the sheriff of McLennan County tried to stop the demonstration, touching off a riot in which several people were wounded and one man stabbed to death. The growing violence attributed to the Klan caused wide resentment, and by 1922 a number of anti-Klan organizations had formed across the state. Recognizing the threat to the organization's growth, Dallas dentist Hiram Wesley Evans, who was elected ""imperial wizard,"" or national leader, at the organization's first national convention in November 1922, sought to reform the Klan and to change its image. He placed strict controls on local groups, which were, for instance, no longer allowed to wear Klan regalia except at Klan-sponsored events, and sought to extend Klan power by working to have members elected to important political posts.

The strategy was especially successful in Texas. With a membership of perhaps as many as 100,000, the Klan used its united voting block to elect state legislators, sheriffs, judges, and other local and state officials. Its greatest success, however, was in securing the election of Earle Bradford Mayfield to the United States Senate in 1922. The following year the Klan established firm control of city governments in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Wichita Falls, and the order probably had a majority in the House of Representatives of the Thirty-eighth Texas Legislature, which met in January. By the end of 1922 the paid membership swelled to as many as 150,000, and Kluxers looked forward to even greater triumphs. The year 1923, however, was the"
216,29,429,"Why one-dimensional Larsson wasn’t enough for Hall The Edmonton Oilers have bolstered their blueline, but the defenceman they added isn’t worth the premium of an elite scorer, Travis Yost writes.

Last Wednesday, the hockey world was exposed to two of the biggest one-for-one trades in the salary cap era.

Though I think the biggest winner on the day was Nashville in their ability to acquire all-world defender P.K. Subban, I do recognize that there were other factors at play with the deal. Montreal has been very guarded about the how and why behind the Subban trade, but it’s more than reasonable to assume that there was something well beyond on-ice performance that drove that transaction. There’s also the realization that Nashville was very incentivized to pull the trigger on the proposal – not only were they getting one of the better players in the universe, but they were getting out from a truly poisonous contract.

That’s why the Edmonton and New Jersey swap is a bit more interesting. This was a bona fide hockey trade – a team moving a talented winger at an extremely high cost to obtain a young defender. Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli described the high cost associated with the trade as the market cost for acquiring a first-pairing defenceman. There were, undoubtedly, additional pressures in the sense that Edmonton felt the need to shake up the roster to some degree. A repeat of last season, I’m sure, would be considered unacceptable by the decision makers there.

The problem with this trade is that I’m not sure Adam Larsson is the player that Edmonton thinks he is, and the Oilers are thus assuming significant risk in this deal. The piece moving from the organization is one of the best scorers in the game, a top-10 5-on-5 point producer on a team that’s struggled mightily to do much of anything in recent years.

In return, the Oilers have acquired a steady, defensively talented blueliner who has all of nine goals in 274 games played. Larsson can certainly play, but is a seemingly one-dimensional player worth the cost of a Taylor Hall?

I’ll be the first to remind all that goals (and points) aren’t the best indicator of production for defencemen. The more concerning part here is that from a shot analysis, the Devils were generally better with Larsson on the bench than not (about +2.5 per 60 minutes). That’s something we rarely see from first-pairing defenders. You can go through the list if you don’t believe me – the names higher on the list tend to be Norris Trophy contenders every season, while the names lower on the list seem more ripe for a buyout.

There’s an important caveat here, and that’s the fact that Larsson was brutally deployed by the Devils coaching staff over the last few years. There were many games where just about every single defensive zone start saw Adam Larsson and his partner sent over the boards to stop the bleeding and try and flip the run of play. That, understandably, has been a counterpoint made by observers regarding his average-to-middling shot differentials over the years.

If the theory is that Larsson’s been in a really tough developmental spot because of his brutal deployment, it stands to reason that a more friendly two-way approach for Todd McLellan might do wonders for both Larsson and his team. We would theorize the following would occur with more favourable zone starts: (a) more favourable shot differentials; (b) more offensive opportunities created; and"

218,14,22757,"Two researchers say they have uncovered a bunch of new information about the world's largest patent ""aggregator,"" Intellectual Ventures.

Founded by former Microsoft chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold about a decade ago, the company's main business is getting patents, then using them to extract licensing fees or legal settlements from other companies.

The impolite word for companies who use patents this way, rather than in the course of making and selling products, is ""patent troll.""

Intellectual Ventures is secretive about how it works. Until a lawsuit last year, nobody knew exactly who its investors were, or who had licensed its patents. (Turns out that Microsoft, Apple, Sony and a ton of other prominent tech companies have invested and/or taken licenses. So have a number of universities.)

Robin Feldman, a law professor at U.C. Hastings, and lawyer Tom Ewing decided to find out more.

People told them their task was impossible. They write: ""'You can’t find out anything about them; don’t even try,' is a chant that has been whispered in intellectual property circles for a number of years. It motivated us to take a hard look, and the information eventually unraveled like the yarn from an old sweater.""

In January, they published a paper in the Stanford Law Review (PDF here) with their findings.

Here's some of what they wrote:

Intellectual Ventures has between 30,000 and 60,000 patents. That's a rough estimate. But even the low number makes Intellectual Ventures (IV) the 5th largest patent portfolio of any U.S. company, and 15th in the world. Nearly all of those patents originated elsewhere. IV does very little inventing of its own.

It uses more than 1,200 shell companies. IV's patent holdings and legal actions are hard to track because it often assigns patents to shell companies. The researchers say they discovered at least 1,276 of these, and they ""have little doubt that other shell companies have been formed.""

About half its patents originated outside the U.S. A lot of patents are not valued as highly overseas as they are in the U.S. ""This suggests that Intellectual Ventures may be acting as an arbitrageur to exploit the disparities in intellectual property valuation between the United States and the rest of the world,"" write the researchers.

Big companies invest, then use its patents for defense. For instance, Verizon paid $350 million for patent licenses an equity stake in one of IV's funds in 2008. When TiVo sued Verizon for patent infringement, Verizon ""purchased a patent from one of Intellectual Ventures’ shell companies, which was then put to work as a counterclaim in the TiVo suit,"" say the researchers.

How it gets patents from smaller companies. According to the researchers, IV has a ""turnkey"" method for getting patents from smaller companies. IV pays the company a one-time fee and a percentage of any profits it makes from the patents. IV then ""assumes the costs of maintaining the portfolio, and gains the right to go after other companies."" In the case of a company called Digimarc, IV agreed to pay $36 million over three years, plus 20% of the profits from all successful licensing and litigation.

Feldman and Ewing compare IV's activities to ""privateering,"" a now-abolished kind of warfare from the 1800"

Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis are a Canadian animation duo. On January 24, 2012, they received their second Oscar nomination, for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) animated short film, Wild Life.  In addition to writing and directing the film, Forbis and Tilby drew and painted every animation frame in guache, and wrote the lyrics for the film's final song. They were only able to work on Wild Life part-time, due to commercial obligations, and the film is reported to have taken them from six to over seven years, from concept to completion.

Both originally from Alberta, they first met in Vancouver at the Emily Carr College of Art and Design. In 2003, they relocated from Montreal to Calgary, where Forbis was raised. In addition to their NFB work, they have collaborated on workshops and commercials, working with Los Angeles-based Acme Filmworks on major ad campaigns, most notably for United Airlines. In 2007, they founded the Bleak Midwinter Film Festival in their home neighbourhood of Inglewood, Calgary.

Personal lives

Wendy Tilby 
Wendy Tilby was born in 1960 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Tilby studied visual arts and literature at the University of Victoria before studying film and animation at the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design, where she met Forbis. Tilby used to teach animation at Harvard and Concordia University. Tilby was also external examiner for animation at the Royal College of Art in London from 2007-2009.

Amanda Forbis
Amanda Forbis attended the University of Lethbridge as well as the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. Like Tilby, she went on from the Emily Carr Institute to complete animation work for the National Film Board of Canada on the 1995  short The Reluctant Deckhand. Forbis has also worked as an instructor at the Arts Umbrella Children's Art Centre in Vancouver, as well as leading many animation workshops for children.

Animation Styles

Strings
This film was not a collaboration between Tilby and Forbis, it was only worked on by Tilby. The animation style used is reminiscent of Caroline Leaf's method of painting on frosted glass, used in her 1976 short film, The Street. However, Tilby used bottom-lighting in her film, instead of top lighting like Caroline Leaf. She used an animation camera apparatus and worked directly under the camera, she applied, moved, and removed the colored paints on the glass until the frame was finished. When the frame was complete she took two frames worth of footage from the overhead camera. Then she would modify the image to make the next frame, and repeat the process."

[**Abstract.**]{} Let $f$ be a multivariate density and $f_n$ be a kernel estimate of $f$ drawn from the $n$-sample $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ of i.i.d. random variables with density $f$. We compute the asymptotic rate of convergence towards 0 of the volume of the symmetric difference between the $t$-level set $\{f\geq t\}$ and its plug-in estimator $\{f_n\geq t\}$. As a corollary, we obtain the exact rate of convergence of a plug-in type estimate of the density level set corresponding to a fixed probability for the law induced by $f$.

[**Key-words:**]{} Kernel estimate, Density level sets, Hausdorff measure.

[**2000 Mathematics Subject Classification:**]{} 62H12, 62H30.

[**1. Introduction.**]{} Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in estimation of density level sets and in related multivariate mappings problems. The main reason is the recent advent of powerfull mathematical tools and computational machinery that render these problems much more tractable. One of the most powerful application of density level sets estimation is in unsupervised [*cluster analysis*]{} (see Hartigan \[1\]), where one tries to break a complex data set into a series of piecewise similar groups or structures, each of which may then be regarded as a separate class of data, thus reducing overall data compexity. But there are many other fields where the knowledge of density level sets is of great interest. For example, Devroye and Wise \[2\], Grenander \[3\], Cuevas \[4\] and Cuevas and Fraiman \[5\] used density support estimation for pattern recognition and for detection of the abnormal behavior of a system.

In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the $t$-level set ${\cal L}(t)$ of a multivariate probability density $f$ with support in ${I\!\!R}^k$ from independent random variables $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ with density $f$. Recall that for $t\geq 0$, the $t$-level set of the density $f$ is defined as follows : $${\cal L}(t)=\{x\in{I\!\!R}^k\, :\, f(x)\geq t\}.$$

The question now is how to define the estimates of ${{\cal L}}(t)$ from the $n$-sample $X_1,\cdots,X_n$? Even in a nonparametric framework, there are many possible answers to this question, depending on the restrictions one can impose on the level set and the density under study. Mainly, there are two families of such estimators : the [*plug-in*]{} estimators and the estimators constructed by an [*excess mass*]{} approach. Assume that an estimator $f_n$ of the density $f$ is available. Then a straightforward estimator of the level set ${{\cal L}}(t)$ is $\{f_n\geq t\}$, the plug-in estimator. Molchanov \[6, 7\] and Cuevas and Fraiman \[5\] proved consistency of these estimators and obtained some rates of convergence. The excess mass approach suggest to first consider the empirical mapping $M_n$ defined for every borel set $L\subset{I\!\!R}^k$ by $$M_n(L)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n {\bf 1}_{\{X_i\in L\}}-t \lambda(L),$$ where $\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure on ${I\!\!R}^k$. A natural estimator of ${{\cal L}}(t)$ is a maximizer of $M_n(L)$ over a given class of"

ILLINOIS FOCUS: APRIL 5th ELECTION ENDORSEMENTS

April 5th is an important local election in Illinois. This will be a low voter turnout election, so your vote REALLY counts. Here are endorsements and information from Democracy for America:

John ArenaAlderman 45th Wardarenafor45.com

The 45th Ward has been represented by a machine politician for almost 25 years. Now is the time for DFA members to elect a progressive alderman who will fight for transparency and accountability in city government.

John Arena is that progressive. In his first campaign for office, John has put forth an aggressive campaign platform that would open up the political culture, develop local small businesses and reduce crime.

John's running a campaign fueled by people power, with volunteers going door-to-door, making phone calls and more. Join the people-powered campaign and help put it over the top today.

Here is Jjohn Arena's statement to DFA:

Background:

As a child, I moved with my family to Chicago’s suburbs from New Jersey. Since graduating from Northern Illinois University in 1990. I have lived on Chicago’s north and northwest side. My wife, Jill, and I run a small marketing and graphic design company. We are raising our two children in the Portage Park neighborhood. They are 15 and 10 years old.

Over the last decade, I have been active in numerous community organizations. I served three terms as communications director and two terms as Vice-President of the Portage Park Neighborhood Association. I have served on the Economic Restructuring and the Promotions Committee of the Six Corners Association. On a more personal note, I have coached my son’s Little League for seven years (winning the league championship this year) and been deeply involved in the parent-teacher organization for my daughter’s elementary school.

I have been volunteering on political campaigns for progressive political candidates for years and over the last several years I have worked for candidates endorsed by Northside DFA, including Joe Laiacona, Daniel Biss, Forrest Claypool and, of course, President Obama.

Goals:

My top goal is to bring responsive government to the 45th Ward. This ward has been run by a machine politician, Alderman Pat Levar, for"

Marthinus Christoffel Johannes van Schalkwyk (born 10 November 1959) is a South African politician, academic, lawyer, and apartheid-era intelligence operative. He is also a former MP and Minister of Tourism in the Cabinet of South Africa. Formerly Premier of the Western Cape and Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of South Africa, he was the leader of the New National Party from its inception on 8 September 1997 until its dissolution on 9 April 2005. He was appointed Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in the Thabo Mbeki administration after merging his party with the ruling African National Congress (ANC), despite the poor performance of the former in the 2004 General Election.

Early life and career
Van Schalkwyk matriculated from Pietersburg High School in 1977. He was a national serviceman in the South African Defence Force (SADF) from 1978 to 1979 and would later attend the Rand Afrikaans University where he earned a Masters of Arts in Political Science and a B Proc. (a junior legal degree). As a prominent student leader of whites in the 1980s, he was a founding member and chairman of ""Jeugkrag"" - Youth Power - an organisation purportedly opposed to the Afrikaner establishment, but which was secretly funded by military intelligence. According to a top secret document supplied to WikiLeaks, Van Schalkwyk ""confirmed that he was an agent for the Intelligence Services"". Later, he would lecture Political Science at Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) and University of Stellenbosch.

Political career
His political career began during the late apartheid years at the Rand Afrikaans University as chairman of the Student Representative Council (SRC), the Afrikaanse Studentebond (ASB), and later of the Ruiterwag, the youth wing of the Broederbond.

Van Schalkwyk succeeded F. W. de Klerk as leader of the National Party in 1996, and reorganised it on 8 September 1997 as the New National Party in a bid to distance the party from its apartheid"

Evidential photographs of the alleged victim were never disclosed to the defense and were incorrectly handled. Specifically, ten years after conviction, Jeff Feldman, under the Freedom of Information Act, obtained copies of the five photographs taken of Linda by police at the alleged crime scene immediately after the alleged offense. The photographs were in a locker in a police garage.

The rape case was coincidentally prosecuted simultaneously with the custody case. This action alone put William in the middle of a ‘rock and a hard place’. Since the divorce court had frozen all his (their) assets, he had no money to hire a lawyer or to even make bond. Yet, because of his listed assets, the criminal court ruled that he was not indigent (or poor enough) and refused to provide him with a court appointed lawyer.

A four page report submitted with a sworn statement dated January 8, 1998 by an acclaimed forensics photographer. John Valor, utilizing new and modern techniques, stated that the pictures of Linda showed no scratches, tape marks or abnormalities of any kind, absolute. Furthermore, he states that marks would have been identifiable and clearly visible if there had been any at all.

This brings to the forefront an additional discrepancy that, under the law, if a witness (in this case a government witness) gives false testimony, a convicted prisoner should be entitled to a new trial, but William Hetherington has yet to receive one. In the least, the witness should be charged with perjury.

Bustos’ challenge will be to recruit candidates and help raise the money needed for Democrats to keep the House in 2020. The spot puts Bustos in the national spotlight. Bustos weighed a 2016 run for Illinois senator, but instead, decided to stay in the House and start a bid to climb the leadership ladder.

236,8,6200,"Jon Beason Has Broken Bone, Torn Ligament in Foot: The New York Giants announced on Friday that middle linebacker Jon Beason suffered a ligament tear and a small fracture to the sesamoid bone in his right foot during Thursday’s Organized Team Activity (OTA) practice.

While Beason remains hopeful he will return early in the 2014 regular season, the Giants did not announce any projected timetable for his return. And since Beason will undergo further evaluation by specialists on Monday, the treatment options, including possible surgery, have not yet been decided upon. Unidentified team sources have told the media that surgery is likely and that Beason may be out three months.

“The prognosis is X amount of time and (the regular-season opener on September 8th) is within that timeframe,” said Beason in the team’s press release. “I expect to be back (for that game). If not, I’ll be back as soon as I can. That’s really how you have to look at it. If it’s not 16 (games played), maybe it’s 15 or 14. Whatever it is, you want it to be that number as opposed to one.”

Beason was hurt defending a pass play during practice.

“It’s just one of those things – you have freak injuries,” Beason said. “I was just changing directions. I would say that the movement was a little unorthodox, I was flexing with the big toe in the ground and then I pivoted on it all the way around. It’s a movement that I often do that allows me to come in and out of my breaks faster. I literally felt like I stepped in like a sprinkler head hole. I just felt it give right away, so the next step I knew I couldn’t put the foot down.

“I had a bad feeling. I really felt that I that I had torn the extensor, which is the tendon with the muscle, it’s how your big toe functions. That would have been season-ending. So at least now there’s a procedure, possibly. We haven’t decided if it’s something that’s invasive or something that you just kind of let heal on its own. The timeframe is about the same, but it’s not season-ending, so I’m happy about that.

“I know that mentally you can’t get down on yourself. You have to understand the situation and what you can control. The toughest part is knowing that there are a lot of people obviously in the locker room, the coaching staff, the organization and even the city that are counting on me to do my part and do it well. And it’s unfortunate because I worked so hard training. I feel great, I’m in good shape, I’m moving around a lot faster than I have in recent years. To have this setback kind of gets you back down to ground zero and then you have to work yourself back into football shape again. That’s disheartening, but it’s something that I think I can accomplish even under bad circumstances.”

The specialist who Beason will see on Monday is someone who Beason has a relationship with. He operated on Beason’s ruptured left Achilles tendon in 2011. Beason also had microfracture surgery after the 2012 NFL season.

“He knows my body,” Beason said. “I think the world of him. I was impartial to doing it here with (the Giants doctor), but I think they wanted to make me feel comfortable to go down there and get a second opinion. He wants to do some more tests to determine what he thinks is best and then those two will sit down and figure out the best plan for me.

“I’m prepared for (their decision). I know what I have to do and I’m going to do it well. I’m certain that we’ll get the result we need. I’m in good hands, the proper methodology, and it should work and then you go from there. It’s easy when you’re driven, you have a goal in mind and that’s to play on the opener and obviously be the best player I can be to help this organization win, help my teammates win and to have a successful season.

239,27,7195,"Blaise Pascal was one of the most important scholars of the 17th century. He was a great scientist, mathematician, and inventor, famous for many key breakthroughs. He was also a devoted Catholic and wrote what is considered to be one of the best apologetic works of his time.

But he wasn’t always a believer. After spending most of his life only nominally interested in religion, he had a dramatic conversion – and it was due to an incredible and dramatic mystical experience.

[See also: This Agnostic Scientist Converted After Witnessing a Miracle at Lourdes]

[See also: The Miracle that Led “Obi-Wan Kenobi” to Convert to Catholicism]

Pascal was born in France in 1623. The second of three children, his mother died when he was just 3 years old. A few years later, his father moved their family to Paris.

Pascal’s intelligence was evident from a young age, so his father decided to personally educate him at home. And it paid off: when Pascal was just 16 years old, he was already making mathematical breakthroughs and engaging in academic discourse with professional mathematicians. By age 19, he had invented his own mechanical calculator, about 50 units of which he sold to various wealthy families in Europe. During his 20s and early 30s, Pascal did important work with mathematical probability and made important discoveries related to fluids and pressure.

In 1646, his father fell and broke his hip, a devastating injury in that time. The two doctors that worked with his father over the next few months happened to be devout Catholics (though they were a part of the small but growing Jansenist sect). Through their friendship and conversations with him, Pascal started to think seriously about religion for the first time in his life.

Many biographers call this his “first conversion.” It was mostly intellectual and did not last long. When his father died in 1651, he moved on from religion and entered what many call his “worldly period.” Soon after, his younger sister decided to join a convent, to which her third of their father’s estate was given. Since his older sister had already used her part as a dowry, 30-year-old Pascal was left with just his third of his father’s estate, without his parents, and with both of his sisters fully engaged in other vocations.

In other words, he was poor and alone. And that is when God entered his life in an amazing way.

It was November 23rd, 1654 and Pascal was at home alone. The sun was set and all was dark. He was most likely preparing for bed when, suddenly, at around 10:30pm, something supernatural happened. It’s not clear exactly what he saw, but the amazing mystical experience lasted for a full two hours. As soon as it was over, he grabbed a pen and paper and wrote down what was swirling through his head.

Here’s what he wrote:

The year of grace 1654,

Monday, 23 November, feast of St. Clement, pope and martyr, and others in the martyrology. Vigil of St. Chrysogonus, martyr, and others. From about half past ten at night until about half past midnight,

FIRE.

GOD of Abraham, GOD of Isaac, GOD of Jacob

not of the philosophers and of the learned.

Certitude. Certitude. Feeling. Joy. Peace.

GOD of Jesus Christ.

My God and your God.

Your GOD will be my God.

Forgetfulness of the world and of everything, except GOD.

He is only found by the ways taught in the Gospel.

Grandeur of the human soul.

Righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I have known you.

Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy.

I have departed from him:

They have forsaken me, the fount of living water.

My God, will you leave me?

Let me not be separated from him forever.

This is eternal life, that they know you, the one true God, and the one that you sent, Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ.

I left him; I fled him, renounced, crucified.

Let me never be separated from him.

He is only kept securely by the ways taught in the Gospel:

Renunciation, total and sweet.

Complete submission to Jesus Christ and to my director."

Got an import error all of a sudden

So I set up a virtualenv on Ubuntu, installed everything, and got the development site running with runserver. All my own unit tests passed, but many of the Django packages' unit tests were not passing.
So I tried doing git bisect to figure this out, checking out the very earliest commits I had made. I went too early in history, back when the development environment was using different database engines, packages, etc., and the site of course couldn't run. I then decided to work on something else more important than failing Django unit tests (since my own were working), and so I went back to the latest commit in the development branch.
I fired up runserver again, but this time when I reloaded the homepage, I was met with the error:

Would you be happy to see your doctor online? Growing numbers of patients seem to be attracted by the convenience. And doctors are also finding it useful as health services come under pressure from growing and ageing populations.

Lydia Campbell-Hill, a 35-year-old doctor from Cornwall, England, says switching to online consultations has transformed her life.

""As a 'part-time' GP [general practitioner] working three days a week, I was doing 39 hours or more,"" she says.

""I was solo parenting, paying vast amounts on childcare, and not seeing my child much.""

After leaving her clinic-based job and working mainly online from her lounge or kitchen, she says: ""My stress levels dropped and I can fit my hours around school, even working a couple of hours in the evening after my son has gone to bed.""

Doug Sweeny, from US primary care provider One Medical, says giving doctors the flexibility to work remotely greatly improves their quality of life.

""The virtual team, they may have kids at home, they may be in places like Hawaii,"" he says.

""It works brilliantly, it actually helps if you need a flexible schedule or are in an area [where] we don't have bricks and mortar.""

Quality of life is one thing, but telemedicine is also about hard-headed economics.

""A significant portion of the patients doctors see daily are quick follow-ups of well-managed, long-term conditions, lab results, or script renewals,"" says Oyuka Byambasuren, a Mongolian GP researching technology and healthcare delivery, ""and these can be addressed through teleconsultations.""

It is a point echoed by Luke Buhl-Nielsen, from Swedish telemedicine app KRY (which uses the name LIVI outside Scandinavia).

""In Sweden, up to 45% of the volume that comes into general practice can be dealt with digitally,"" he says.

And virtual visits are roughly two-thirds cheaper to provide than in-person visits, research suggests.

Doctor shortages is a growing problem around the world.

The US could have up to 50,000 fewer than it needs by 2030, research firm IHS Markit believes. In Asia, the doctor shortage is fuelling the rapid rise of telehealth apps such as Halodoc, Doctor Anywhere, and Ping An Good Doctor.

Private equity firms and venture capitalists are piling in to the sector, investing billions, as healthcare providers respond to the app-savvy, more consumer-focused generations.

The sixth specific order complemented the fifth by requiring service providers to notify the government agents about relevant service changes to the Subject Telephone. Authorization Order at 4-5.
The seventh and eighth specific orders imposed obligations on the service providers relating only to the pen/trap devices and made no mention of cell site information: the former required service providers to furnish agents with all information and assistance necessary to accomplish the devices' installation and use, and the latter required providers to furnish the results of the devices' use to agents as soon as practicable and on a continuous basis. Finally, the ninth specific order directed the investigating agency to compensate service providers for certain expenses and the tenth provided for appropriate secrecy and sealing. Authorization Order at 5-6.
In sum, the Authorization Order, like the Application, cited only the SCA  and not the Pen/Trap Statute  in connection with the disclosure of cell site information. The Authorization Order likewise directed the relevant carriers to provide cell site information but did not refer to the disclosure of such information in the specific directions regarding changes to the Subject Telephone, the furnishing of assistance, or the speedy and continuous disclosures of information during the pendency of the order.
3. The Provider Order
The Provider Order contained one ""whereas"" clause followed by eleven specific orders. The latter were essentially verbatim repetitions of the specific orders in the Authorization Order, and I therefore do not describe them at length here. The former recited that the court had ""entered an order pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, §§ 3121-26 and § 2703(d) authorizing the use of a pen register [with cell site location authority] and a trap and trace device for a period of sixty days from the date of this order on"" the Subject Telephone. Provider Order at 1 (brackets in original). The phrasing suggests that the only cell site information the government contemplated obtaining as a result of the Authorization Order would be prospective (i.e., pertaining to calls not yet made at the time of the order), rather than the disclosure of actual records held by the service providers about previously made calls. The phrasing further suggests that the prospective cell site information the government sought would be obtained via the pen register  and thus, by negative inference, not by means of a separate disclosure of information by the service provider. As the Provider Order specified that government agents would ""install, or cause to be installed"" the pen register, Provider Order at 1, it thus appears that the government contemplated obtaining the requested cell site information by means of the authorized investigative actions of its agents rather than by the actual disclosure of records or information held by any service provider.
B. Procedural History
The government submitted the Application and proposed orders ex parte on August *299 23, 2005. On August 25, 2005, I signed the proposed orders but struck out in each the paragraph directing the service providers to disclose cell site information (and also, in the ""whereas"" clause of the Provider Order, the bracketed reference to ""cell site location authority""). The same day, I issued the August Order to explain the reasons for that outcome.
On September 9, 2005, the government filed a document styled ""Notice of Appeal."" Docket Entry (""DE"") 3. Although the document itself does not specify whether the appeal is being taken to the district judge on miscellaneous duty in this district's Long Island courthouse or to the United States Court of Appeals, the docket entry information that the government provided upon electronically filing the document described it as a ""Notice of Appeal of a Magistrate Judge's Decision to a District Judge (on a mj case)."" DE 3. Later the same day, the government filed a letter-motion asking me to reconsider the August Order. DE 4 (the ""Motion"").

Chances are, every Independent reader has been touched by cancer, whether it is a family member’s diagnosis, a friend’s battle with the disease, or his or her own ordeal. So, it is no surprise that Stow residents are participating in at least two of this year’s teams in the Jimmy Fund Walk, all with their own stories to tell. The Walk takes place this Sunday, September 9, and covers the +26-mile route of the Boston Marathon.

However, participants can choose the length they wish to walk. All proceeds go to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Ellen Sturgis spoke of how her late mother’s experience eventually steered her to raising thousands of dollars for the non-profit Ovarian Cancer Brigade through the Walk. Diagnosed at age 71 with stage 4 ovarian cancer, Chiquita Sturgis did not have much of a chance of fighting the disease, Ellen Sturgis recalled of her mother. “She had been having unassuming kinds of problems. She was having stomach cramps, bloating. That’s what it’s known for; it’s the ‘silent killer’. Even doctors don’t think about it because it’s not as common as breast cancer.” In 1996, almost a year after her diagnosis, Chiquita passed away. Sturgis recollected, “I was left with this idea of how do I know so little about ovarian cancer?”

Last year, Sturgis joined the Walk with the non-profit Ovarian Cancer Brigade. She reported raising $2,500. This year, Sturgis said she is targeting $2,500 as her personal goal, while the group as a whole is already over the $40,000 mark, aiming for $50,000. All of the money raised will be donated to the work of Dr. Ursula Matulonis at Dana Farber, who Sturgis hailed as “a pioneer in gynecological cancer.” Sturgis said she visits Dr. Matulonis up to four times annually to take a look at her research, “And there’s a lot going on. Fourteen years ago it was a death sentence. Now there are different treatments for different types [of ovarian cancer].”

For this year’s walk, Sturgis noted that she will carry as many pictures of her donors with her as possible. “When you get all these people to donate, it makes a huge difference, even if it’s $25.” The Ovarian Cancer Brigade’s donation page is at: http://www.jimmyfundwalk.org/2012/ovariancancerbrigade, along with a link to Sturgis’s donation page.

“Summer of the Traveling Tumor”

The Independent adores a good writer. In her blog chronicling life with cancer, Leah Tepper easily takes that honor, penning lines such as “Keeping Up with the Cancerous” and “The Summer of the Traveling Tumor” (keepingupwiththecancerous.blogspot.com). But talent cannot compensate for what Tepper termed on her blog “the luck of the draw,” with the 19 year old receiving a diagnosis of adrenal cancer more than two years ago. An aggressive and relatively rare disease, the adrenal cancer spread throughout Tepper’s body, requiring several surgeries, chemo rounds, and stretches in the hospital.

Naturally, those who know Tepper often feel helpless, including the Hayes family of Bolton. Maureen Hayes said it was this feeling of helplessness that prompted her son, Matt, to get a “Team Tepper” together for the Jimmy Fund Walk this year. The Hayes’ have been close friends of the Teppers since 22-year-old Matt and Leah’s sister Rachel were in pre-school together, Maureen explained. Through what can only be termed an ordeal for the Teppers as they journey for treatments between Children’s Hospital Boston, Dana Farber — and even adrenal cancer experts at the University of Michigan — Maureen has been coordinating meals and other services for the traveling Teppers. Now, it’s Matt’s turn. Maureen reported he had more than 10 participants line up, with about $5,000 raised thus far. “Matt always says she"
247,3,8404,"Understanding AH

If I have a 110v motor that pulls 156 watts and it runs for 24 hours then it uses 3744 watts (Wx24) right? So that means 34.03 amps (W/V) Right? So without accounting for 50% discharge rules then I would need a 34 AH battery? This is all hypothetical but a way for me to try and rap my head around it. Any thoughts?

Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work -Peter Drucker

The motor probably maxes out around 40% efficiency (there should be specs for it) so your input power will be at least 2.5 times your output power. If the 1 HP rating is maximum power, efficiency at 1 HP is probably closer to 25%. So at 1 HP you’re consuming 4 HP of electricity or about 3KW.

If your battery is a 12V battery then you'll need to deliver 250 A continuously. Add a safety factor (20% is a good idea) to get 300A. So you need a battery that can deliver 300A for as long as you want to run the motor.

I’d use a 96V system to cut the current requirements 8 times, that's still almost 40A/HP delivered.

If your motor is much more efficient that can help a lot, redo the math with your total system efficiency to scale the current.""

110v I assume is AC not DC...

156 Watts is.156 KW and is that at maximum efficiency or at a measured amount? If it's at maximum you'll have to do the math given up there. If you measured it, then take your number. It sounds like your motor is quite small...

At start a motor can load to about double it's running pull, so do take that into account when figuring your battery.

1.42 Amps (figuring your 156 watts is at any moment and an actual measure, divided by the volts). Your battery needs the capacity to deliver the amps as long as you need it to. Again it sounds like a very small motor. And would load to about 3 Amps when starting. So the battery may need to deliver 3 Amps at any one time.

3744 watts would be the total consumption over 24 hours (your words). You don't need to produce 34 amps, you need to produce the working load for as long as the motor is to run. Are you trying to run it on a solar cell with battery backup?

There relevant units are:
Watt (Power): Is the rate at which energy is used, like miles/hour or the amount of wax a candle burns in a certain period of time. This unit describes the energy per time, not the energy itself.
Volt (Voltage | Spannung in german): Is the difference in electric potential. Similar to a difference in height between two volumes of water, or gas pressure. ""The higher the better"", but too high gets dangerous and more difficult to handle.
Ampere (Current): Is the flow rate of electrons. Like gallons/hour.

If you multiply 1 Volt and 1 Ampere, you get 1 Watt. Both parts are needed to produce something useful. The water has to flow and there has to be pressure.

The next ingredient is time. 1 Watt * 1 hour = 1 Wh (Watt-hour). This is a measure of energy. (The amount of wax burned.)

To the actual numbers: 156W = 1.42A * 110V
To get the time the motor will run, multiply 1.42A with the hours it has to run. for 24h * 1.42A = 34Ah.
Now battery manufactures tend to use theoretical numbers, that when actually used, will kill the battery. So the number above has to multiplied with something between 2 and 4.

Motors are usually rated at their maximum capability, so the actual Power drawn by the motor depends on the load and is likely to be below 156W.

As Deb Rebel already pointed out, one major factor is the battery voltage. At 110V the current is 1.42A. At 12V it is 13A. 13A is covered by the normal cables uses for household power.

Are you using an inverter to get the 110V? If so, it will have losses (below 5% for the best ones, otherwise about 20%).

250,12,19160,"What will it take to persuade HM Revenue & Customs to drop the title of “customer relationship managers” from the people it employs to hold the hands of the super rich?

The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has taken yet another potshot at the organisation for not being tough enough on them.

Its latest report voices concern over a growing perception that there is one rule for the rich, and one rule for everyone else when it comes to paying tax.

The fact that those in the former group have their own customer relationship managers only fuels that perception. Throw in that they are paying less tax than a few years ago and rarely seem to face prosecution, and it's not hard to see where that perception comes from.

HMRC has tried to give the impression that it has been taking a tougher line of late. Over Christmas it emerged that it had slapped down a scheme that saw a group of wealthy individuals investing in empty data centres up in the North East with the aim of making a tax profit. The fact that footballers and celebs were involved and were told to pay up, represented a PR win.

But, having investigated HMRC's claims, the PAC, chaired by Labour's Meg Hillier, says they don’t stack up.

Its report says that despite HMRC having set up a special unit to deal with 6,000 or so high net worth individuals in 2009, the amount of income tax they have paid has fallen by £1bn since then. The amount the wider public has coughed up has risen by £23bn over the same time.

The PAC says that a third of all high net worth individuals can find themselves under investigation at any one time, with cases that could be worth up to £1.9bn currently open. And yet, since 2012, HMRC has issued 850 penalties totalling just £9m.

The average penalty works out at £10,500, and as the report points out, that’s hardly going to change the behaviour of multi-millionaires.

For them, it’s little more than a rounding error, and they and their advisors, are getting more devious.

While off the shelf schemes, like the one I mentioned above related to the data centres, have been attacked by HMRC, wealthy individuals, aided and abetted by clever advisors, have simply switched to using tailor made schemes that do much the same thing.

This amounts to their trading in their Primark togs for Saville Row suits, and so doesn’t come cheap. But if it keeps money out of the exchequer, and in their bank accounts, they're not going to worry about some extra fees.

Given the prevalence of such bespoke schemes, its surely time for the advice handed out by HMRC’s customer relationship managers to be recorded, just as it is when you and I contact an HMRC call centre (if we can ever get through).

Football comes in for particularly cutting criticism in the report, as a result of the use by some players and clubs of image rights as a means of cutting tax bills, and it is frankly scandalous that some are still not providing HMRC with data having struck a voluntary agreement with the English Premier League.

251,15,1876,"Dominick Cruz believes there’s nothing Cody Garbrandt can say or do to rattle him ahead of their upcoming UFC bantamweight title clash at UFC 207.

When it comes to psychological warfare, Cruz (22-1 MMA, 5-0 UFC) said it’s all one-way traffic coming from his direction. That’s why his many run-ins with Garbrandt (10-0 MMA, 5-0 UFC) – be it of the verbal or near-physical nature – aren’t going to throw the champion off his game ahead of his second 135-pound title defense. He said the same labels can’t be placed on the challenger, though, which is why, among other things, Cruz has referenced the absence of Garbrandt’s father growing up as well as the many failures of Garbrandt’s teammates when fighting him.

“It’s only personal if you haven’t dealt with it in your own mind,” Cruz told MMAjunkie. “The only difference between me and Cody is I’ve dealt with my demons and he’s still facing them. When he’s in there in the octagon with me he’s got another person to face on top of the demons he’s still already facing in his own personal life. I’m making him battle himself, his own intuition of himself, his own feelings of himself, his feelings about his past, because he refuses to deal with that on his own. He runs from it, and the more he runs from it the more I’m going to make him pay. And the more strength he thinks he has in life, I’m going to take those strengths away and make him deal with his own weaknesses. One of the weaknesses of Cody is his emotions. So, when I say stuff like that it attacks his emotions because he can’t control his emotions. He’s an emotional wreck. I just let him know that.”

Computing the etale cohomology of spheres

$\newcommand\Z{\mathbb{Z}}$
Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\ne 2$. We have the unit sphere $S^n:~x_0^2 + \ldots + x_n^2 = 1$. 
What are the $\Z/2\Z$ cohomology groups of the sphere - $H^i_{et}(S^n,\Z/2\Z)$?
If $K$ is of characteristic 0, then by comparison with the complex numbers we get

256,2,14995,"Pierre-Carl Ouellet fought Bret Hart in a series of matches across the world for three months in 1995.

In front of thousands and thousands of fans each night, he played the part of a bad guy. Ouellet also held the WWF tag-team title three times with his partner in the Quebecers, Jacques Rougeau.

He was Jean-Pierre Lafitte, Killer Carl Wallace and he was The Pirate, a role for which he was a natural given that he has just one eye.

Now 35, Ouellet wrestles in front of hundreds of people one or two times a week in hopes of getting back to the big time.

He's a key guy for CPW International, a group wrestling in Hull every couple of weeks.

He's got reason to be optimistic about his future. He's trimmed down from 280-300 lbs. to a lean, mean fighting machine at 235. And better yet, WWE told him in July they were interested.

Nonetheless, he says he's got enthusiasm for the business no matter how many fans are watching him on a given night.

""This is entertainment, so it doesn't matter if it's 50 people, 500 people or 15,000 people... you've got to perform,"" says Ouellet, who calls Montreal home. ""I still get butterflies before I go out there each night. But that's a good feeling. That's what you need to do your best.""

Ouellet was on his way out of the WWF when he fought Edge in SkyDome in front of huge crowd. He says he's changed so much since then.

""I've got a lot of different moves,"" says Ouellet. ""I'm not the guy who's going to say, 'back then, it was like this.' The business has changed so much. I'm not trying to resist change. I'm changing with the business. I'm doing stuff I wasn't doing five years ago. I'm at the peak of my career.""

Ouellet lost the sight of his right eye when he was 12.

""We were tough kids,"" he recalls. ""I didn't really listen to my parents. We had pellet guns and went to try and kill some birds. We came back and started shooting each other in the legs. We weren't using pellets, we were using Pick Up Stix. I was hiding behind the counter and my friend got me right in the eye. I pulled the stick out and the blood came out big time.""

Months later, he was playing football and there was more bleeding inside the eye. Surgery after surgery followed. Ouellet says it toughened him up.

""I think it helped me at not ever wanting to quit,"" he says. ""It made me mentally tough, a fighter in life.""

A fighter maybe, but a nice guy outside of the ring. A guy who should be back in the spotlight.

- If crashing a limo and nearly killing Kane is your cup of tea, RAW was great. But the show-stopping sequence that had tongues wagging was getting mixed reviews. In case you missed it, Shane McMahon lured Kane into the limo (he entered through the skyroof), then jammed the gas pedal and accelerated the car forward. The car sped into a nearby tractor-trailer, getting its roof ripped off and leaving Kane a bloody mess. It was suggested two cars had been used for the stunt, but WWE officials insisted it was just one.

257,10,7847,"Introduction {#section6-2333721420914785}
============

Disability is a public health issue not only because of its prevalence but also its cost to society. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ([@bibr8-2333721420914785]) estimated that 25% of the U.S. population had some type of disability in 2016. In 2018, 61 million American adults (people aged 18 and above) had difficulty with mobility, independent living, self-care, cognition, hearing, and vision ([@bibr29-2333721420914785]). Overall, disability costs the U.S. government hundreds of billions in dollars spent on disability-related care and services each year ([@bibr24-2333721420914785]). The odds of disability increase with age. The rapid aging of baby-boomers (both native-born and foreign-born) makes examining functional disability among Americans necessary.

There is ample evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality among the aging people ([@bibr5-2333721420914785]; [@bibr18-2333721420914785]; [@bibr25-2333721420914785]; [@bibr33-2333721420914785]; [@bibr41-2333721420914785]; [@bibr42-2333721420914785]). Significant racial/ethnic disparities also exist in the prevalence of functional disability among older native-born Americans ([@bibr12-2333721420914785]; [@bibr19-2333721420914785]; [@bibr23-2333721420914785]; [@bibr32-2333721420914785]). Morbidity is related to functional disability as demonstrated by some researchers. For example, [@bibr4-2333721420914785] show that some morbidity conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) may be precursors of disability. [@bibr31-2333721420914785] similarly observed higher levels of disability ""among people diagnosed with chronic morbidities"" (p. 4).

One social determinant of research interest in relation to morbidity and mortality is immigrant history and the health advantage of immigrants over native-born people ([@bibr2-2333721420914785]; [@bibr14-2333721420914785]; [@bibr37-2333721420914785]; [@bibr38-2333721420914785]). This interest arises because the baby-boom population is racially and ethnically diverse and includes a significant number of foreign-born boomers ([@bibr10-2333721420914785]; [@bibr17-2333721420914785]). The upsurge in the number of immigrants to the United States has also introduced increased diversity among the foreign-born population not only culturally but also socioeconomically ([@bibr1-2333721420914785]). Functional disability and socioeconomic status are related. For example, it is known that socioeconomic status decreases as disabilities increase in number ([@bibr39-2333721420914785]). It is therefore important to understand the prevalence of functional disability conditions among immigrants relative to native-born Americans.

Studies of racial and ethnic disparities in functional disability among immigrants in the United States have examined the healthy immigrant hypothesis and the erosion of this effect with duration of U.S. residency ([@"
258,5,3151,"The Vikings prepare to return to Paris; Yidu reveals her heritage to Ragnar; Lagertha fulfills a major promise. Photo stills and recap of “Promised”, which aired Thursday, March 17 at 10:00pm ET|PT on HISTORY.

***SPOILER ALERT***

“Promised” opened up in Hedeby with Viking soldiers and shieldmaidens preparing for their next raid of Paris. Erlendur had some target practice in the forest with his modified crossbow; Kalf and others were impressed with the weapon’s increased range. Separately, Kalf and Erlendur speculated that Bjorn must have killed the berserker (which was true). But for Erlendur, it didn’t matter. He believed they now had a spy in Ragnar’s household who would share with them the Lothbroks’ weaknesses and the best time to strike—Torvi. Why was Erlendur so sure Torvi would betray Bjorn? Because if she didn’t Erlendur would kill their son. But what of Lagertha?

In a separate conversation, Kalf tried to convince Lagertha that Erlendur had forgiven Torvi for leaving, but Lagertha didn’t seem convinced. But that was the least of their concerns because Lagertha had a surprise–she was pregnant. (WHATTTT?!) Both Kalf and Lagertha were happy… Kalf even proposed. Though Lagertha smiled, she didn’t give him a response.

In Kattegat, Ragnar and Bjorn were also preparing for the raids. As they worked on the ships, Ragnar and Bjorn expressed his distrust of King Harald Finehair from Tamdrup (who would be joining their journey to Paris). Ragnar changed the conversation to ask why Bjorn refused to care for Little Siggy. Bjorn said that he did care about his daughter, but that she reminded him of things he’d rather forget (probably Porunn 🙁 ). Ragnar also seemed displeased about Bjorn separating Torvi from her son:R: “And what kind of man takes a mother away from"
259,8,1006,"Q:

One repo or separate repos?

My organization is starting up an automation team, and we are still working on our structures and procedures.
We are using Git to store automation code, and we seem to be of two minds; some feel we should put all our automation code in one repo, and others feel we should separate code into multiple repos.
Here's the wrinkles: Much of the automation we will write is not for AUTs. It is for mission-critical third-party software, the actions of which may induce certain internally designed processes to do certain things. Most of these are integration layers between diverse third party applications. The overall software ecosystem is very large with diverse and mostly third-party applications.  As a result, there won't be hardly any shared code between the frameworks for each application.
So far the best argument for single-repository design is that we can run all tests at once from one repo. There is no scenario, though, where we would run all tests at once.
I am proposing separate repos for each application we will automate, with an additional ""common"" repository for whatever few things we can share.
Also, there will be 6 automation developers, most of the time each will be the only one working on a particular application, for the small ones; but for the larger applications, there will likely be two or more working on it.
Do you agree with my camp of having separate repos? Can you give me pros and cons?

A:

It depends. 
Right now you might not see much need for a single repository design. Later, you may find your opinion changes. 
You might want to use a single repository if

you need to keep your different projects in sync. It's more difficult to keep separate repositories in sync than a single repository. 
your team members will need to switch between projects, particularly if they are having to regularly switch. The cost of switching project is significant enough without adding the need to make sure the correct source bindings follow. 
you need to be able to view quickly retrieve the a branch of all the projects. This is much easier when you have one repository than when you need to get latest for multiple repositories.
you need to keep your branches in sync. It's a lot more complex maintaining a consistent branching policy when you're managing multiple repositories.

You might want to use multiple repositories if

you don't and will not ever need to re-use code from one repository in a different repository.
each team member is going to spend most of their time with one repository
you have no need to use a centralized continuous build/continuous deployment process (and you don't foresee one) OR you are able to create a separate continuous build/deployment environment for each project.
your separate projects use incompatible languages/development environments/life cycles.
you can completely sandbox and isolate each project.

What it will probably come down to is which strategy most of your team members can work with. It is probably easier to start with a single repository and split out new repositories at need than to move in the other direction, but there really aren't many significant issues in either direction. All the factors I've listed are primarily conveniences.

A:

Running all tests at once is something that a Continuous Integration server should do for you, not something you do manual as it lets you wait for a long time. Let a server do the work and reporting.
Multiple repo's have the following advantages:

Easier to schedule parallel-runs in a CI. Will be faster. (technically also possible with a single repo, but harder)
Smaller, thus faster to work in with most IDE's (because they scan all the files often)
Possible to version against the common library repo. This needs some more explaining. With a single repository you need to update all the applications if you update the common shared code. If you for example have an application tested that doesn't need updating anymore ever you could use an older version of the shared code, but if you have one repository you need to update all the code to use the new changes to the common shared code. (I think this one might be important for you, as it"
260,18,14377,"As the Norwegian Pearl sailed on past the coast of Cuba on its way to Jamaica, Jam Cruse 15 saw its first full day of music aboard the ship, with an eclectic offering of genres, sit ins and collaborations for day two.

The music got started with San Francisco bluegrass outfit The Brothers Comatose, who took to the Pool Deck stage in the early afternoon sun for an upbeat set that featured a cover of the Grateful Dead’s “Brokedown Palace” and closed out with an energetic guest spot from lap steel master Roosevelt Collier.

Next up on the deck was a set from classic jamband mainstays Percy Hill, whose jazzy set was punctuated by a mini-Women’s March around the Pool Deck, a show of solidarity with the events happening in Washington DC and in several cities around the United States on Saturday.

Inside, a New Orleans bass battle for the ages was taking place between George Porter Jr. and Tony Hall of Dumpstaphunk, introduced as “a legend and his protege,” while Nathan Moore played a small set in the main atrium that featured keyboardist Marco Benevento and a nod to the duo’s days in their band Surprise Me Mr. Davis.

Back on the Pool Deck, Ivan Neville and Cris Jacobs’ Neville Jacobs project delivered a genre-spanning set of funk, blues and more that featured help from Turkuaz’s Shira Elias, plus sit ins from Cyril Neville on the Grateful Dead’s “Fire On the Mountain” and the Shady Horns’ Ryan Zoidis and Benny Bloom for Peter Gabriel’s “Sledgehammer,” plus a cover of Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth.” Inside the ship, Love Canon was offering up their brand of ‘80s classics with a bluegrass flavor.



As the sun dipped behind the Cuban coastline, Kamasi Washington and his band delivered their second set of the cruise on the Pool Deck, once again welcoming out Rickey Washington and improvising on originals and other tunes like the jazz standard “Cherokee,” led by vocalist Patrice Quinn. Immediately after, Motet keyboardist Joey Porter then played an intimate set in Bar City that featured several guests including bandmate and vocalist Lyle Divinsky and Turkuaz’s Sammi Garett and Shira Elias.



At the same time, word came down over the ship’s speaker system that, due to weather, the cruise would not be making its scheduled stop on Monday at Grand Cayman Island. Instead, Jam Cruise 15 will get an additional day at sea, which will feature a Grateful at Sea collaboration with Steve Kimock, Reed Mathis, Dan “Lebo” Lebowitz, Jay Lane and more special guests, plus impromptu jams around the ship.

It\'s because that LDLC particles have been linked to atheroma formation, and on the other hand, HDLC can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma and offer protection to the disease. So, LDLC is sometimes referred to as \""bad cholesterol\"" and HDLC \""good cholesterol\"". As a result, protamine and COS mixtures decreased the potential risks of cardiovascular diseases by lowering values of the AI and CRF, which are represented in terms of T-CHO and HDLC levels in serum. A future study is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the improvement effect on cholesterol levels by protamine and COS.

In conclusion, the mixtures of protamine and COS effectively reduced the serum TG, T-CHO, and LDLC levels rapidly increased by high fat diets, and enhanced the serum HDLC level. In addition, these mixtures promoted the excretion of dietary lipids by blocking digestion, absorption, and accumulation in the body through their inhibition effect on the pancreatic lipase. With these alterations in lipid metabolism, we suggest the mixtures of protamine and COS as a prominent dietary therapy for the prevention of overweight, obesity, and further cardiovascular diseases related with hyperlipidemia.

262,1,25584," voluntary HIV testing for all pregnant women is not currently being met in Wisconsin.

Ischemic preconditioning is a physiologic phenomenon that occurs in the cardiac muscle in which brief episodes of ischemia protect the heart when exposed to a sustained ischemia. Clinical counterparts include potential benefits of preinfarction angina and less ischemia after a second, compared to a first, coronary angioplasty balloon inflation. This article will discuss how preconditioning might be applied to the clinical setting during acute myocardial infarction, coronary interventions, and cardiac surgery.

Background: Reimbursement obstacles, such as inadequate insurance coverage, have been identified as barriers to adequate pain management. The purpose of this study was to determine Wisconsin insurers’ and managed care organizations’ (MCOs) policies and practices regarding pain treatment and MCO medical directors’ perceptions of barriers to providing effective pain management for their enrollees.

Methods: A descriptive qualitative design was used with semi-structured interviews of 6 administrative executives of commercial health management organizations’ products from the major insurers in Wisconsin.

Results: None of the companies interviewed had systematically tracked data or had processes in place to allow them to track, analyze or trend data specific to pain management. Chronic noncancer pain is recognized more frequently as an insurance coverage issue because of high drug costs. Pharmacologic and interventional therapies are routinely covered compared with nonpharmacologic therapies with some prior authorizations, especially for newer medications. A uniformly identified barrier was lack of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, integrated approach to pain management and inadequate data on the cost effectiveness of various approaches.

Conclusions: Opportunities exist to educate and improve communication between health care professionals, purchasers of health care (employers), primary care providers and pain specialists. The economics of pain management needs to be made more “visible” through the development of coding and tracking mechanisms.

265,6,18801,"Julie Speed

Julie Speed (born 1951, Chicago, Illinois) is an American artist. After dropping out of Rhode Island School of Design at age 19, Speed spent her twenties moving around the U.S. and Canada working pickup jobs (house painter, horse trainer, ad writer, farm worker, etc.) until moving to Texas in 1978, where she settled down and taught herself to paint. She switches back and forth regularly between oil painting, printmaking, collage, gouache and drawing, often combining disciplines. Two large volumes of her work, Julie Speed, Paintings, Constructions and Works on Paper, 2004 and Speed, Art 2003-2009 have been published by the University of Texas. She lives and works in Marfa, Texas. In her words, “I keep hours just like a real job, only longer, and in my spare time I read books, drink tequila, and garden.”

Style and technique 

Speed paints surreal scenes in a realistic style with oil and gouache. Her collages incorporate scientific illustrations and architectural drawings.
In collaboration with her husband Fran Christina, and Flatbed Press in Austin, Texas, she creates limited edition etchings.

""Speed’s work has been described as surrealist, hallucinogenic, iconoclastic and absurdist. Her detailed microorganism paintings, such as Blue or Metamporphoses, bring to mind the intricate scientific prints of Ernst Haeckel. The disquiet of her portraits, particularly the Hostage and Jawbone series, evoke the unflinching pathos of Otto Dix. Her continued reference to Renaissance themes and images combine the allegory of Bosch and Bruegel with the flatness usually found in Mexican primitivism. And yet, none of these influences begin to encapsulate the strangeness of Speed’s work. Speed’s unique vision is most pronounced in collage, although this term is inadequate to fully describe her compositions, which combine etching, gouache, mixed media, ink, and found paper. The animating spirit of her work lies in the spirit of collage — even her paintings seem to stem from some incongruous “other” place, a hidden layer hovering imperceptibly in the background, immediately jarring the viewer. “

is an arcade game by Data East released in 1991 and was later ported to the Nintendo Game Boy.

Gameplay 
The game involves one or two ghostbusters who can suck monsters, ghosts, aliens and various other oddball characters into vacuum-cleaner-like devices and spit them back as bouncing/rolling balls. Expelled enemies function as projectiles that can damage and kill other opponents on the screen when colliding with them. The game's looks are reminiscent of Pang. Throughout the game, the player/s can collect letters of the alphabet found in randomly appearing bubbles in order to gradually spell the word ""TUMBLEPOP"", the progress of which is permanently displayed at the bottom of the screen. When completed, players are transported to a bonus level which gives them the opportunity to obtain higher scores and an extra life, although this level is strictly timed. The word goes back to default after completion.

In the original arcade version, the protagonists work their way through stages set in different parts of the world, each with their own enemies and at least one boss, as listed below:

Moscow, which is a circus-like stage, enemies being clowns, invisible conjurers, and fire spitters; the boss is a giant clown held by balloons who juggles with bombs.
Egypt: near the pyramids in the desert, the enemies include fire spitters and mummies; the boss is a giant genie appearing from a lamp who spits fireballs.
Paris: near the Arch of Triumph, all the enemies are robots; the boss is a giant flying robot that sends out flying hands.
New York City: near the Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Center, the enemies are pumpkin-headed zombies and octopuses; the boss is a giant octopus who appears from the sea.
Rio de Janeiro: near the Statue of Christ the Redeemer, with several fire monsters; the boss is a dragon made out of fire.
Antarctica: populated by snowmen, snowmen armed with shovels, and hairy monsters; the boss is a giant snowman wearing a bucket on its head. 
Australia; it has carnivorous plants, cavemen and snowmen made out of mud; the boss is a giant two-headed carnivorous plant.
Japan: near Mount Fuji with yureis, kappas and skeletons; the boss is a giant pile of daruma dolls.
Space: Greys and spacemen with blaster guns. The boss is a flying robot that looks like the Flatwoods monster.
Moon: all the bosses from the previous worlds must be fought again. The final boss is a cyborg mad scientist controlling a giant robot.

The player/s has/have to complete every level within a specific period of time before exceeding an invisible timer. If the players do not manage to eliminate all the monsters in time, a Dracula-like beast appears and approaches them with a sinister laugh. If the beast manages to touch a player before he/she eliminates all the monsters, the player suffers an instant loss of a life. This also counts in the Boss levels.

Version differences 
The Game Boy version incorporates a world map that doesn't resemble Earth; levels are contained in different cities on that map that the player can walk between (similar to the style of the world map in Commander Keen).

269,28,11058,"How much is the EPA and DOT costing you?

One way to quantify this is to consider a car GM builds – but which you can’t buy. Well, not unless you move outside the United States – and beyond the diktats and fatwas of the EPA and DOT.

It is called the Sail – and GM makes it in China. It retails for 60,000 yuan – equivalent to about $9,800 in “federal” reserve notes.

Demand for the car is so great that GM plans to increase its exports of the Sail to countries like Chile and Ecuador by nearly 70 percent, according to a recent Reuters article (see here).

It just won’t be exported here.

And why?

Those two federal agencies mentioned at the beginning of this story. These unelected and unaccountable bureaucracies have made it illegal – a criminal offense – to sell you a car like the Sail. Which, by the way, is neither primitive nor pathetic. The most recent design is a modern and aesthetically appealing sedan or five-door hatchback wagon with a Corvette-inspired “dual cockpit” dash layout. The car has AC, power windows, power door mirrors and a modern stereo with Bluetooth wireless and music streaming. It even has a leather-wrapped steering wheel.

It would look at home on any road – and in any garage – in the Western world.

But what really sets the car apart is what’s under its hood. There, you would (if you could buy the Sail) find a high-efficiency 1.4 liter, 101 hp engine or (if you were allowed to choose) 1.2 liter, 85-hp engine that averages 41.2 MPG – easily meeting the 35.5 MPG fuel economy fatwa issued by the Feds, which goes into effect just two model years from now (2016). There is also a 1.3 liter turbo-diesel engine (Fiat-sourced!) on the roster of options.

It does even better.

Imagine that: A 40 MPG-plus car that costs less than $10,000 and which isn’t a flimsy/shoddy latter-day Yugo, either. It’s not the quickest thing on wheels – depending on the engine, zero to 60 takes 12-15 seconds – but it’s certainly adequate for A to B commuting and general knocking around. It’s only slightly less quick than a Prius C, hybrid – which takes about 11.3 seconds to get to 60 (and costs almost $20,000).

Unfortunately (for American car buyers) the Sail does not pass muster with current EPA emissions and DOT safety requirements.

Hence, it cannot be sold here.

But it is neither “unsafe” – nor “dirty.”

The Sail would probably meet the EPA/DOT standards in effect circa 1990 – by which time new cars were so “clean” that only about 5 percent of what came out of the tailpipe was other than water vapor and carbon dioxide (an inert gas that has nothing to do with the formation of smog). Since that time, the EPA has pursued a policy of diminishing returns by insisting that the remaining 5 percent of the exhaust stream that’s not water vapor and C02 be “controlled.” Instead of a $200 catalytic converter, a $70 oxygen sensor and a $500 throttle body fuel injection system – which cleaned up 90 percent of the exhaust – it’s $500 a piece for for multiple close-coupled cats, $2,000 for direct gas injection (and so on) to get a 1 percent (if that) additional reduction.

But that’"

271,29,28594," to obtain a very lump some [sic] of a life insurance,"" advising the sentencing judge in one of the letters that he was the ""key witness"" and informing him in the other that he had just testified. In both letters he mentioned again Officer Massey.
The sentencing judge responded to S. Williams on two occasions, sending copies to ""the State's Attorney's Office,"" rather than to a particular assistant. In one of the responses, the judge told S. Williams to have his attorney contact the detective who registered him ""and [to] have [his] attorney or the Detective contact this office to inform the Judge of any help you are giving him.""
Having learned of the preceding facts, the respondent filed a post conviction petition, based on newly discovered evidence. The newly discovered evidence was, he alleged, that the State had failed to disclose impeachment information regarding S. Williams, its primary and star witness, including that he was, and had a record of being, a paid informant. The respondent argued that without this information, his cross-examination of the ""jailhouse snitch"" at trial was severely and prejudicially weakened.
As indicated, the prosecuting attorney testified that she had not made any ""offers of leniencies or provided any benefit to Sean Williams in exchange for his testimony in the Tony Williams case."" Moreover, she denied speaking with the prosecutor who prosecuted S. Williams and, therefore, was aware neither of the charges lodged against him nor of their disposition.
The post conviction court denied the respondent's petition for post conviction *978 relief. Perceiving the question to be whether the knowledge possessed by a prosecutor in the General Felony Division of the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office is imputed to a homicide prosecutor in the same office, but in a different location and a different division, it answered ""no,"" concluding that ""under Brady and Maryland Rule 4-263(g), the State's duty did not extend to information held by another prosecutor within the same prosecutor's office who, at all times, was wholly unconnected to the case at issue."" The court reasoned that, while it ""seems fair and appropriate for the State to be required to disclose to defense counsel all exculpatory information in its hands, including all evidence which goes toward impeachment of a State witness, both in its files and the files of the police and of all other agencies who have reported on the case to the State's Attorney's Office and who have participated in the case as a part of the prosecution case,"" a rule that would extend the disclosure duty on the prosecution to information possessed by those who neither has ever reported to the prosecution or directly worked on the case would be too broad. ""Th[e] Court d[id] not believe such construction would be appropriate, practical or would enhance the administration of justice.""

B.
At the Court of Special Appeals, the respondent conceded that the particular Assistant State's Attorney in his case had not been aware of S. Williams's status as an informant. The respondent contended, however, that, under Brady, the obligation to disclose information relating to the credibility of a witness extended beyond the knowledge of the particular prosecutor, to all of that prosecutor's colleagues within the same office. Further, the respondent argued that Maryland Rule 4-263(g) applies to all prosecutors in the same office, whether or not assigned to, or working on, the case. Thus, the respondent argued that, because S. Williams was the State's critical witness, ""[the State] should at the very least be required to perform due diligence within the same prosecutor's office to verify such claims."" Williams v. State, 152 Md.App. at 218, 831 A.2d at 511. Finally, the respondent maintained that S. Williams's testimony was material. He noted, in support, the lack of forensic evidence and the circumstantial nature of the rest of the State's case. He believed, and therefore submitted, that there was a reasonable probability[4] that the verdict would have been different if S. Williams's status as an informant had been disclosed.
*979 The State, not unexpectedly, agreed with the post conviction court's more limited reading of Brady and Maryland Rule 4-263(g). The State further contended that S. Williams's information was not material since his credibility was sufficiently ""attacked"" on cross-examination.
In deciding this case, the Court of Special Appeals first established that, pursuant to Giglio, when the reliability of a State witness is determinative of the defendant's guilt or innocence, the State's failure to disclose impeachment evidence falls within Brady. 405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. at 766, 31 L.Ed.2d at 108. It agreed with the respondent that when applied to his case, Giglio, required that ""[t]he prosecutor's office [be treated"

The membranes and tubes were stored at −75°C or lower prior to nucleic acid extraction. The total DNA and RNA were extracted from the samples using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH) as previously described ([@B23]). The RNA was further purified using the Ambion TURBO DNA-free DNase kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and then complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the random hexamer primed Superscript III system for RT-PCR (Life Technologies). The total RNA was stored at −75°C or lower, while the cDNA and the DNA extracts were stored at −20°C until use.

The gene copy numbers of *Enterococcus* spp. and *Vibrio* spp. in the samples (including extraction and filtration blanks) were measured from cDNA and DNA extracts, and the *Vibrio cholerae* and Gram-negative bacteria gene copy numbers were measured from the DNA extract only. The qPCR assays were performed as previously described ([@B23]), by processing 8 μl of RNA in a cDNA synthesis (reverse transcription, RT). The primers and probes used in this study are listed in the [Table S1](#SM1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}. The targeted genes were 23S rRNA gene for *Enterococcus* spp. \[Entero1 assay; ([@B24])\] 16S rRNA gene for *Vibrio* spp. ([@B25]), and the *ompW* gene was used for the *V. cholerae* ([@B26], [@B27]). Total bacterial numbers in the BS and BSM waters were evaluated by using an assay targeted to 16S rRNA gene of all Gram -negative bacteria ([@B28]). The qPCR reactions were performed using a QuantStudio 6 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) in 20 μl volume using the TaqMan Environmental PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies) for *Enterococcus* spp., *V. cholerae* and Gram- assays and the Power Sybr PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies) for a *Vibrio* spp. assay, all with primers and probes at final concentrations 0.2 μM (IDT Technologies, Inc). The cycling conditions included 95°C for 10 min of enzyme activation and pre-denaturation followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s of denaturation and at 60°C for 60 s of annealing, except for *Vibrio* spp., for which a 64°C annealing temperature was used and a melt curve analysis of the PCR amplicons was performed. Standard curves were generated using artificial gene fragments (gBlocks, IDT Technologies, Inc.) containing the sequences for each of the targeted genes.

In lower extremities, PET scan was carried out with acquirement of 6-7 bed positions with 2-3 minutes of acquisition time per position from upper thigh-to-feet.

**Image Analysis**

PET/CT images were visually and semiquantitatively assessed by an experienced nuclear medicine physician. The reconstructed images were visually assessed in the standard axial, coronal, and sagittal views. The accumulation of FDG outside the physiological uptake areas was considered pathological. For semiquantitative analysis, a region of interest was carefully drawn around the site of increased FDG uptake on the subsequent 4--10 PET scan slices and the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the lesions were calculated and used for this analysis. The SUV was calculated using the following formula: SUV=Tissue concentration (Bq/g)/\[Injected dose (Bq)/Body weight (g)\].

The prognosis of the disease was followed-up for 3 months after the PET/CT study by conventional diagnostic examinations and procedures. Diagnosis of patients with detected pathologies was conducted by localized detailed imaging methods, biopsies, and other invasive procedures or clinical observation aimed at the pathological findings, whereas secondary evaluations and clinical examinations were employed in other patients.

FDG PET/CT was considered to help FUO diagnosis (true positive) in cases where the pathological foci shown by PET/CT displayed consistency with the definitive diagnosis of the patients. Scans which have shown foci that were not consistent with the diagnoses (false positive), and scans where PET/CT showed no pathological foci despite determination of a foci by other methods or during the clinical follow-up (false negative) were considered to be unhelpful for the diagnosis. In cases where PET/CT was negative and no pathological focus could be determined, the result was considered as true negative.

**Statistical Analysis**

Conventional methods were used to generate descriptive statistics and sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were calculated based on their standard definitions.

Data on demographic characteristics of the patients, duration of fever, imaging studies prior to PET/CT, nonphysiological uptakes detected with PET/CT, established definitive diagnosis, and contribution of PET/CT to diagnosis, are given in Table 1.

Pathological findings were detected by FDG PET/CT in 19 (79.2%) of 24 patients with FUO. The definitive diagnosis found to be consistent with the foci indicative of pathological uptakes determined by FDG PET/CT in 12 (63.2%) of 19 patients. Neoplasms were determined to be the underlying cause of FUO in 5 (41.6%) of 12 patients with definitive diagnosis ([Figure1](#f1){ref-type=""fig""}).

What exactly is WWF? The mission of the self-described “conservation organization” is so nebulous that it is not even entirely clear for what words the acronym stands. Back in 1961, when WWF was founded as a private initiative, the initials stood for “World Wildlife Fund.” These are undoubtedly the words that most Americans at least still associate with them. In the meanwhile, however — since WWF began, as its online FAQ explains, “expand[ing] its work to conserve the environment as a whole (reflecting the interdependence of all living things)” — the official name of the organization has been changed to “WWF-World Wide Fund For Nature.” “More and more, however,” the FAQ entry continues tautologically, “ … WWF is known as simply ‘WWF’” — i.e. who cares what it stands for!

What we do know, however, is that WWF has in recent years been one of the principal purveyors of climate alarmism. It would seem that the organization has still further expanded its brief to cover the conservation not only of “all living things,” but even of that non-living and, frankly, purely notional thing known as “climate.” It was thus WWF that served as the cited source for the IPCC’s now famously debunked claim, according to which at current rates of “warming” the Himalayan glaciers could be expected to melt by 2035. Indeed, Debbie Framboise has turned up dozens of citations of WWF in the IPCC’s 2007 “Fourth Assessment Report,” on everything from “mudflows and avalanches” to the allegedly destructive effects of climate change on “marine fish and shellfish.” Richard North of the EUReferendum blog has uncovered yet another dodgy WWF-referenced claim on the alleged effects of climate change on the Amazonian forests.

That the IPCC’s assessment would rely so heavily on the claims of an activist organization raises obvious questions about its objectivity. But the issues raised by the IPCC’s reliance on WWF are even more troubling than might appear on first glance. For exactly what sort of activist organization is WWF? It is commonly"

Hakodate
It took Commodore Perry and American gunboat diplomacy to open Japan to the outside world after two centuries of self-imposed isolation. In 1859, the port of Hakodate became the first Japanese city fully opened to Westerners under the Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Foreigners soon flocked to Hakodate, and today visitors wandering the cobblestone streets of the city's Motomachi District can view their Western-style frame houses. Hakodate, once a fishing port famed for its high quality fish and shellfish, quickly became Hokkaido's largest city and one of Japan's most important ports. The Great Hakodate Fire of 1934 dealt the city a near fatal blow - a blow from which Hakodate was slow to recover. Today the city is Hokkaido's third largest - surpassed by Sapporo and Asahikawa - but retains its foremost position as the finest Japanese producer of sushi's raw product: the high quality seafood caught in Hokkaido's cold waters.

A Pre-Order Bonus I Can Get Behind

From the moment Dishonored 2 was announced, it became my most anticipated game of 2016; I pre-ordered the collector’s edition as soon as it was available.

Last week Bethesda made waves when they announced they would no longer be sending out early review copies to media outlets. While I may not agree with that practice, this is definitely a game I’m ready to experience without reading a review first.

As if to reward me for that, I received a delightful email from Amazon today, letting me know that not only will my copy of Dishonored 2 arrive on time, it will actually arrive a day early.

Hooray for me!

Of all the pre-order bonuses I’ve been privy to, this is one of the best. I know early adopters sometimes get burned and become unintentional playtesters, but I love getting in there at the onset and seeing the game as soon as I can. Add to this my"

They also make no claim to an undivided one-half interest in the mother's estate which Leslie received as an heir of the mother, same being a one-sixth interest of the whole. The total interest to which they make no claim amounts to five-sixths of the real and personal property of the father's estate. It is not questioned that by the agreement and quit claim deed Everett and his wife conveyed all the right, title and interest he had to the real and personal property owned by Emery W. Sterling, the father, at the time of his death. However, Everett claims he is entitled to one-half of her property or one-sixth of all the real and personal property in the father's *144 estate. It is his contention that the parts of the agreement and quit claim deed which seek to convey his prospective interest in the property of Margaret Sterling at the time of her death were void and ineffective inasmuch as it was unconscionable, procured by fraud, in violation of a confidential relationship and based on inadequate or no consideration.
I. In regard to the final report of Leslie Sterling as administrator of his mother's estate it is shown he made all necessary reports and took all necessary actions in connection with the administration of the estate. From a review of all matters presented concerning it we are satisfied the administrator has sustained the burden of proof regarding his report as required by our holdings. In re Estate of Rinard, 224 Iowa 100, 106, 275 N.W. 485 and cases cited; In re Guardianship of Morris, 228 Iowa 646, 649, 292 N.W. 836.
It must be kept in mind Everett and his wife, in their objections to the final report and in their defenses in the quiet title action, made certain affirmative allegations. They have the burden of sustaining their claims of fraud, inadequacy of consideration, lack of good faith, and existence of a confidential relationship. In re Estate of Lundvall, 242 Iowa 430, 435, 436, 46 N.W.2d 535.
As previously noted there was a meeting on February 24, 1941, at the home of J. A. Breon where in addition to Breon there were Everett, his wife and Leslie. It is Everett's claim there was no discussion concerning his possible interest in the estate of his mother. In connection with this contention it is of interest and of particular import in this case to note in the testimony of Breon he quoted Everett's wife as stating regarding her husband's anticipated interest in the mother's estate: ""She said they would never get any of it anyhow because his mother would give it all to Leslie"". This attributed statement was not denied by Everett when he was a later witness. Everett's wife was never called as a witness and consequently did not deny the statement. It thus is affirmatively shown there was a discussion of Everett's possible interest in his mother's estate. We are unable to find and hold there was any fraud and misrepresentation on the part of Leslie or Breon in regard to the transfer of the possible interest in Margaret Sterling's later estate."

287,2,28702,"Armand Philippon

Armand Philippon (27 August 1761 – 4 May 1836), sometimes called Phillipon, was a French soldier during the French Revolution and the subsequent First French Empire.

Despite enlisting in the army as a private soldier, Philippon rose to the rank of Général de Division during the Peninsular War, and was created Baron in 1809.  He was Governor of Badajoz between 1811 and 1812, when he was captured by the British following the Battle of Badajoz.  After his capture, Philippon was taken to the UK, but he broke his parole and returned to France and the Grande Armée before retiring from military service on 15 January 1814.

Biography 

Philippon was born in Rouen on 27 August 1761, and enlisted as a soldier in the Regiment of Lorraine on 15 April 1778.  He was promoted to Corporal on 16 April 1785, Sergeant in November 1786 and Sergeant Major on 15 April 1790.  He received his commission on 9 August 1792, when he was named Captain in the 7th battalion of Bec-d'Ambès.  He spent 1792–93 campaigning with the Armée du Nord, under the command of Generals Joseph Servan and Léonard Muller, before joining the Armée des Pyrénées occidentales under General Moncey.  While serving on the Spanish border, Philippon distinguished himself by capturing a fort at Irursum, defended by 2,500 Spanish troops, with only 600 men.  This act of bravery resulted in Philippon's promotion to Adjutant-General and provisional Chef de brigade.

Philippon was transferred to the Army of the West in Year IV (1795–1796), then posted to the Army of the Danube in Year VII (1798–1799) where he was given command of the 87th demi-Brigade.  The years IX–XI (1800–1803) were spent campaigning in Grisons, Valais, Switzerland and Italy, and in October 1803 he became Colonel of the 54th Line regiment.

After moving to the French Army of Hanover, Philippon was made a member of the Légion d'honneur on 19 Frimaire Year XII (November 1803) and an officer of that order on 25 Prairial (14 June 1804).  He served in Spain during the Peninsular War from 1808, was created a baron in 1809, and saw action with General Pierre Lapisse's division of Marshal Victor's I Corps at the Battle of Talavera and the Siege of Cádiz.  Philippon's conduct at Cádiz resulted in his promotion to Brigadier General (Général de Brigade) on 25 June 1810.

Philippon took part in Marshal Soult's expedition into Extremadura in 1811, and distinguished himself again at the Battle of the Gebora.  Following the capture by the French of the important fortress town of Badajoz after the first siege of Badajoz, Philippon was named Governor of the town on 11 March 1811, and he made his name defending the fortress through the second siege.  While Sir William Beresford, the commander of the Allied Anglo–Spanish–Portuguese corps besieging Badajoz, was defending against Soult's attempt to relieve the siege at the Battle of Albuera, Philippon led a sally from Badajoz and destroyed much of the abandoned siege-works, and continued to offer resistance to Allies until the siege was lifted on 20 June.

In recognition of his defence of Badajoz, Philippon was promoted to Major General (Général de Division) on 9 July 1811, and he remained in command of the fortress's garrison.  When the Allies returned to lay siege to the town in"

290,15,22127,"The U.S. Departments of Justice and Education released joint guidance today to help provide educators the information they need to ensure that all students, including transgender students, can attend school in an environment free from discrimination based on sex.

Recently, questions have arisen from school districts, colleges and universities, and others about transgender students and how to best ensure these students, and non-transgender students, can all enjoy a safe and discrimination-free environment.

Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools receiving federal money may not discriminate based on a student’s sex, including a student’s transgender status. The guidance makes clear that both federal agencies treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of enforcing Title IX.

“There is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex,” said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. “This guidance gives administrators, teachers and parents the tools they need to protect transgender students from peer harassment and to identify and address unjust school policies. I look forward to continuing our work with the Department of Education – and with schools across the country – to create classroom environments that are safe, nurturing, and inclusive for all of our young people.”

“No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,” said U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. “This guidance further clarifies what we’ve said repeatedly – that gender identity is protected under Title IX. Educators want to do the right thing for students, and many have reached out to us for guidance on how to follow the law. We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from, they have the opportunity to get a great education in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and violence.”

“Every child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow. And we know that teachers and administrators care deeply about all of their students and want them to succeed in school and life,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Our guidance sends a clear message to transgender students across the country: here in America, you are safe, you are protected and you belong – just as you are. We look forward to working with school officials to make the promise of equal opportunity a reality for all of our children.”

“Our federal civil rights law guarantees all students, including transgender students, the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities without sex discrimination as a core civil right,” said Department of Education Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “This guidance answers questions schools have been asking, with a goal to ensure that all students are treated equally consistent with their gender identity. We look forward to continuing to work with schools and school communities to satisfy Congress’ promise of equality for all.”

The guidance explains that when students or their parents, as appropriate, notify a school that a student is transgender, the school must treat the student consistent"

bring things right, and at all events will console him.""

Thus Ellen had not any information to afford Mrs. Gordon Frere, when
she surprised her by a visit that same afternoon. It was Hester who
repeated to Ellen the particulars which Lady Henmarsh had extracted
from the footman that morning, and Hester who suggested that Robert
might find it more difficult than he imagined to open any
communication with his wife.

""Lady Henmarsh went to Mr. Guyon's solicitor,"" said Hester; ""and he
evidently can tell nothing. Mrs. Streightley had a long interview with
him after her father's death, but he declares she never gave him a
hint of her intention, and was singularly quiet and composed. He
wondered, indeed, at the composure with which she bore her father's
death. I believe Mr. Streightley expects her to communicate with him,
or you, or some one, by letter?""

""I suppose so. O, of course,"" said Ellen; ""but the whole thing
bewilders me. What fault can she have to find with Robert? Surely no
woman ever had a better husband.""

Mrs. Frere assented to this proposition, and the two talked over the
mysterious occurrence. With none the less _goût_ that no amount of
talking could render it less mysterious. Hester had a certain degree
of knowledge, and a greater degree of suspicion; but she did not
confide either to her guileless companion, who was distracted between
her admiring affection for Katharine and her absolute belief in
Robert's faultlessness.


The interview between Robert and Lady Henmarsh was not more
communicative on his part than that which had taken place at the
Brixton villa, in so far as the motive of Katharine's flight was
concerned. ""Cousin Hetty"" had so much to say about Mr. Guyon's death,
and was so much agitated by it, that Robert's kindness of heart would,
under any circumstances, have prevented his telling her any thing
derogatory to the memory of the dead man. He therefore confined
himself to a general statement of the circumstances. Lady Henmarsh was
genuinely astonished, and honestly concerned. She thought in her heart
that Katharine was the ""greatest fool"" in existence. ""The other man is
married,"" said she to herself, ""and therefore out of her reach. She
has not run off with any one else; and unless she was really too well
off, and bored to death by having every thing she wished for, I cannot
understand her conduct."" Her manner was perfect in its sympathy with
Mr. Streightley, and in her condemnation of his wife, whose flight
she, however, took care to represent as merely a caprice, a little bit
of temper,--""she always had an ungovernable temper,"" said Lady
Henmarsh, in a parenthesis,--but of the worst possible taste under the
circumstances.

""Did I understand you rightly, that Katharine was with her poor dear
father when he died?"" she asked.

""Yes, she was with him,"" said Robert; ""she was with him all night, and
until near eleven"

So much is written about the law of attraction. I see it working in my life daily. Sometimes I judge it as good, sometimes bad. This is an example of good.

Iím learning more about the process. Mostly we go about our lives letting our subconscious control us. The subconscious is like a computer waiting for commands, functioning well when we have a clean cache and give it precise commands, or operating erratically when we give it confused signals. I have discovered through various life experiences that the subconscious respects and responds to authority, better yet, authority with determination. Iím going to give true examples here.

We had buried our Labrador Abigail. She had been with me for almost sixteen years and with my husband for over a year. Dogs probably do outlast spouses in this day and age. Itís almost a must to have a dog when you live on a farm. It took almost six months before I became ready for another dog. We were beginning to plan out our hiking trails in the woods surrounding the house. Our neighbors were reporting see bob cats and even bears in the area. This hadnít really bothered me, as I hadnít experienced sightings myself. My aunt had made the comment, ďArenít you scared walking in the woods by yourself?Ē Well, I hadnít been; but the power of her words seeped in.

The next day as I was walking enjoying the beauty of nature that busy voice within me was talking away. It said, ďGod, I think Iím reading for another dog now, preferably a German Shepard, as you know that is what Chris wants, since he seems to think that breed will provide me protection out here.Ē My busy inner voice continued on to some other matter, as I walked on towards the house.

The next day I went out to enjoy the path we had lain out thus far. As I was within a tenth of a mile from the house, I saw what seemed to be a pure bred German Shepard facing me. We both stood there frozen staring at each other for a moment. My mind kept saying over and over, please be friendlyÖ please be friendly. The dog followed me back to the house. It took a little while for me to remember the prayer that I had stated the day before. And when I did, I was in total awe. We named the dog Abner. We suspected that there were two dogs; one died along the interstate, the other made itís way through the woods to our"

POLL WATCH

Will this candidate handle President Trump's attacks very well? (CBS News/YouGov battleground poll, 16,500 registered voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 65%

Bernie Sanders — 60%

Joe Biden — 50%

The latest CBS News look at the early states is largely good for Warren, who has gained in the ballot test since last month and who is more decisively seen as electable. Asked whether Warren would beat Trump, 56 percent of Democrats say she would — up from 39 percent in June. Even more telling of Warren's position is the confidence Democrats have about who could handle attacks from Trump. By a small margin, Democrats say that Trump's impeachment-prompting attacks on Biden's son, Hunter, have made them more sympathetic toward Biden, but by a 15-point margin they say Warren is readier to handle the president.

That's a sea change from six or even three months ago, when the conventional wisdom was that the president, who had goaded Warren into taking a DNA test, would pummel her out of contention by calling her “Pocahontas.” The president has continued to refer to the senator from Massachusetts with that nickname, which he appropriated from anti-Warren conservative media in Massachusetts. But it no longer shapes coverage about her.

IN THE STATES

Illinois. Republicans lost one of their early recruits in the race for the House when former lieutenant governor Evelyn Sanguinetti dropped out of the race for Illinois's 6th District. The suburban Chicago-area 6th, originally drawn to be safe for Republicans, backed Mitt Romney in 2012 by 8.2 points, supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 7 points, and elected Democratic Rep. Sean Casten last year by 7.2 points. But Sanguinetti was wildly out-fundraised by Casten and said while quitting the race that she did not want to suffer the “destruction” of a primary against conservative Jeanne Ives. The state has one of the country's earliest primaries, in March; the filing deadline to enter it is six weeks away.

296,18,27862,"In the next three decades cooling a warmer world will bring soaring demand for equipment to bring the mercury down. The appetite for energy to fuel air-conditioning, cold stores, refrigerated transport and medical “cold chains” that preserve vital vaccines could rise nearly five-fold.

So, paradoxically, humans will raise the planetary average temperatures even higher in the effort to keep cool. A new study calculates that, between now and 2050, an estimated 19 cooling appliances will be sold every second, and to meet global demand three decades on the number of cooling appliances in use worldwide must reach 14 billion.

And even then, many lives will be exposed to dangerous levels of temperature and humidity during extreme summer heat.

But the hazard of climate change driven by global warming, itself fuelled by human use of fossil fuels to deliver the energy both to power economies and to cool the great cities, is not the only force that will bring ever greater investment in cool technologies.

That seems like a very strange abstraction policy.

Social means a bit more than just Facebook. It also means primitives for
things like collaborative editors and coworking spaces, video conferencing,
etc. IMO the ideal social system would look a lot like a mix between the old
timesharing systems, the early Internet and Douglas Engelbarts ""Mother of All
Demos"":

Well it comes with the community. The way Urbit is structured your personal

Politics are part of being social and part of communities. If you don't have a

C’est l’une des nouveautés de la loi orientation et réussite des étudiants (ORE) de mars, qui bouleverse les règles d’accès dans l’enseignement supérieur : la création de commissions d’accès à l’enseignement supérieur (CAES). Dans chaque académie, ces commissions rectorales sont chargées de prendre sous leur aile les milliers de candidats qui n’ont obtenu que des réponses négatives à leurs vœux d’orientation sur Parcoursup, la nouvelle procédure d’admission post-bac. Ils étaient 30 000 le 22 mai. Pour l’instant, seuls les candidats n’ayant fait des vœux que dans des formations sélectives dont ils ont été déboutés peuvent saisir la CAES. A partir du 7 juillet seront aussi concernés, plus largement, tous les candidats n’ayant pas obtenu de proposition. Comment fonctionnent ces commissions? Premiers éléments de réponse.

Les commissions ont-elles déjà commencé à faire des propositions?

Selon les chiffres du ministère en date du 12 juin, sur les quelque 30 000 candidats n’ayant reçu que des réponses négatives, 7 430 ont d’ores et déjà demandé au recteur de les accompagner, par le biais de l’onglet prévu à cet effet sur Parcoursup. Mais cela ne signifie pas pour autant qu’ils ont reçu des propositions de la part de la commission.

Car si le 22 mai, à l’occasion des premiers résultats de Parcoursup, la ministre de l’enseignement supérieur, Frédérique Vidal, laissait entendre que les commissions étaient en place et commençaient déjà à faire des propositions, dans les académies c’est un peu plus compliqué, et plus lent. La raison? Les commissions ne peuvent faire des propositions que lorsque des places sont disponibles dans des formations. Or, ce n’est qu’au fur et à mesure des désistements de candidats et de l’épuisement des listes d’attente que les formations savent si elles ont des places disponibles et peuvent donc les proposer, entre autres, aux commissions rectorales. Exception faite des formations, extrêmement minoritaires, où le nombre de candidats était d’emblée inférieur au nombre de places disponibles.

Dans plusieurs académies, où les commissions se réunissent une fois par semaine ou toutes les deux semaines, de premières propositions formelles ont cependant déjà pu être faites. C’est le cas à Lille, Marseille, ou encore à Grenoble. Il y a quelques jours, des membres de la commission régionale d’Ile-de-France estimaient pour leur part devoir attendre la fin juin pour voir la situation se décanter et ainsi faire des propositions aux candidats.

Quail Hollow Integrated Arts (QHIA): Hogwarts day on Halloween was a blast! Students sorted into houses by taking a quiz, then studied our spells and had a wizarding duel in the dance room (Improv game using spell casting instead of the word, “Splat”.) Carolyn, Jamey’s mom, joined us for an impromptu story at the end of the day while we enjoyed our butterbeer. For the rest of the week we had a mellow pace, learning/discussing, notetaking on the history of World Religions, which is our next history unit. The students gave great feedback regarding the problem solving class we had. All were working together and sharing strategies on how to solve these tricky math problems. On Thursday, Jen Sims joined us for our monthly talking topic, “Listening”. Wednesday, November 15: QHIA Movie/Game Night/World Foods Potluck from 6-8:30pm Parents, please join us for an evening of exploring foods from different countries/cultures, with the option for the kids to watch a movie, play games, etc. Next week each student will select the food that they will prepare.STOMP!

After a discussion of leaves and trees, and the story, We are Going on a Leaf Hunt, we walked along the river and collected interesting leaves. We stopped at the Fremont Tree and made leaf rubbings of various leaves and bark in our nature journals. We had a wonderful day at the Scott's Valley Public Library. We were well taken care of by Librarian, Victor Willis. All friends were issued their own library card and given the responsibility of caring for books that everyone can enjoy. We were given a tour of the library, and specifically explained the layout of the children's section. Then he read a few wonderful stories. We spent the next happy hour exploring the shelves and reading stories to each other. We walked to Sky Park where we ate lunch, and friends played at the playground. We played an active game of clothes pin tag and ended the day with another story.

305,26,7624,"Digital signal processing is well known and is used in a variety of products. A general purpose computer chip, commonly called a CPU (an acronym for “Central Processing Unit”) may be configured to operate on data representative of a “signal” and those operations may correspond to meaningful operation upon that signal, such as, for example, to find the maximum excursion of that signal, or to find the maximum frequency component present in that signal. The word “signal” is used to indicate that the data represent a continuously varying parameter, such as a sound pressure or image brightness or other parameter that varies with time. Data representing the height of trees growing in a parkland is not a signal in this sense—it has no variation with time, it represents a snapshot of a particular height of the trees.
Some meaningful operations on signals are computationally expensive—many primitive operations are needed to complete the operation on the data. Fourier analysis (decomposition into frequency components) is one such example. For this reason special purpose processing elements have been designed—these are CPUs that are specialized to process data representing a signal and include hardware to simplify or optimize what would otherwise be time consuming operations on a general purpose CPU. Such specialized CPU's are referred to as DSP's an acronym for Digital Signal Processor.
In the detailed operation of a DSP device we may identify a further distinction: those DSP's devices that operate continuously and those that operate in a batch mode. For example, in performing a common operation called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) a section of the digital signal is taken into an input buffer—a temporary store of a number of signal samples. An operation, typically of many steps, then proceeds to operate upon the section of the data present in the input buffer, finally creating a second collection of data elements that can be considered an output buffer of data now representing the frequency decomposition of the signal data present in the input buffer. Thus, this DSP has completed an operation in a batch mode—it is only necessary that the batch operation upon the input buffer be compete before a second input buffer has filled—the faster that the batch operation proceeds the better, since the DSP processor then has time to complete other potentially useful operations. Contrast this FFT example of a batch mode operation with the operation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. This is a signal processing method well know in the art, where a weighted summation of the input signal over a period of time is created to represent an output signal. The output signal has a lower frequency variation than the input. For example, a weigh scale in a supermarket checkout may be a source of a digital data signal. It may output a digital number representing the weight on the pan at a rate of 100 samples (measurements) per second. If these digital numbers were displayed they would flicker at up to 100 times a second since the measurement returned is not identical to the 1/10 of a gram each time. This would be disconcerting and it is desirable to present a number to the customer that is stable, free from flicker. To accomplish this, a FIR filter may be used. The FIR filter takes the last 10 measurements and sums them, then presents to the display 1/10th of the sum. Each time a new number is available from the input digital signal the old number, taken ten samples ago, is lost and the new sample is added. Therefore, a new output of 1/10th the sum of the last 10 inputs is available 100-times a second and this new output data has fewer flickers, less variation, since it is the average of the last 10 results.
This weigh scale FIR example shows a second and distinct mode of operation from the FFT example: specifically, the weigh scale FIR operates continually, it does not operate in batch mode. It is useful to note that it accepts a stream of input data samples and creates a stream of output data samples. Significantly, there is no difference in operation at each presentation of new data—there is no “control state” in the operation of the FIR. There is significant “control state” in the operation of the FFT. The presence of a complex control state may be taken to distinguish a Stream Signal Processor (SSP) from a more generic DSP: the SSP is executing the identical operation (or operations) per new input data sample, the non-stream processing DSP is executing a complex sequence of operations, possibly not even at the rate of new input data. In the known art the generic non-stream processing DSP has a “program"
306,23,23428,"The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device. A liquid crystal display panel employed in the liquid crystal display device comprises a pair of opposed substrates sealed along their peripheries to form an envelope for a layer of liquid crystal material and a plurality of electrodes for defining pixels on an inner surface of at least one of said pair of opposed substrates. Each pixel has a function of controlling the amount of light passing therethrough.
In general, the liquid crystal display devices are known which comprise a liquid crystal display panel using a pair of transparent substrates and a backlight disposed behind the liquid crystal display panel such that images are produced by controlling the amount of light passing through the liquid crystal display panel from the backlight.
The backlight is housed in a frame made of resin (hereinafter referred to as a lower case). The liquid crystal display panel is placed on the lower case so that the liquid crystal display panel is illuminated by the backlight.
The lower case serves mainly to house the backlight, supports the liquid crystal display panel and serves as a mask for projecting light from the backlight onto an area for displaying images of the liquid crystal display panel (hereinafter referred to as a display area).
Such a technique is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,626 (Application No. 29,622) issued on Jul. 11, 1995, for example, which employs a case for housing a backlight and an intermediate frame interposed between the case and a liquid crystal display panel.
But with a tendency toward large-sized display area, there arises a problem with the prior art liquid crystal display device that the mechanical strength of the lower case needs to be increased for housing a large-sized backlight and consequently the thickness of the lower case is required to be increased. This increases the width of the non-useful display area at the borders of the liquid crystal display panel (hereinafter referred to as a border area).
As explained above, the lower case supports the liquid crystal display panel and serves as a mask for projecting light from the backlight onto a display area of the liquid crystal display panel. With this structure, there is a possibility that shading occurs at the peripheries of the display area of the liquid crystal display panel viewed from the observer side.
Since the thickness of portions of the lower case serving as a mask is relatively greater, the portions block the light from the backlight and cause the shading at the peripheries at the display area of the liquid crystal display panel viewed from the observer side.
It is an object of the present invention to solve the above problem with the prior art and to provide a liquid crystal display device capable of securing a sufficient mechanical strength of the lower case without increasing the border area of the large-sized liquid crystal display panel.
It is another object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal display device free from occurrence of the"

============

Interactions between pathogens and their hosts are complex and dynamic [@pone.0026544-Haraga1]. The outcomes of these interactions reflect the properties of the pathogenic agent and the ability of the host to respond to infection. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions should contribute to improvement in treatment and control of infections. Characterization of host-pathogen interactions has advanced greatly over the past two decades, mainly through employment of cell cultures and animal models [@pone.0026544-Haraga1], [@pone.0026544-Galan1], [@pone.0026544-Cain1]. However, improved understanding of the cellular mechanisms of such interactions remains elusive.

Although some methods have been developed to study the interaction between pathogens and hosts, most are static endpoint assays and use a single-time point after infection to assess the cellular response [@pone.0026544-Finlay1], [@pone.0026544-Finlay2]. Cell behaviors are normally studied by microscopic examination of cell density and morphology [@pone.0026544-Finlay1]. In addition, endpoint assays use expensive reagents such as antibodies or fluorescent probes and require tedious cell manipulation, making them unsuitable for high-throughput analysis and increasing the exposure of lab workers to pathogens.

Label-free cell detection using cell-electrode impedance readout was first introduced by Giaever and Keese almost in two decades ago [@pone.0026544-Giaever1], [@pone.0026544-Giaever2]. This detection is noninvasive to cells, allowing for continuously monitoring of cellular responses to stimulations in real time. A label-free detection system (xCELLigence system, Roche Applied Science and ACEA Biosciences Inc.) was developed recently based on microelectronic biosensor technology. Electrode impedance is primarily determined by the ion environment at the electrode/solution interface and in the bulk solution. The cells on the electrode act as isolation and alter the ionic environment at the electrode/solution interface, leading to an increase in electrode impedance. Therefore, cell impedance is mainly determined by the number of cells attached to the electrodes, while cell adhesion or spreading also leads to changes in cell impedance (<http://www.aceabio.com>). Recently, this system has been applied to a wide range of cell-based assays, including quality control of cell cultures [@pone.0026544-Kirstein1], assays for cytotoxicity and proliferation [@pone.0026544-Solly1], cell adhesion and spreading [@pone.0026544-Atienza1], receptor kinase activation [@pone.0026544-Atienza2], mast cell activation [@pone.0026544-Abassi1], and G protein-coupled receptor activation [@pone.0026544-Yu1].

In this work, we developed an impedance-based assay for real-time monitoring of the cellular response to bacterial infection. We applied this method to studying the infection of intestinal epithelial cells by *Salmonella*. The resulting time-dependent cell response profiles (TCRPs) reflected the entire process of *Salmonella* infection. The specificity and sensitivity of the TCRPs of a *Salmonella* infection were confirmed using currently available endpoint assays. Our data indicate that the TCRP-based technique can provide continuous and quantitative information for studying the cellular mechanism of interactions between *Salmonella* or other bacteria with diverse host cells.

For the proof, a key ingredient is the following result: if $G$ is a connected and smooth algebraic group and $\mathcal L$ is a $G$-invariant invertible sheaf on a $G$-variety $X$, then the action of $G$ on $X$ extends to a projective action on the complete linear system ${\Bbb P}(H^0(X,{\mathcal L}))$. As an application of the affineness criterion, we give a new and simple proof of the Chevalley-Barsotti Theorem on the structure of algebraic groups.'

During a meeting off campus this semester, a colleague in the business college spoke to me about a course on the history of globalization that we had once taught together. She told me, with some consternation, that the class, cross-listed with business and history when we taught it, had been dropped from the history-department listing when, with my blessing, she had gone solo with it. With her enrollment numbers flagging, she wondered if I could find out what had happened.

The request was, quite literally, academic. We both knew that the disappearance of her class from my department’s course listing had nothing to do with her credentials: As a newly minted Berkeley Ph.D., fluent in a half-dozen languages, and as a promising scholar, my colleague was also a caring and committed teacher. Nor did the disappearance have anything to do with the course’s relevance for history majors: With Tony Judt’s Postwar as our principal text, along with flurries of historical accounts and source documents, the class was steeped in historical methodology.

When I wrote to the chair of our history department, my suspicion was confirmed. The department would not list any courses taught by faculty members other than its own. One needn’t be from the economics department to know the reason: With history’s declining enrollment, we needed to preserve what we could for our own faculty. But it might take an economist—not to mention a humanist—to explain why that reflex is, in the long run, self-defeating.

While I have not undertaken a systematic study, what colleagues at my university and at others have told me suggests we aren’t the only ones circling the wagons. Of course, given the territorial"

The Youngest Soldier

Khalil Quarles loves the U.S. military. Not only does the 10-year-old boy idolize those who serve, but has dreamt for years about putting on his country's uniform.

""He has Army figurines and talks about the Army all the time,"" U.S. Army Maj. Norland James told The Unknown Soldiers from Kuwait on Dec. 21. ""He would love it if he could have a picture from an Army soldier or become an Army soldier himself.""

Tragically, a terrible disease stands between Khalil and his dreams. The young boy, who lives in Baltimore, is suffering from terminal cancer. So when Maj. James heard about Khalil through a friend who works as a hospice nurse, the deployed soldier decided to act.

""We wanted to make his dreams come true,"" James said.

The 37-year-old soldier, who is serving in Kuwait as chief of medical logistics operations, has devoted the last 13 years of his life to the Army. The Albany, Ga., native, who has also been to Afghanistan twice, just spent another holiday season apart from his family and friends.

Amid the continuing sacrifices of military service, James remains intensely appreciative of civilians who support the men and women of the armed forces. When presented with a chance to brighten what could be Khalil's last holiday season, the soldier knew it was his opportunity to give back.

""It's one thing to say 'thank you' with words, but it's another thing to say 'thank you' with actions coming behind it,"" James said.

Six days before Christmas, a nurse told Khalil that someone special was waiting to talk to him on Skype.

""He was like 'wow, I can't believe it, I'm talking to an Army soldier in Kuwait who's deployed,'"" James said.

The soldier will never forget the boy's"

This court has authority to disagree with the fact-finder's determination ""only when the record clearly indicates such a step is necessary to arrest the occurrence of a manifest injustice."" Id. The evidence supporting the elements of the offense, considering only evidence of damage caused by Bolyard's pouring paint on the pickup and cutting the waterbed in an amount over $1,500 and less than $20,000, is not weak. Bolyard does not refer us to any evidence that the damage that he caused by his alleged actions was less than $1,500, only to evidence showing that the total amount of damage to the pickup and waterbed themselves was less than $1,500. Therefore, there is no showing that the evidence supporting the verdict is so weak that the verdict is clearly wrong and manifestly unjust or that the evidence contrary to the verdict is so strong that the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden of proof could not have been met. Bolyard merely repeats his variance claim, *809 and we have held that there is no variance. We, therefore, hold that the evidence is factually sufficient to support Bolyard's conviction. Bolyard's authorities are all based upon the mistaken premise that there is a variance. We overrule Points of Error Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Of the 12 Power 5 college football programs that changed coaches late in the fall of 2017, eight saw an improvement Wednesday — seven of them by a healthy margin — over their 247Sports.com national composite recruiting ranking from a year ago.

Or as Yoda might say: On one recruiting cycle, judge Mel Tucker not.

“You never usually have a good class your first signing day,” former Colorado Buffaloes assistant coach and current Big Ten Network television pundit Gerry DiNardo told The Post. “That (cycle) certainly has changed for first-year coaches. (Minnesota’s) P.J. Fleck, he talked the administration into calling his first year, ‘Year Zero.’ And now he just finished ‘Year 1.’ That’s another approach.”

FBS coaches don’t have to just hit the ground running anymore. They’re expected to turn up at a full-on Usain Bolt sprint.

CU introduced Tucker as its new coach Dec. 5. The new early National Signing Day period for Division I prospects runs Wednesday through Friday. It’s hard enough for a coach to master the first names of the guys down the hall in two weeks, let alone the names of two dozen prospects and their parents-slash-guardians upon whom the ceiling of your program, and your job security, depend.

“(The early signing period) is hard, I think, for a couple of reasons,” Brandon Huffman, national recruiting editor with 247Sports.com, said of the challenge facing Tucker. “First, it (depends on) what kind of system are you installing. Are the guys who are already committed, do they gel with what you do?

322,10,7681," 135, 145 (Mo. banc 2007). A trial court has abused its discretion when a ruling is clearly against the logic of the circumstances and is so unreasonable as to indicate a lack of careful consideration. Id.
Section 557.036, RSMo Cum.Supp. 2006, outlines the type of evidence allowed to be presented during the penalty-phase and provides in pertinent part:
Evidence supporting or mitigating punishment may be presented. Such evidence may include, within the discretion of the court, evidence concerning the impact of the crime upon the victim, the victim's family and others, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history and character of the defendant.
Defendant argues the jury is entitled to rely on the same resources as the judge, who here was presented with the sentencing guidelines, in determining punishment. We are not persuaded by Defendant's argument. Relying on the guidelines alone creates a risk the jury will place too much emphasis on them and not treat them simply as recommendations. State v. Forrest, 183 S.W.3d 218, 226 (Mo. banc 2006)(in affirming a death penalty case, the court *91 held that a judge, unlike a jury, is ""presumed not to consider improper evidence during sentencing"").
In 1994, the Missouri Legislature transformed the already-existing Sentencing Commission into the Commission. State v. Lynch, 131 S.W.3d 422, 427 (Mo. App. W.D. 2004). The legislature created the Commission to study sentencing practices and disparities among the circuit courts of Missouri and to ""establish a system of recommended sentences, within the statutory minimum and maximum sentences provided by law for each felony committed under the laws of this state."" Section 558.019.6(3); Id. The sentencing guidelines created by the Commission are only guidelines or recommendations; the trial court is not mandated to follow the recommendations, but it must stay within the statutory range of punishment. Lynch, 131 S.W.3d at 427.
In State v. Prosser, 186 S.W.3d 330 (Mo. App. E.D. 2005), the court examined the legislative intent behind Section 557.036.3. The court concluded ""the purpose of having a separate penalty phase in non-capital trials, as in capital trials, is to permit a broader range of evidence relevant to the appropriate punishment to be imposed."" Id. at 333. The statute expressly provides what evidence is permissible to support or mitigate punishment. However, because the sentencing guidelines do not address the specifics of Defendant or his offense, they are beyond the scope of evidence allowed during the penalty-phase. See State v. Griffin, 756 S.W.2d 475, 486 (Mo. banc 1988)(not error to exclude expert's testimony relating generally to the deterrent effect of death penalty inasmuch as testimony would not have aided jury in assessing aggravating and mitigating circumstances in murder trial).
The guidelines alone are insufficient to determine punishment as they do not account for the history and character of the offender, nor the circumstances of his crime. Prosser, 186 S.W.3d at 332; Section 557.036, RSMo Cum.Supp. 2006. Moreover, the sentencing guidelines are beyond the scope of permissible evidence allowed in the penalty-phase of a jury trial as articulated by Section 557.036, RSMo Cum.Supp. 2006. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defense counsel's offer of proof and excluding testimony regarding Missouri's sentencing guidelines. Point one is denied.
In his second point, Defendant argues the trial court erred and abused its discretion in refusing Defendant's Instruction A. Defendant contends Instruction A, which Defendant offered during the second penalty-phase, would have limited the range of punishment to twenty-five years' imprisonment. Defendant claims by allowing the jury to consider the full range of punishment, when the original jury acquitted him of first-degree murder, the trial court violated double jeopardy.[3] We disagree.
Our review of the trial court's refusal to give a tendered instruction is for abuse of discretion. State v. Orton, 178 S.W.3d 589, 591 (Mo.App. E.D. 2005). Here, Defendant offered Instruction A at the second penalty-phase. Instruction A was an alternative to Instruction 3, which was patterned after MAI 305.01 and outlined the statutory range of punishment for second-degree murder and armed criminal action. Instruction 3 provided:
Defendant has been found guilty of murder in the second degree and armed criminal action. It will be your duty to determine within the limits prescribed *92 by law"

George Joseph O'Shea (March 24, 1899 – August 17, 1983) was a highly decorated officer in the United States Marine Corps with the rank of brigadier general. He was decorated with the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat, during Battle of Sapotillal in October 1927. O'Shea served in the Pacific theater during World War II and retired in 1952 as director of 1st Marine Corps Reserve District in Boston.

Early career

O'Shea was born on March 24, 1899, in Brooklyn, New York, as the son of George and Marcella O'Shea. He attended the Brooklyn College Preparatory School and subsequently received appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in June 1918. He graduated with Bachelor of Science degree in June 1922 and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps at the same time. Many of his classmates became general officers later: Hyman G. Rickover, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and Ralph B. DeWitt.

O'Shea was then ordered to the Basic School at Marine Barracks Quantico for basic officer training, which he completed one year later. He was then ordered to the Marine barracks within Norfolk Navy Yard, Virginia, where he remained for brief period, before he was attached to the Second Brigade of Marines and ordered to Santo Domingo. When the brigade departed Santo Domingo in summer 1924, O'Shea was ordered to the Virgin Islands in July 1924 and joined the Marine barracks at local Naval Station, where he remained until January 1926, when he was ordered to the United States for duty with 5th Marine Regiment. He was stationed at Philadelphia Navy Yard until October 1926, when he was ordered to Boston for Mail Guard Duty during the Wave of robberies.

He returned to Quantico in January 1927 and sailed for expeditionary duty to Nicaragua two months later. O'Shea was promoted to first lieutenant shortly after his arrival and participated in the jungle patrols against hostile bandits under Augusto César Sandino. He distinguished himself on October 9, 1927, when he led a small patrol near Sapotillal in Nueva Segovia Department during the rescue mission of two downed Marine aviators. His unit was subsequently ambushed by vastly superior force of Sandinitas, but O'Shea and his Marines repulsed the enemy and successfully withdrew from the area. For his heroism in combat and skillful leadership, he was decorated with the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat and also received the Presidential Medal of Merit with Diploma from the Government of Nicaragua.

O'Shea returned to the United States in February 1928 and assumed duty at the Marine Barracks, New York Navy Yard, before he was ordered to the Marine detachment at the Rifle Range, Wakefield, Massachusetts. He remained in that capacity until October of that year, when he was sent to Haiti for duty as Assistant Chief of Police at Port-au-Prince while attached to the Garde d'Haïti. In this capacity, he participated in the training of Haitian Constabulary in combat operations against Cacos bandits and received Haitian Distinguished Service Medal.

In September 1930, O'Shea returned to the United States in order to enter the instruction at the Army Signal School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. He completed the course in June 1931 and assumed duty at Headquarters Marine Corps for brief period. O'Shea was sent to the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico soon thereafter and completed the Company Officers Course there. He then served as an instructor there, before he was appointed Commanications officer, 7th Marine Regiment.

O'Shea began his first tour of sea duty in March 1934, when he was appointed commanding officer of Marine detachment"

Forney Co., 143 App.Div. 73, 127 N.Y.S. 620, 622 it is said, ‘The test of actionable negligence is what reasonably prudent men would have done under the same circumstances’; Connell v. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co., 144 App.Div. 664, 129 N.Y.S. 666, 669, holds that actionable negligence must be predicated upon ‘a breach of duty to the plaintiff. Negligence is ‘not absolute or intrinsic,’ but ‘is always relevant to some circumstances of time, place or person.’ In slight paraphrase of the world’s first bard it may be truly observed that the expedition of the chauffeur’s violent love of his own security outran the pauser, reason, when he was suddenly confronted with unusual emergency which ‘took his reason prisoner’. The learned attorney for the plaintiffs concedes that the chauffeur acted in an emergency but claims a right to recovery upon the following proposition taken verbatim from his brief: ‘It is respectfully submitted that the value of the interests of the public at large to be immune from being injured by a dangerous instrumentality such as a car unattended while in motion is very superior to the right of a driver of a motor vehicle to abandon same while it is in motion even when acting under the belief that his life is in danger and by abandoning same he will save his life’.

To hold thus under the facts adduced herein would be tantamount to a repeal by implication of the primal law of nature written in indelible characters upon the fleshy tablets of sentient creation by the Almighty Law-giver, ‘the supernal Judge who sits on high’. There are those who stem the turbulent current for bubble fame, or who bridge the yawning chasm with a leap for the leap’s sake or who ‘outstare the sternest eyes that look outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey’ to win a fair lady and these are the admiration of the generality of men; but they are made of sterner stuff than the ordinary man upon whom the law places no duty of emulation. The law would indeed be fond if it imposed upon the ordinary man the obligation to so demean himself when suddenly confronted with a danger, not of his creation, disregarding the likelihood that such a contingency may darken the intellect and palsy the will of the common legion of the earth, the fraternity of ordinary men, — whose acts or omissions under certain conditions or circumstances make the yardstick by which the law measures culpability or innocence, negligence or care. If a person is placed in a sudden peril from which death might ensue, the law does not impel another to the rescue of the person endangered nor does it condemn him for his unmoral failure to rescue when he can; this is in recognition of the immutable law written in frail flesh.

Returning to our chauffeur. If the philosophic Horatio and the martial companions of his watch were ‘distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear’ when they beheld ‘in the dead vast and middle of the night’ the disembodied spirit of Hamlet’s father stalk majestically by ‘with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger’ was not the chauffeur, though unacquainted with the example of these eminent men-at-arms, more amply justified in his fearsome reactions when he was more palpably confronted by a thing of flesh and blood bearing in its hand an engine of destruction which depended for its lethal purpose"

328,27,13359,"SAN DIEGO, CA - AUGUST 14: Taylor Ward #3 of the Los Angeles Angels hits an RBI double during the second inning of a baseball game against the San Diego Padres at PETCO Park on August 14, 2018 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images)

The September roster expansion is all an interesting time for fans. The LA Angels have recalled seven players since the September 1st expansion from 25 to a 40 man roster. Who will we see next season?

The LA Angels have used their minor league system a lot this season due to numerous injuries and also in-season trades. Twenty players on the current 40-man roster were not there at the beginning of the season. Of these 20 players some of them have been with the Angels since early-to-mid April such as Justin Anderson and Jaime Barria who were called upon early due to injuries to Keynan Middleton, Blake Wood, Matt Shoemaker, and J.C. Ramirez. Three of those players were lost for the season due to torn UCL’s with only Shoemaker returning to the team just this week.

So the question now becomes, who can we expect to see on the 25-man opening day roster in 2019?

Justin Anderson and Jaime Barria are pretty much a lock to make the opening day roster in 2019. Both of them have held their own since being called up to the majors. Anderson has become an internal part of the back end of the Angel bullpen serving as the set-up man and even a part-time closer this season. Barria has served as a starter in the Angels rotation for most of the season and although he has had his rough patches overall he has performed admirably and should be strongly considered for a spot in the Angels 2019 rotation.

Jose Briceno and Francisco Arcia – Both of these catchers have had their moments where they have played very well this season both as back-ups and now as a lefty-righty platoon system since Martin Maldonado was traded at the end of July. There will probably not be room on the roster for both of these catchers as the Angels will probably make a move in the off-season to acquire a starting catcher as Briceno and Arcia are both more suited for a back-up role. Arcia may have the upper hand as he is left-handed and has shown a little better numbers at the plate, but it is a toss-up.

Joe Hudson – Hudson was just recalled from Salt Lake City when the rosters expanded this week. We will see how he does in September, but unless he kills it Hudson will be a long shot to make the roster in 2019.

Jose Miguel Fernandez – Fernandez has been up and down with the Angels this season and has done some positive things for the team when he has been up. Fernandez can play both first and second base which makes him somewhat versatile, but most likely he is still a long"

331,10,9734,"35) A blow to the British Class system

Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester in Eton school uniform, 1914/Wikimedia

“VI. Every gentleman or yeoman in the Islands possessing 'thriescore kye,' and having children, to send at least his eldest son, or, failing sons, his eldest daughter, to some school in the Lowlands, there to be kept and brought up 'quhill they may be found able sufficientlie to speik, reid, and wryte Inglische.!'” - from the Statues of Iona, 24th August, 1609

There are two kinds of class system in operation in Britain, and they are so intwined as to be almost indistinguishable. One is defined through wealth, or, if you prefer, through economic relations to the means of production. This system is in operation across most of the world in one form or another and there is little reason to believe that it would be abolished in an independent Scotland, though hopefully the balance of power would shift.

The other class system, bound up with the first, helping hold it together, but distinguishable from it, is that for which Britain is famous the world over. It is a system of accents and culture and education and birth: the difference (in most of the UK) between rugby and football, “received pronunciation” and regional accents, tea first and milk first – or, in fact, what the word 'tea' implies at all. It is also the difference which allows a tiny elite from a handful of schools to cling on to so much power.

The upper class of this system is not so much Scottish, or Irish, or Welsh or even English. Though it leans from Norman roots, to an Anglicised exterior and its branches bend for each of the national identities on these islands, it is at core profoundly British. The 17th Century Statutes of Iona (see above) were but one small step in the careful construction of that archipelagic elite, along with Ireland's protestant ascendency and the Balmoralty's romanticisation of Scotland in the eyes of England's ruling class.

The upper classes in Scotland, Wales and each of England's regions speak the same, dress the same and have the same set of interests and cultural cues. They include amongst them the families that have sent their children to Oxbridge for 800 years and still own a third of the land in Britain – and an even more disproportionate share in Scotland. They have a class solidarity which dates back hundreds of years and through which they end up with a vast portion of the power in our economy and our politics to this day. I say “they”. Perhaps, I should say “we”, for it is into this class that I was born.

This very specific British class system has grown up around a particular constitutional framework and the imperial then post-imperial culture of this specific United Kingdom. It's entwined with a set of national narratives which encourage a sense not just that Britain rules the waves, but that Britain's upper classes are born to rule: from public school boy national heroes to Waterloo being won on the playing fields of Eton, it's no wonder that British politics looks at Brown and Miliband and Cameron, and declares the one who went to school in a white tie and tails is the one who isn't weird.

One constitutional change won't end elitism in the UK. But the demise of the political unit that is Britain will be a blow to that specific British class system, and about time too.

Divestment is eminently achievable, economically viable, and environmentally meaningful; by listening to its students and fully divesting from fossil fuels the University of Edinburgh could take a powerful stance on climate change.

Protests and occupations can seem drastic and radical, but they are a frustrated last resort, born of the fact that the University’s senior management have made it quite clear that they have no interest in divesting or listening to the voices of students.
In 2014, following three years of lobbying by People & Planet (P&P), the University consulted its students with an ethical investments survey. An overwhelming majority of respondents were found to be in favour of divestment. Despite this, last May the University’s management still decided against divesting, prompting students to stage a 10-day occupation of the finance department in protest. The protesters were partially successful and the University agreed to divest from coal and tar sands (among the most carbon intensive fossil fuels) by October 2015. However, the sad fact is that all the progress which Edinburgh has made towards divestment has been a reluctant response to student campaigning. The University has done nothing of its own volition.

Despite this, the University of Edinburgh never misses a chance to flaunt its flimsy eco-credentials, or ostentatiously vaunt its environmental research. Laudable as environmental research is, it is irrelevant to divestment. And patching up its damaged reputation with green research projects in no way diminishes the need to change its inherently unsustainable investment portfolio.
There is a ludicrous hypocrisy in the idea of sponsoring climate change research with funds derived from fossil fuel extraction. It’s not enough just to research future technological solutions; if we want to stand a chance of addressing climate change we need to tackle fossil fuel emissions now.

Regardless of the scale of Edinburgh’s current investments in fossil fuels, from the beginning the ethical investment campaign at Edinburgh has not only been about withdrawing existing investments in the industry, but also to make a clear statement against the fossil fuel industry by making a public commitment to never invest in fossil fuels in the future. If Edinburgh genuinely wants to support the essential transition to sustainable energy, it needs to stop propping up the oil industry and instead put some of its ample investments into the rapidly growing renewables sector.
This is why P&P is still campaigning for Edinburgh to withdraw its remaining assets from fossil fuel companies. Last Thursday, P&P staged on overnight occupation of the Old College quad to highlight the University’s continued investment in fossil fuels, with more than 60 students turning out to show support. Senior management, however, have given no indication that they take student objections seriously.

To address a common concern, divesting from fossil fuels is not economically dangerous. In the past few years hundreds of public and private institutions have divested over £3.5 trillion pounds from fossil fuels. If the British Medical Association; the Rockefeller Foundation; the Universities of Glasgow, Sheffield, Warwick, Bedfordshire and Surrey; and the World Council of Churches have all found divestment to be in their best financial interests, the idea that Edinburgh must remain permanently shackled to fossil fuels seems perplexing at best.

Ironically, Edinburgh’s investment policy contradicts its own research. Last September, a study by the University’s own Business School, found that green funds outperformed fossil fuel investments by more than 14 per cent over a two year period. Moreover, the plummeting drop in oil prices last autumn surely put pay to any idea that oil was a stable or reliable investment. In its stubborn, feet-dragging reluctance the University seems oblivious to the terrifying urgency of addressing climate change.

The devastating effects of rising temperatures are already being felt around the world and will only get worse. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has estimated that climate change will displace 250 million people by 2050. Amnesty International has warned that if emissions are not reduced some 600 million people could face famine.

If we seriously want to avert these catastrophes, we must heed the warnings of climate scientists and avoid the crucial 2°C temperature rise. To do that we must break our century-old dependence on fossil fuels. By refusing to divest from these industries the University is becoming complicit in perpetuating anthropogenic climate change, and all the disastrous social, economic and health-related consequences that come with it.
According to the mission statement on its website, Edinburgh aims to ‘make a significant, sustainable and socially responsible contribution to Scotland, the UK and the world’. If the University truly wishes to make a sustainable and socially responsible contribution it is imperative that it puts its money where"

A large volume of information was directed through mean systolic blood pressure during active stand (C~c~ = 0.71, S~c~ = 16) which also exerted significant influence over other nodes (B~c~ = 0.8). This is further reflected in a lower topological coefficient for this node (T~c~ = 0.33) indicating a central, moderating influence. Within module 2, end diastolic volume (C~c~ = 0.75, S~c~ = 8, B~c~ = 0.67) and stroke volume (C~c~ = 0.75, C~s~ = 8, B~c~ = 0.67) exerted primary control over other nodes.

338,1,17714,"Q:

Use of classical equations of motion inside correlation functions

I am reading this paper by Zamolodchikov about the expectation value of $T \bar{T}$ in $2d$ QFT and I don't understand how he uses the classical equations of motion. For instance, classically, in any translationally invariant field theory, you have the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor:

$\partial_{\mu} T^{\mu \nu} = 0$.

However, this only holds on shell, so in the quantum theory what you have is a Ward identity:

$ \frac{\partial }{\partial x^{\mu}} \langle T^{\mu \nu} (x) X \rangle = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta( \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i ) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\nu}_i} \langle X \rangle $, 

where $X$ is a string of fields that depend on the points $\mathbf{x}_1,..., \mathbf{x}_n$.
My question is: why does he uses the classical type of equation instead of the quantum type of equation even inside correlation functions?
Comment: I think I have been able to get to Eq. (9) using the Ward identities, but I haven't been able to reproduce Eq. (11). In any case I think my doubt goes beyond the paper. It's just the example I have.

A:

Quantum field theory is a quantum theory. In quantum theory we have operators which act on states. $T^{\mu\nu}(x)$ is an operator of this kind. For example, we can write
$$
|\Psi\rangle =T^{\mu\nu}(x)|0\rangle,
$$
and so on. (To be more precise, fields are operator-valued distributions, and for $|\Psi\rangle$ to be an honest state we need to smear $T$ as $\int d^dx f(x) T^{\mu\nu}(x)$ where $f$ is a test function. Also, we should interpret all equations below in distributional sense.)
This operator satisfies the equation

Updated on July 19, 2009

Teachers use rubber stamps as a way of giving feedback on work which they have marked. Some say words, such as well done, whereas others have images or pictures. It is likely there will be a rubber teachers stamp for virtually any marking purpose online, and for a variety of ages. Some of the most popular rubber teacher stamps which can be found on the internet are outlined here, along with a handy link to external pages where the product can be purchased.

TEACHER STAMPS

TEACHER STAMPS are one of the most popular set of rubber stamps for teachers available on the internet. The stamps are contained within a convenient storage box which is an added bonus, especially as there are 30 rubber teachers stamps contained within this one set. The set includes a large variety of stamps. Some are positive such as 'Great Work' and 'Well Done'. Others however give further instruction to the student with words such as 'Needs Improvement'. An ink pad needs to be used in conjunction with this particular set of rubber teachers stamps.

SELF-INKING TEACHER STAMPS SET 1

The self-inking teacher stamps set comes with 8 stamps, in a useful storage container. There are a number of messages which are included which give various compliments to the student, as well as stamps designed to encourage the student further.

Educational Insights EZ Stampers Self-Inking Teacher Stamp Set

This item, as shown on the right, is another very popular self-inking rubber teachers stamps set. The set comes with a selection of 12 stamps, however, unlike the other sets does not come in/with a storage box and so the teacher will need to find somewhere to store these stamps. The set comes with a variety of stamps which all have different messages from messages for parents to read through to positive feedback for the student. At the time of writing all of this item's reviews on Amazon gave 5 stars.

Educational Insights Super 6 Stamp Stations

Another form of self-inking rubber teachers stamps are these super 6 stamp stations. These are very clever systems in which there are 6 stamps all contained within one system. Each system has six different stamps all with one theme. Within the system a particular stamp can be selected. There are a number of stamps available. Shown here is one which is designed to reward good writing, and a second which is designed to give messages of encouragement. Each rubber stamp has a simple written message, along with some sort of graphical design such as a cartoon.

Individual self inking rubber teachers stamps

If you do not wish to purchase a complete set of stamps, due to price or only wishing to have one specific stamp it is possible to purchase individual stamps. The ones shown on the right are all self inking rubber teachers stamps which are all on sale on the website for $1, which is a very good price.

The first two which are shown have the message 'Well Done' along with a picture. The first of these has 'Well Done' in the middle of a cloud and the second has the word 'Well Done' being said by a cartoon student worm.

The third and fourth stamps which are shown here both say 'Top Effort'. The first of these has the word surrounded by stars, and the second one has these words accompanied by a cartoon of a pencil or pen.

The final two rubber self-inking teachers stamps shown here in this $1 section both have the words 'Keep Trying'. The first of these is in green and the words 'Keep Trying' also have a cartoon of a worm reading a book - a bookworm. The second has the words 'Keep Trying' along with a picture of a young child reading a book.

All of these stamps get good reviews form people who have used them, and obviously they are all only $1 which is an extremely low price.

Ink pads for teachers stamps

Some of the rubber teachers stamps which have already been mentioned are self-inking. However, others are not and so there is the need to buy a separate ink pad. Ink pads for rubber teachers stamps are the same as those used for any other rubber stamps. To the right are two different sort of ink pads for rubber stamps. The first is larger, and just the one colour - black. The second ink pad has six different colours which can add for a bit of variety and some teachers may in fact choose the colour which is the favourite of their student.

Contrary to what your mother told you: banking reality checks and other fables

Once upon a time you were anything-and-everything-in-waiting. And your mama told you, you could be anything you put your mind to. Because you are special. And although your mama didn’t lie to you, what she told you doesn’t actually bind the world. It doesn’t create a cosmic obligation that it should be so. You are not that special. You are not that different. You can’t be everything. And although you can still be anything, time is running out and the way there is neither simple nor linear.

Mama didn’t say it would be this way, perhaps, but there you have it.

You are not that special

Of course this is a piece about digitisation.

And it came to be because I was at an event recently and three people came up to me separately after my talk to tell me how brilliant I was but how none of it applied to them. One felt they were exempt from disruption because they were in investment banking, the fluffy fears of retail did not touch them. One because they operated in a country where the regulator still raised barriers to entry. And one because he would retire soon. None of them were the first of their kind, to tell me how they were different. How their situation was special.

To all I say: pah.

You are not that special.

You are not exempt.

It is coming for everyone so it is coming for you. And if you see other people’s disruption as other people’s problems because you are special and different then you are just like the proverbial man in the flood who berated god for not giving a sign after news crews had beamed and rescue crews had knocked on the door. No said the man. I am special. My faith will save me from the flood. Missing every warning sign and opportunity to be indeed both special and safe.

So if you think you and your sliver of the industry are special and different because of complexity, the price tag of previous IT investment or the greyness of your suits; if you think your special status means you are blissfully exempt from the onslaught of change, I’m afraid I have bad news for you. Mama didn’t lie exactly. You are special. But special is as special does. It wasn’t a hall pass. It was a call to action.

You can’t be everything

We like optionality. We like knowing we are not trapped."

346,6,28454," showed some history of anxiety disorder in their lives. Although there is no evidence that a disorder causes the other, it is clearly evident that many individuals are affected by both (source: http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/depression).
In a recent research on the determining factors for the lack of response in patients with treatment-resistant depression, the presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder was the most significant factor associated with this lack of response (Souery D, Oswald P, Massat I, et al; Group for the Study of Resistant Depression. Clinical factors associated with treatment resistance in major depressive disorder: results from a European multicenter study. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2007, 68: 1062-1070).
Much progress was made on the understanding that the comorbid anxiety disorders to depression disorders are a very common condition. If not treated properly, patients with this comorbidity have a recovery lower than patients with another pure condition, besides of presenting more severe symptoms and in higher number than those observed in patients diagnosed with depression.
Presently, there are several classes of medicines that are used in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
Benzodiazepines for long corresponded to the group of medicines of choice for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Although they are effective in relieving symptoms related to these disorders, this class of medicines triggers tolerance, causes physical dependence and, when the use is interrupted after a long period of time, causes withdrawal syndrome. Due to these disadvantages, this type of medicine is usually prescribed for short periods of time, especially for patients with a history of alcohol abuse or of development of medicine dependence. Examples of medicines belonging to this class are alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam and oxazepam, among others.
Buspirone is a partial agonist of 5-HT1A receptors which has effect in the treatment of anxiety. Since it acts on the serotonergic system, this medicine is associated with a lower incidence of side effects when compared to benzodiazepines. The time required to establish the anxiolytic effect provided by this medicine is considerably long, from four to six weeks to be effective, which is a disadvantage and restricts its use in cases of emergency. Besides this factor, many clinical professionals do not believe that its effectiveness is comparable to that of benzodiazepines (Uriel Halbreich and Stuart A. Montgomery—Pharmacotherapy for Mood, Anxiety, and Cognitive Disorders—American Psychiatric Press. Ed. 2000, pg. 336).
Many medicines originally developed for treating depression relieved the symptoms observed in anxiety disorders.
Tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, desipramime, amitriptyline and clomipramine, among others, were the first medicines developed to treat depression that demonstrated a relieve of symptoms observed in anxiety disorders. The medicines have In common structures comprised by three fused rings, and most of them act as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, blocking the serotonin transporter and the norepinephrine transporter. They also act on muscarinic receptors of cholinergic system and act as antagonists on histamine receptors H1 and H2. Due to the multiple activity on several receptors and transporters, tricyclic drugs are associated with a wide range of side effects, the most dangerous being those related to cardiac and central nervous systems, in case of overdose. Besides this factor, these medicines also trigger the withdrawal syndrome, requiring a gradual reduction of dose until the complete withdrawal. The withdrawal syndrome caused by this class of medicines includes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, unrest, insomnia, headaches, dizziness, runny nose, tremor, chills, weakness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal spasms, malaise, anxiety and irritability, among others (Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1981, 125(5): 420-422).

His episcopal Majesty arrived together with his brother Michał Bal and his brother Stanislaw from Kłobuck, yore a famous of preacher, and two other brothers, designated by order of His Majesty to choose the place according to their taste. Attending also were its highness Jan Kościelecki, governor of Bydgoszcz, (...) There, the brothers chose a place convenient to the monastery as they saw it. ""

The construction of ""St. Jerome and St. Francis church"" has been completed in 1485 and the monastery library in 1488. The original temple was made of brick, as depicted by notes of a preserved chronicle of Bernardine: ""Brothers of the Order after receiving permission for the construction of the convent, performed bricks, prepared lime, (...) cleared the bushes"".

Like often, the Bernardine monastery created an outstanding environment for intellectual culture development in Bydgoszcz. In the years 1518-1524, the abbey was led by Bartholomew of Bydgoszcz, a scholar, author of the first Latin-Polish dictionary (1532, 1544). During the 17th century, the abbot, Paweł of Łęczyca, was an active supporter of urban decorations, founder of the extensive gardens of the monastery, which were ancestors of today's Bydgoszcz parks. The Bernardines created the largest library in the city (1919 volumes, partially preserved until today at the municipal library) and established a rhetoric school (1529-1774), an observatory (1677), and a brewery.
On August 10, 1545, a lightning stroke the abbey, causing a fire that burned down the church and a large part of the monastic buildings, the only buildings left were the library along with the vestry and the infirmary.

On September 23, 1552, king Sigismund II Augustus granted permission for the reconstruction of the burned Bernardine church, with a caveat to its height that should not be taller than the neighboring castle for military-defensive purposes. Its architecture reflects Gothic and Renaissance characteristics. Saint George church was built from 1552-1557, thanks to the financial support of the Kościelecki family. Temple name was then changed to Holy Trinity.

On September 10, 1559, Sebastian of Żydowo, a suffragan of Gniezno, consecrated the Holy Cross altar in the church, and in 1563, bell-founder Herman Benincke from Gdańsk cast the great bell of the monastery. The completion of the reconstruction lasted till the years 1590-1602: at that time, city nobleman Stanislaw Małżewski unveiled the altar of the Holy Cross in the newly built Saint Anne chapel on the south side of the church (the chapel is still standing today). In 1595, Dorothy of Spławski, Jan Kościelecki's wife, the Starost of Bydgoszcz, decorated the chapel of the convent with polychrome and three green rugs. The same year has been also erected the Saint Anne Brotherhood altar.
Damaged during Swedish wars, the building has been rebuilt and renovated in the second half of the 17th century:
 the western church peak was made taller (1648-1686);
 the church tower was rebuilt with a square body (1677), as it is today;
 in 1682-1685, to commemorate the 1683 Battle of Vienna, a chapel was built in the courtyard in front of the church, modeled after the sanctuary in Loreto.

Under Prussian rule, seven altars were reported in the church, with a rich decor and a collection of liturgical objects. According to a site survey carried out in 1745, the church was covered with tiles, the sanctuary having a ceramic floor with aisles made of wood.

In 1605, in the choir, was set a pipe organ, founded by Andrzej Grudziński and Daniel Jastrzębski, town citizens. It was enlarged in 1618, then completely renovated in 1715. It survived until the Secularization of the church decided by Prussian authorities.

Until the end of the 18th century, the crypt was used to bury religious members of the Bernardine Monastery, along with regular people who deserved to be honored by the convent and the church. Most important figures are buried under the floor of the church, including, among others"

1. ASARCO, Inc. transports silver bullion from Laredo, Texas, to Newark, New Jersey, and New York, New York.  Id. at 257; J.A. at 119.  ASARCO, Inc. believes that armored tractor-trailer delivery is essential for adequate protection of its bullion, and that Brink's would provide the needed security.  Id. at 119-20.  During the time in which Brink's held temporary authority for this route, ASARCO, Inc. used its services three times.  Id. at 112-13.

2. Automotive Products Division transports platinum and palladium between Shreveport, Louisiana; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Winslow, New Jersey. 128 M.C.C. at 257.  Although Automotive Products Division did not utilize the Brink's service while Brink's had temporary authority to serve these routes, J.A. at 112-13, it stated that the complex procedures necessary to ship the metals made alternative methods of transportation uneconomical, and that Brink's is the only carrier able to meet its particular transportation requirements.  Id. at 123-24.

3. Engelhard Mineral and Chemicals Corp. transports gold, silver, and platinum between points in northern New Jersey and Chicago, Illinois. 128 M.C.C. at 257-58.  Although Engelhard did not use the Brink's temporary authority, J.A. at 112-13, a representative of Engelhard testified that it anticipated an increasing need for service, and that Brink's is the only carrier capable of meeting its particular demands.  Id. at 142-43.

4. Handy and Harman transports silver and other precious metals between Salt Lake City, Utah; Fairfield, Connecticut; El Monte, California; and Chicago, Illinois. 128 M.C.C. at 258; J.A. at 145.  The shipper testified that from January through July, 1974, it transported approximately 135,000 pounds of metals from Fairfield to El Monte; that those shipments were representative of its actual needs;10 and that Brink's armored tractor-trailer service was necessary for transportation of its precious metals.  Id. at 146-47.

5. J. Aron & Co. transports silver between Laredo, Texas; El Monte, California; Fairfield, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; New York, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Salt Lake City, Utah. 128 M.C.C. at 258.  During the period in which Brink's held authority to operate armored service over these routes, J. Aron transported 32 shipments via Brink's.  J.A. at 112-13.

6. Sharps-Pixley Inc., a trader of precious metals, used International's service to move three truckloads of silver bullion from Chicago to the New York metropolitan area, 128 M.C.C. at 258, but testified that International did not sufficiently meet its needs.  J.A. at 153-54.  International disputed that conclusion.  Id. at 68-74.  Sharps-Pixley had not used Brink's to transport silver bullion from Chicago to New York. "

Modular Functions with Rational Fourier Expansions

I have been reading the paper of Cox, McKay and Stevenhagen ""Principal Moduli and Class Fields"", http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0311202v1.pdf, and I have a question regarding the nature of the function field for $X0(N)$: if I have a modular function for $Γ_0(N)$ that has a rational $q$-expansion at $\infty$, does it follow that $f∈\mathbf{Q}(j,j_N)$?
Allow to me to elaborate on some discoveries I've made reading the above paper, and playing with sage:
I understand that the function field over $\mathbf{C}$ for $X_0(N)$ is $\mathbf{C}(j,j_N)$, and that the $\mathbf{Q}$-function field given by $\mathbf{Q}(j,j_N)$ defines the curve $X_0(N)$ over the rationals. Thus, any modular function for $\Gamma_0(N)$ can be written as rational function in $j$ and $j_N$.
Now, for the case of level $N=1$ modular functions, it is stated in the paper that if $f$ is a modular function that has a fourier expansion at $\infty$ with rational coefficients, then $f$ in fact lies in $\mathbf{Q}(j)$, which seems intuitive. However, I have recently discovered that the analogous fact does not hold for modular functions for $\Gamma_0(N)$ that have a rational fourier expansion at $\infty$. Using a paper of Maier, I have been able to play with the hauptmoduln for $\Gamma_0(N)$ when the group has genus zero. These functions have rational $q$-expansions, but don't necessarily lie in $\mathbf{Q"

If you've already searched for some Fan Page inspiration and undertaken the task of building a custom landing page for your business's Facebook presence, you may now be in the market for some features that will further engage your fans.

A nice feature of the modern social web is that it's modular. You can plug in and customize pre-made pieces of software (often created by other users or companies), and mix and match what works best for you without a lot of technical know-how. Facebook works the same way with apps.

Many Facebook apps are built for casual use, like the social games and quizzes you may see your friends using in their personal feeds. But there are quite a few apps that are ideal for a business Fan Page. These are useful for customizing your page with greater detail, showcasing your content from other social sites and getting more information from your customers. Here are five essential Facebook apps that your business may want to take for a spin.

1. Static FBML for Your Page Sidebar

We've already discussed how the Static FBML app can be used to make your Fan Page a unique destination. But this versatile plugin can also bring some interactivity to the column that appears on the left-hand side of your page.

Vertical, left-hand navigation is something users expect to find on most websites. They will be comfortable looking there for additional links, promotions and contact details. Moving a Static FBML box over to the left-hand column is a great way to exploit this valuable real estate. Here's how to do it.

If you haven't already done so, add the app to your Fan Page and make sure it's functioning as a ""Box"" rather than a ""Tab."" Add content to your box using standard HTML. Graphics cannot be uploaded to Facebook here, so you must reference them from a URL — likely one on your own hosted website or blog.

For a sidebar, think about adding some clean graphic buttons or icons that link out to other destinations your fans would be interested in, such as your company website, blog or Twitter account. This sidebar will be visible no matter what Fan Page tab your visitors are on, so consider using graphic elements that coincide with your existing logo and color scheme.







Once your content is added and saved, it will appear as a box on the ""Boxes"" tab. Head over there to ensure that your HTML has rendered properly. If so, click the ""Pencil"" in the top-right corner of the box and select ""Move To Wall Tab."" This will display your content in the left-hand navigation of your page.













Contests and giveaways are a great way to engage people with your brand, especially on the social web. A chance at some free stuff is one of the top reasons people follow and friend brands in the first place. The Promotions app makes it easy to build and publish a contest on Facebook in a way that is inherently social and shareable.

Promotions is different from many Facebook apps in that the content you create for it lives on the developer's website. This makes it a versatile tool, but you'll have to sign up for a free account at wildfireapp.com.

Once you create an account and connect the registered app to Facebook, the promotions you generate on WildFire will populate the tab on your Fan Page. Promotions are easily built through a step-by-step process. Provide the dates of the contest, the types of prizes, the fields for the entry form, specific parameters about contest entry and rules, and upload any additional artwork you want to include.







A nice advantage of having contest data centralized on WildFire is that it can be sourced out to other social networks, and even to your own company website. Any changes or additions you make to your promotions will dynamically update on all of the locations where your customers and fans find you on the web"

365,26,10908,"Women, Unite: Our Responsibility to One Another

One fall afternoon, my 16-year-old daughter rushed through the front door, dropped her backpack at her feet, and slid down to the floor in tears.

My first thought was that her best friend—a wild, impetuous thing—had been involved in a car accident. My second thought: She’d had her heart broken. I didn’t have time for a third thought because, before I knew it, I was on the floor beside her, her small, strong body trembling in my arms.

When she calmed down enough to speak, she filled me in on her afternoon. Soccer try-outs for her prestigious high school’s varsity team had been held that afternoon. She hadn’t performed poorly (she’d put on her first pair of cleats when she was three); she hadn’t gotten hurt. But several of the older girls had treated her with scorn. Others had ignored her entirely. These were girls with whom she’d shared sleepovers. Matinees. Gossip, wardrobes, birthday cakes, crushes. They were, my daughter thought, her lifelong friends.

She went to bed early, before I summoned the courage to tell her that friends in high school were mostly fickle; that, when she was older, her friends and colleagues would be loving, steadfast, loyal. I’d save it for morning, I told myself.

But the more I contemplated my spiel, the less convinced of it I became. Hadn’t I experienced the same derision as a grown woman? Hadn’t I endured friends who looked down at me for continuing my role at my corporate job when my daughter was born, and other friends who’d ridiculed me when I resigned and chose to become a stay-at-home mom instead? Hadn’t I been betrayed, shamed, and excluded from other grown women I counted on as my friends? Hadn’t the greater accomplishments of my life—motherhood, buying a home, promotions—been received with equal mixes of admiration and jealousy?

Yes, yes, and yes again.

At the core of the way my daughter was treated by her peers was this: The potential threat she posed to the other girls on the team. These older girls knew their chances. They knew they were at risk of losing their place on the team.

Deeper within that—which my daughter intuited even if she couldn’t properly articulate it—was something much more insidious: The competition that exists among women.

Competition is important, even essential. But playing fair is far more imperative. Competition taken too far is detrimental—dangerous, even.

CD Projekt S.A. () is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw, founded in May 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński. Iwiński and Kiciński were video game retailers before they founded the company, which initially acted as a distributor of foreign video games for the domestic market. The department responsible for developing original games, CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series, was formed in 2002. In 2008, CD Projekt launched the digital distribution service GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).

The company began by translating major Western video-game releases into Polish, collaborating with Interplay Entertainment for two Baldur's Gate games. CD Projekt was working on the PC version of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance when Interplay experienced financial difficulties. The game was cancelled and the company decided to reuse the code for their own video game. It became The Witcher, a video game based on the works of Andrzej Sapkowski.

After the release of The Witcher, CD Projekt worked on a console port called The Witcher: White Wolf; but development issues and increasing costs almost led the company to the brink of bankruptcy. CD Projekt later released The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015, with the latter winning various Game of the Year awards. The company's upcoming project is Cyberpunk 2077, an open-world role-playing game based on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop game system, for which it opened a new division in Wrocław.

A video game distribution service, GOG.com was established by CD Projekt to help players find old games. Its mission is to offer games free of digital rights management (DRM) to players and its service was expanded to cover new AAA and independent games. The company opposes DRM in video games, and hopes that free downloadable content becomes an industry standard. CD Projekt considers maintaining their independence one of their most important strategies. By September 2017, it was the largest publicly traded video game company in Poland, worth about 2.3 billion, and by 2020, had reached a valuation of, making it the second-largest video game industry company in Europe behind Ubisoft. CD Projekt joined WIG20, an index of the 20 largest companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, in March 2018.

According to Iwiński, although he enjoyed playing video games as a child they were scarce in Poland (which was in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence at the time).

To these people they're literally just free samples, and are most frequently treated as such. Developers do have something to lose, be it investor confidence (a lot of studios are heavily funded by VCs, who probably don't want to hear about any theft problems), a relationship with Apple (who would most likely prefer that developers discussed app DRM cracking and piracy privately), or the goodwill of the public, who aren't usually going to feel sympathy for a company anyway.

Most importantly, if developers do have a problem with piracy—say that, like PageOnce, they found themselves prominently featured on one of the more popular pirated app repositories—they can do something about it.

When an app is cracked, that is to say that its DRM has been stripped, and the app has been reduced to an unprotect.IPA file, ready for sideloading through a jailbreak utility. But in the middle of 2009, Apple introduced a system by which app developers could sell services or add-ons from within their apps. This was good way for paid apps to extend their profitability, and the in-app purchases were effectively unpirateable.

Then, in October, Apple changed the rules: In-app purchases were allowed in free applications as well, meaning that developers could provide free trial apps that could be upgraded to full versions by way of in-app purchases. Popular apps could consolidate their free and paid versions into one app, and in the process, make piracy nearly impossible. (Update: But not quite) After all, what's the point in cracking and bootlegging an app anyone can get for free?

Apple even says as much (albeit with no lack of redundancy): ""Using In App Purchase in your app can also help combat some of the problems of software piracy by allowing you to verify In App Purchases"

The Klinikum am Weissenhof is a psychiatric hospital in Weinsberg. It was opened in 1903 as a royal sanatorium on the public domain of Weißenhof.

History 
Toward the end of the 19th century the four existing public sanatoria for the mentally ill in Württemberg (in Zwiefalten, Winnental, Schussenried and Weißenau) were overcrowded. Numerous invalids had to be rejected and accommodated in ordinary hospitals or sent back to their hometowns, where they could not be treated properly. There were no psychiatric institutions in the north of Württemberg, which was particularly problematic for the mentally ill and their relatives of those regions, since they had to travel large distances in order to receive treatment.

In 1897/98 the federal state Wurttemberg wanted to build a fifth state owned psychiatric institute. The search for a suitable construction site started in the north of Wurtemberg. The site would have to be located in a quiet area on one hand, but at the same time it should be near a train station and a large town. Consequently, the public domain of Weißenhof, a century old estate, was chosen. It is situated only two kilometres away from the local train station of Weinsberg and six kilometres from the city of Heilbronn. On the 6th of July 1899 the chamber of representatives granted three million Mark for the construction of the institution. At the beginning the institution was supposed to accommodate 500 patients, which could be increased by 50 more patients upon the completion of the construction.

In the fall of 1900 the construction of the mental hospital began with the building of a water supply system. In March 1901 a park was created on a small hill above the Sulmtal about 1 kilometer north of Weinsberg. The park was located right next to the court buildings and was set up in a pavilion system covering several individual hospital wards. In the beginning the wards were strictly separated, the western half of the park was dedicated to male patients and the eastern half to female patients. The administration buildings were put up in the center of the park.  On the 23rd of November the first patients were admitted and in 1905 the sanatorium was filled to capacity. First director of the institution was Paul Kemmler. From 1913-1915 an institutional church was built in the north of the area and a small cemetery was set up next to it. However, today there are no funerals being held anymore.

Within the context of Aktion T4 in Nazi Germany, patients of the Weinsberg institute were transported to the  Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre where they were executed. Later on it was used as a Zwischenanstalt, a kind of temporary encampment, for the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre. The patients were placed there temporarily, awaiting their transport to Hadamar and their impending execution. From January 1940 till the end of 1941 a total of 908 patients were transported from Weisenberg to euthanasia centers. 426 people were patients directly from Weisenberg and 482 were patients from other hospitals.

These characteristics of limited potency, limited oral bioavailability and limited brain penetration decrease its potential for use as a therapeutic agent.
AICA riboside treatment has been reported to have beneficial effects in a number of experimental models of myocardial ischemia. In a dog model, in which pacing induced a profound progressive decline in wall thickening and endocardial blood flow and an increase in ST segment deviation of the intramyocardial EKG, AICA riboside markedly attenuated these changes to maintain contractile function>Young and Mullane, Am. J. Physio., in press (1991)!. In another dog model, in which ischemia was induced by coronary artery occlusion, AICA riboside was reported to be beneficial by significantly decreasing ischemia-induced arrhythmias and improving blood flow to the ischemic region of the myocardium (Gruber et al, Circulation 80 (5): 1400-1410 (1990)). An effect of AICA riboside to increase regional blood flow and maintain contractile function was also reported in a dog model of coronary embolization in which ischemia was induced by administration of microspheres directly into the coronary circulation (Takashima et al, Heart and Vessels 5 (Supplement 4): 41 (1990)). A potential consequence of this reported redistribution in blood flow by AICA riboside was said to be a reduction of infarct size (McAllister et al, Clinical Research 35: 303A (1987)).

377,3,29560,"Q:

What is the relative processing speed of manipulating data with XML or OOP techniques? (i.e. XProc or XSL vs C# or Java)

What is the difference in processing speed for executing a process using XML manipulation or using object-oriented representation?  In general, is it faster to maximize or minimize the reliance on XML for a process.  Let it be assumed that the code is highly optimized in either circumstance.
A simple example of what I am asking is which of the following would execute faster, when called from a C# web application, if the Thing in question were to represent the same qualified entity.
  //                            XSL CODE FRAGMENT
  <NewThings>
     <xsl:for-each select=""Things/Thing"">
        <xsl:copy-of select=""."" />
     </xsl:for-each>
  </NewThings>

or
  //                                C# Code Fragment
  void iterate(List<Thing> things){
      List<Thing> newThings = new List<Thing>();
      things.ForEach(t=>newThings.Add(t));
  }

A complex example of might be whether it is faster to manipulate a system of objects and functions in C# or a system of xml documents in an XProc pipeline.
Thanks a lot.

A:

Generally speaking, if you're only going to be using the source document's tree once, you're not going to gain much of anything by deserializing it into some specialized object model.  The cost of admission - parsing the XML - is likely to dwarf the cost of using it, and any increase in performance that you get from representing the parsed XML in something more efficient than an XML node tree is going to be marginal.
If you're using the data in the source document over and over again, though, it can make a lot of sense to parse that data into some more efficiently-accessible structure.  This is why XSLT has the xsl:key element and key() function:  looking an XML node up in a hash table can be so much faster than performing a linear search on a list of XML nodes that it was worth putting the capability into the language.
To address your specific example, iterating over a List<Thing> is going to perform at the same speed as iterating over a List<XmlNode>.  What will make the XSLT slower is not the iteration.  It's the searching, and what you do with the found nodes.  Executing the XPath query Things/Thing iterates through the child elements of the current node, does a string comparison to check each element's name, and if the element matches, it iterates through that element's child nodes and does another string comparison for each.  (Actually, I don't know for a fact that it's doing a string comparison.  For all I know, the XSLT processor has hashed the names in the source document and the XPath and is doing integer comparisons of hash values.)   That's the expensive part of the operation, not the actual iteration over the resulting node set.  
Additionally, most anything that you do with the resulting nodes in XSLT is going to involve linear searches through a node set.  Accessing an object's property in C# doesn't.  Accessing  MyThing.MyProperty is going to be faster than getting at it via <xsl:value-of select='MyProperty'/>.
Generally, that doesn't matter, because parsing XML is expensive whether you deserialize it into a custom object model or an XmlDocument.  But there's another case in which it may be relevant:  if the source document is very large, and you only need a small part of it.
When you use XSLT, you essentially traverse the XML twice.  First you create the source document tree in memory, and then the transform processes this tree.  If you have to execute some kind of nasty XPath like //*[@some-attribute='"

381,3,10665,"] because the wording of these policies is different than the standard CGL policy examined in Powerine I and Foster-Gardner. Finally, the Court of Appeal opined that the Central National policies are different in scope and purpose from the standard primary CGL policy in that they expressly provide umbrella coverage which can operate to ""`fill any gaps'"" in higher level primary coverage.
We granted Central National's petition for review. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Central National have been filed by the London Market Insurers and the Complex Insurance Claims Litigation Association. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Powerine have been filed by ITT Industries, Inc., and United Policyholders/Richard Giller.

DISCUSSION

1. Issue preclusion and law of the case
At the threshold we address Central National's procedural argument that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the prior writ proceeding culminating in Powerine I, which granted the London Market insurers summary judgment on certain excess/umbrella policies issued by those insurers to Powerine, establishes law of the case and, under principles of issue preclusion, bars Powerine from here revisiting the matter of coverage for nonlawsuit expenditures under Central National's express/umbrella policies. (See, e.g., Interinsurance Exchange of the Auto. Club v. Superior Court (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 177, 181, 257 Cal.Rptr. 37 [""`[A] former judgment... is a collateral estoppel on issues which were raised, even though some factual matters or legal arguments which could have been presented were not.' (7 Witkin [Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Judgment] § 257, p. 696, original italics.)""]; Kowis v. Howard (1992) 3 Cal.4th 888, 894, 12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250 [law of the case doctrine applicable to writ proceedings]; McCutchen v. City of Montclair (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1144, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 95 [doctrine of issue preclusion applicable where issue in present proceeding is identical to one actually litigated and necessarily decided in prior proceeding].)
This procedural argument was considered and rejected by the Court of Appeal on the following basis:
""Central National insists that our [now superseded] decision in Powerine I... precludes Powerine from arguing that the scope of coverage here is not limited to money ordered by a court. Observing that in our Powerine I decision we mentioned one umbrella and four excess policies issued by the [Certain Underwriters] insurers in addition to the primary policy, Central National asserts that that decision `definitively resolved the identical issue,' namely, that `no coverage exists for administratively imposed costs under [the insurer's] excess and umbrella policies covering damages that the insured is legally obligated to pay.' Central National argues any references we made to the umbrella policy in that opinion is law of the case and is binding on Powerine inasmuch as Powerine did not appeal from that issue and the issue was not addressed by the Supreme Court in Powerine I. Not so.
*570 ""First, we stated clearly in our [superseded] opinion that `we are only concerned with the primary policy issued to Powerine by Certain Underwriters'... and `we have no reason to reach or consider the several excess policies which Certain Underwriters also issued over a 20-year period....' Such statements render any comments made about the secondary policies pure obiter dictum. Second, we quoted from the language of the excess and umbrella policies in that opinion.... The language is materially different from the language at issue here because, inter alia, the policies' language does not `more fully define' the term `damages' by reference to another clause in the policy. For these reasons, our opinion in Powerine I is neither law of the case nor binding on Powerine for anything involving the excess or umbrella policies there.""
We do not necessarily agree with the Court of Appeal that statements made in its now superseded opinion in the prior writ proceeding (Powerine I) respecting the London Market Insurers' excess/umbrella policies were ""pure obiter dict"

O secretário da Receita Federal, Marcos Cintra, afirmou em entrevista ao jornal O Estado de S. Paulo que alertou o presidente sobre acessos irregulares aos seus dados em janeiro. A consulta da Receita ao Serpro sobre a mudança no sistema dos rastros digitais ocorreu em fevereiro.

Um dos questionamentos foi sobre a possibilidade de reduzir de 16 para 8 anos o período de guarda dos ""logs"" a dados de contribuintes. Outro se referia ao sigilo de acessos feitos por auditores lotados na área de inteligência a partir de uma nova plataforma em desenvolvimento no Fisco, o ReceitaData.

O pedido gerou surpresa em técnicos que trabalham com a ferramenta. A medida foi vista como uma forma de mascarar os ""logs"" daqueles lotados na Copei e suas ramificações.

Esse grupo já é protegido por um ""manto de invisibilidade"". Portaria da Receita prevê que os ""logs"" desses servidores não podem ser consultados por membros da Auditoria e Corregedoria do Fisco, responsáveis pelo monitoramento e análise de irregularidades no órgão.

Apenas a cúpula do Fisco (o Secretário da Receita Federal, o corregedor-geral, o corregedor-geral adjunto e mais uma pessoa indicada por esses) podem ter acesso às consultas feitas pelos investigadores da Receita.

O sistema responsável por relatório de ""logs"" é o DW-LEL, que será substituído por funções do ReceitaData.

Fontes da Receita afirmam, contudo, que mesmo o DW-LEL contém informações defasadas, podendo não mostrar todos os acessos feitos sobre informações de um contribuinte.

The interpretation of an insurance contract, including whether it is ambiguous, is a legal determination subject to de novo review.  Truehart v. Blandon, 884 F.2d 223, 226 (5th Cir.1989).   Therefore, we must examine Condition 15 and Condition 16 in order to determine if an ambiguity exists.


25
Condition 15 is written for the sole benefit of the borrower.   The policy specifies additional beneficiaries in Condition 16 which states that the policy provisions are written for the benefit of Verex and City Federal.   Neither condition is mutually exclusive.   However, if these two provisions create an ambiguity it is to be construed against Verex.  National Union Fire Ins. Co., 811 S.W.2d at 555.   In any event, we find no ambiguity created by Conditions 15 and 16.   We also find that the insurance contract was actually made, in part, for the benefit of Palma.


26
Finally, we must determine if Verex and City Federal intended the contract to benefit Palma.   The intent of the contracting parties is discerned from the four corners of the instrument.   See Talman, 924 F.2d at 1350 (""It is the intention and purpose of the contracting parties, as disclosed within the four corners of the instrument, which should control"") (internal citation omitted).


27
One Texas court has stated that ""[w]here a stranger contends that it was intended that the provisions of a contract should inure to his benefit such intention must be clearly apparent.   If there is any doubt concerning the intent in this regard as it appears from the contract itself, such doubt should be construed against such intent.""  Republic Nat'l Bank v. Nat'l Bankers Life Ins. Co., 427 S.W.2d 76, 80 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1968, writ ref'd n.r.e.);   see Talman, 924 F.2d at 1351 (quoting Republic Nat'l Bank ).   Palma is not a stranger to the insurance contract between Verex and City Federal;  she is specifically identified as the borrower in the contract itself.   Consequently, the Talman decision does not affect our analysis.


28
The contract for insurance was clearly intended, in part, to benefit Palma.5  Consequently, the three elements having been satisfied, we find that Palma is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract for mortgage insurance entered into between Verex and City Federal.

388,14,13119,"Constraints such as those offered by let and const are a powerful way of making code easier to understand. Try to accrue as many of these constraints as possible in the code you write. The more declarative constraints that limit what a piece of code could mean, the easier and faster it is for humans to read, parse, and understand a piece of code in the future.

You know all of this just by reading the const declaration statement and without scanning for other references to that variable.

In addition to the signals offered by let, the const keyword indicates that a variable binding can’t be reassigned. This is a strong signal. You know what the value is going to be; you know that the binding can’t be accessed outside of its immediately containing block, due to block scoping; and you know that the binding is never accessed before declaration, because of TDZ semantics.

Note that this means that the variable binding can’t change, but it doesn’t mean that the value itself is immutable or constant in any way. A const binding that references an object can’t later reference a different value, but the underlying object can indeed mutate.

The const statement is block-scoped as well, and it follows TDZ semantics too. The upside is that const bindings can only be assigned during declaration.

A let statement indicates that a variable can’t be used before its declaration, due to the Temporal Dead Zone rule. This isn’t a convention, it is a fact: if we tried accessing the variable before its declaration statement was reached, the program would fail. These statements are block-scoped and not function-scoped; this means we need to read less code in order to fully grasp how a let variable is used.

Granted, there’s more rules to a const declaration than to a var declaration: block-scoped, TDZ, assign at declaration, no reassignment. Whereas var statements only signal function scoping. Rule-counting, however, doesn’t offer a lot of insight. It is better to weigh these rules in terms of complexity: does the rule add or subtract complexity? In the case of const, block scoping means a narrower scope than function scoping, TDZ means that we don’t need to scan the scope backwards from the declaration in order to spot usage before declaration, and assignment rules mean that the binding will always preserve the same reference.

The more constrained statements are, the simpler a piece of code becomes. As we add constraints to what a statement might mean, code becomes less unpredictable. This is one of the biggest reasons why statically typed programs are generally easier to read than dynamically typed ones. Static typing places a big constraint on the program writer, but it also places a big constraint on how the program can be interpreted, making its code easier to understand.

With these arguments in mind, it is recommended that you use const where possible, as it’s the statement that gives us the least possibilities to think about.

if (condition) { const isReady = true }

When const isn’t an option, because the variable needs to be reassigned later, we may resort to a let statement. Using let carries all the benefits of const, except that the variable can be reassigned. This may be necessary in order to increment a counter, flip a boolean flag, or to defer initialization.

“No religious person should agree to euthanasia.”

Do you agree?

Both religious people and non-religious people often regard euthanasia with a sense foreboding, generally because it is not always obvious as to what it entails. A religious person has a set of moral standards to in which to adhere to and these “rules” are generally seen as more extreme that that of an atheist. Different religions, for example Christianity and Islam have contrasting views on the matter although they sometimes overlap.

Christians take a more relative view on euthanasia than Muslims do, still believing that it is wrong, although considering the quality of life as an important factor in the decision. There are examples of euthanasia within the Bible; “Stand over me and kill me…so I killed him.” (Samuel 1:9-10). This shows that although it is not seen as acceptable to many Christians, there are exceptions to the rules.

Both religions see life as a gift from God and therefore should be sacred; this is where the issue of “Sanctity of life” arises. When we talk about sanctity of life, we mean that life is not to be treated badly or discarded of thoughtlessly. But if death was not regarded as a bad thing, then the objections to euthanasia will automatically disappear and the idea of “sanctity of life” will not be as relevant as it currently is.

Christians believe that relieving someone’s suffering is a good thing, as long as it isn’t done to intentionally cause death and this is known as double effect.

Muslims take a much more absolute view concerning euthanasia. They believe that all human life is sacred because it is given by Allah, humans should not interfere with this process. Allah decides when the time is right to take someone’s life. “No one dies unless Allah permits.” (Qu’ran 3:145) Muslims believe that any “attack” on life is an attack on Allah, the second greatest sin in Islam.

The Shari’ah law states that all forms of euthanasia are forbidden although later states that that the withdrawal of life support/treatment is acceptable. It is not completely clear as to what is right or wrong as there is a contradiction in their beliefs.

I personally think that being religious should have an impact on your thoughts towards euthanasia as you have decided to follow a religion so should therefore adhere to the beliefs that coincide with it.

There are contradictions to what is said, especially in Islam, so I think that each case should be judged upon it’s own merits although the religious beliefs should still be taken into consideration. Agreeing to euthanasia if you are religious is a hard decision to make especially if you want to relieve an unbearable pain of a love one. So therefore I do not agree with the statement “No religious person should agree to euthanasia.”

THIRST 박쥐

This moody, atmospheric vampire movie stars Song Kang-ho (THE HOST, SECRET SUNSHINE) as a priest so devoted to healing the sick that he volunteers as a test subject for an experimental drug that ends up giving him a taste for human blood. His holy nature keeps him from draining human victims—he drinks from transfusion bags at the hospital where he volunteers—but he is unable to overcome the carnal urges his new sustenance brings and embarks on a torrid affair with a friend’s wife, who soon develops a bloody thirst of her own. Park Chan-wook blends suspense, humor and imagery that is as disturbing as it is beautiful in this offbeat story of a man of God earnestly struggling with desires both earthly and infernal. “A brilliant and gruesome work of cinematic invention as well as a passionate and painful human love story.” – Andrew O’Hehir, Salon.com.

How to compute geodesic area in GeoDjango?

I have some polygons which can be anywhere in the world. I would like to compute their areas.
The GeoDjango docs for GEOSGeometry.area don't specify whether it is geometric or geodesic area, but given that GEOSGeometry.distance() says that ""GEOS does not perform a spherical calculation even if the SRID specifies a geographic coordinate system"", I suspect that it is a simple geometric area.
I'm willing to write a little code, but the shorter the better, of course.
We do have a working geodesic distance function already.

A:

if you use PostGIS Geography Type for your table, you can calculate your area as you calculate on the plane surface.

The geography type provides native support for spatial features
  represented on ""geographic"" coordinates (sometimes called ""geodetic""
  coordinates, or ""lat/lon"", or ""lon/lat""). Geographic coordinates are
  spherical coordinates expressed in angular units (degrees).

creating geography(not geometry) table:
CREATE TABLE mypoly ( 
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(64),
    the_geom GEOGRAPHY(POINT,4326)
  );

hereafter is that using psycopg2 for reaching postgis table and querying some sql with ST_Area.

ST_Area — Returns the area of the surface if it is a polygon or
  multi-polygon. For ""geometry"" type area is in SRID units. For
  ""geography"" area is in square meters.

in your view.py, write this code:

He is the second Council member to leave the body in two months — former Soviet dissident Andrei Piontkovsky quit [ru] in early April. Katz said he was happy to have participated as long as he did — especially in the election and debate process last fall — but that the Council was essentially crippled from the start by its “ideological curiae,” groups of representatives that were voted through according to ideological quotas for liberals, nationalists, and leftists. Katz complained [ru]:

the curiae allowed certain people into the C[oordinating] C[ouncil] who are very different in their views, approaches and goals from both the main part of the Coordinating Council and from its supporters.

398,17,21688," 1999, comprises a plate into which a screw can be screwed multiaxially. The multiaxial aspect has, among other things, the advantage that the screwing-in directions are no longer defined by the plate itself. In this way, depending on the nature of the material, it is no longer essential for a screw to be screwed into a bone perpendicular to the longitudinal extent of the plate. For this purpose, the through-bores are additionally provided with a spherical element, which is mounted so as to be at least partially rotatable within the through-bore. This spherical element is arranged captive within the through-bore and interacts with the screw head of the screw that is to be screwed in. The spherical element orients itself depending on the position and thus establishes a force-fit and form-fit connection with the screw head and the plate.
Another multiaxial design of a plate, which interacts with a specially designed screw, is set out in US 20050165400 A (FERNANDEZ ALBERTO A, UY) Jan. 26, 2004. The orthopedic fixation system comprises a plate, which likewise has one or more through-bores. A screw is also provided, which consists of a screw head and of a screw shank. The screw head is specially designed and has a thread that interacts with threads provided at least partially in the through-bores.
To allow a screw to be screwed in obliquely (and thus not perpendicular) to the longitudinal extent of the plate, provision is made for the through-bore to be specially designed. The through-bores have an hourglass-shaped cross section. This means that, seen in the screwing-in direction, the diameter of the through-bore narrows from an initially wide diameter until a defined plane is reached. Starting from this plane, the diameter of the through-bore widens out again.
The through-bore formed in this way has a thread, which interacts with the thread of the screw head. The thread is specially designed and constitutes a so-called cutting thread. This means that, when the screw head is being screwed in, a mechanical cutting process takes place between said thread and the screw head. To strengthen this cutting process and thereby achieve a wedging of the screw head within the through-bore, such that undesired loosening of plate and screw at a later point is no longer possible, cutting elements preferably made of another material are provided within the through-bore. These cutting elements are let into the circumference of the through-bore and bring about a deformation when the screw is screwed into the through-bore. By means of the spherical shape of the screw head, it is possible to choose a large number of angle degrees that deviate from the line perpendicular to the longitudinal extent of the plate.
DE 202004015912U (AESCULAP AG) Dec. 9, 2004 also discloses a fixation system that consists principally of a plate and of a bone screw. The bone screw itself has a shank, which defines a longitudinal axis, and a screw head, which can be brought into engagement with a bone screw seat. A securing element for securing the connection of bone screw and bone plate is additionally provided, the bone screw being able to be brought from a position of engagement, in which the bone screw is held on the bone plate, to a release position.
The through-bores within the bone plate are preferably oval in shape, thereby permitting mult"
399,11,29416,"""Slap Bet"" is the ninth episode in season 2 of the popular sitcomHow I Met Your Mother. The episode, originally titled ""Robin Sparkles"", first aired on November 20, 2006. The episode received highly positive reviews and features in several lists of the best How I Met Your Mother episodes in the series. The episode led to two recurring jokes and storylines in the show: ""Robin Sparkles"", Robin's teenage pop star career, and the Slap Bet, in which Marshall slapped Barney at various points throughout the series.

Contents

Ted, Marshall, Lily, and Barney find out that Robin never goes to malls and refuses to explain why. Marshall posits that Robin was married in a mall in Canada, because whenever asked about Canada, Robin only talks about her friend who got married way too young. Barney, however, believes that the secret is related to pornography. They agree to a slap bet, where the winner of the bet slaps the loser as hard as he can, and appoint Lily as the slap bet commissioner.

Ted begins to worry that Robin is married. Ted pesters Robin to reveal if she really got married in Canada. After trying to avoid the issue, Robin tells Ted that she got married in a mall, after which her husband moved to Hong Kong without getting a divorce. Ted promises to keep it a secret, but tells the gang after Lily begs him. Marshall slaps Barney.

Law student Marshall searches a legal database, and tells Ted that there is no record of a marriage license for Robin in Canada. After asking her various questions about her wedding, Ted confronts Robin and she admits she is not married, but finds out that Ted told Marshall her supposed secret.

A group of terrorists led by an anarchist named Monica Habler (Lilli Carati) and comprised of Diana (Marina Daunia), Betty (Artemia Terenziani) and Erica (Ada Pometti) make a daring escape from a women’s prison. Before they can get into the getaway car, a rusted-out Citroen driven by Monica’s brother Pierre, some undercover cops show up. A shootout happens, the cops are killed and Pierre is injured but they make their escape… until their car winds up in a ditch.

Luckily for them, a busload of women’s tennis players happens to pass by and soon enough, the girls are taken hostage and the bus has been commandeered. One of the players, Terry (Ines Pellegrini), knows of a house nearby owned by a friend of hers whose father is a judge. They decide to hold up there for a while, but soon learn that the judge (Filippo De Gara) is home, which causes its own set of problems. Monica forces the judge to take her into town to get antibiotics to help Pierre, and soon after their return they force one of the tennis players, Claudine (Dirce Funari), to treat him. This leads to Diana, a lesbian, forcing herself on her while perpetually horny Erica rapes Marco (Franco Ferrer), the bus driver. As one of the hostages, Terry (Ines Pellegrini) tries to convince Monica that she’s on her side, the militant, heavyset Betty creates her own series of problems as hostage Anna (Zora Kerowa) hopes to come up with a plan to get them all out alive.

A fairly sleazy slice of rapid-fire exploitation, Escape From Women’s Prison doesn’t actually take place in a prison at all, so those hoping for WIP-styles shenanigans may be disappointed. Or maybe not. The judge’s house basically serves as the de facto house of detention here, with the hostages made into prisoners and the escaped convicts turned into the stereotypically abusive guards. If you shift the roles around a bit and don’t mind the change in location, the movie winds up delivering the same kind of cheap thrills that you’d get from a typical ‘chicks in chains’ movie of the era – horniness abounds, there’s forced lesbianism and there’s some moderate violence. The film also works as a sort of home invasion picture like Last House On The Beach or Last House On The Left, sharing traits with those two better known films.

Either way, if you’re into trashy Italian exploitation films, you’ll probably get a kick out of this one. It’s also neat to see some familiar faces pop up here. The lovely Lilli Carati of Fernando De Lio’s To Be Twenty is quite good in her part as the ringleader behind all of this, and it’s cool to see New York Ripper’s Zora Kerowa pop in a supporting role. Ada Pometti, who also appeared in Fango Bollente (aka The Savage Three), is solid in her part. Ines Pellgrino, who had a small part in Salo and a larger part in Eyeball, is good in one of the film’s more interesting roles, giving a bit more dramatic weight to her part. Filippo De Gara, who had small parts in The Tough Ones and Investigation Of Above Suspicion, is also quite good as the judge.

404,22,27111,"Tonight we had a little incident in our kitchen. I have been home alone this week because Mark is on a business trip. When I am home alone, dinner tends to be even less structured than when mark is here. We generally try to have a “family dinner”, although this notion with kids at these ages is almost laughable, but still, we do try. But when I am home alone, well, who knows who is going to be eating what and when. Tonight Eliana had already eaten because she was clearly hungry early. Max did not want to eat anything and I only started making my dinner when Eliana was already eating. By the time I sat down to eat, both kids had eaten but then decided that they both needed to sit on my lap while I tried to eat, thus having to juggle two children, a knife (just a butter knife, don’t worry, this isn’t involved in the incident) a fork and couple water glasses, one of which ended upside down in the chair next to me. None of this made up ‘the incident’, I am only setting the scene of loving chaos that the incident took place in.

The kids have a small child’s table, which is small and square, big enough for one child to use. This table happened to be sitting close to where I was sitting so somehow that table was pulled over to the table and both kids ended up standing on it. It is extremely stable, so I wasn’t worried about that. But then Eliana fell off. The table isn’t very high, but we have concrete floors, so I, of course, panicked. My mommy reflexes kicked in and I caught her leg just in time to keep her head from hitting the ground. It was like a cartoon where the character is free falling off of a cliff and then whatever is wrapped around their leg stops them an inch from the ground, and then there is that moment of still, just before they get sprung in the other direction. But this wasn’t so funny because in my reflex to catch Eliana, I knocked Max off of the same table. He is almost 4 and anyone with kids knows, a kid who is 4 falls differently than a kid who is 1 1/2. Eliana was diving towards the floor with her head while Max has natural reflexes to protect himself and he ended up falling on his bum. But also at the very instant that Eliana fell and I reached out to grab her, something snapped inside of me and anger spewed from within – anger towards myself for having let them stand there on the table like that. So, in the most bizarre fashion, I started spewing “God Damn It!” (sorry to all Christians – I’m just reporting here what spewed) over and over again. I was simultaneously saving one kid, knocking one kid over and reprimanding myself. This was our incident. This included the aftermath of Eliana sitting safely, albeit scared out of her wits and screaming, on my lap, and Max sitting on the floor next to"

At the early 2 h time point no difference in the surface coverage of the wild type and the Δ*dns*Δ*xds* mutant was observed for both nutrient conditions investigated ([Fig. S2](#SD1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}). Thus, the Δ*dns*Δ*xds* mutant showed no obvious change during initial attachment. At the later time point, the wild type biofilm showed the characteristic architecture of a mature three-dimensional biofilm with pillars of cells separated by fluid-filled channels as previously described by others ([Fig. 2](#fig02){ref-type=""fig""}) ([@b118]; [@b121]; [@b129]; [@b130]). In contrast, the biofilm of the Δ*dns*Δ*xds* mutant appeared to be very thick and compact, covering the entire surface of the flow cell without any visible fluid-filled channels ([Fig. 2](#fig02){ref-type=""fig""}). The differences in the structural parameters of the biofilms were also confirmed by quantitative analysis using COMSTAT, which revealed a significant threefold increase in biomass as well as a significant 30% greater maximum thickness of the Δ*dns*Δ*xds* mutant biofilms compared with the wild type ([Fig. 2C](#fig02){ref-type=""fig""}). Additionally, the roughness and average diffusion distance were analysed ([Fig. 2C](#fig02){ref-type=""fig""}). The biofilm roughness provides a measure for the thickness variation of the biofilm and is an indicator for biofilm heterogeneity ([@b45]). The average diffusion distance indicates the shortest average distance from a pixel containing biomass to a pixel without biomass. This is an indicator for distances over which nutrients and substrate components have to diffuse to the bacteria ([@b125]). The Δ*dns*Δ*xds* mutant biofilms exhibited a significant lower roughness, but a significant higher average diffusion distance compared with the wild type. Similar results were obtained using 2% LB broth ([Fig. S3](#SD1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}). These results confirmed that the biofilm architecture of the Δ*dns*Δ*xds* mutant showed less heterogeneity in combination with higher density. Hence, the double mutant biofilm lacked the typical structural details present in wild type biofilms. The biofilm morphology and structural parameters of the single mutants ranged between the wild type and the double mutant, strengthening the idea that the loss of one extracellular nuclease can be partially compensated by the remaining"

OPINION OF THE COURT
LARSEN, Justice.
The issue presented in this appeal is whether the earth movement exclusion in an ""all-risk"" homeowner's insurance policy bars coverage for damage (loss) due to natural events only, or natural and man-made events.
Appellants, Charles A. Steele and Patricia M. Steele, own a home located in Scott Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Appellants purchased an ""all-risk"" homeowner's insurance policy from Appellee, Statesman Insurance Company (Statesman) which was in effect at the time of the loss described hereinafter.
On March 13, 1988, the Steeles sustained damage to their home when the hillside in their rear-yard collapsed. At that time the Steeles' rear-yard neighbor was engaged in construction on their property. The collapse occurred because the rear-yard neighbor overbuilt, overloaded, and overburdened the hillside shared by both properties. The Steeles reported the damage (loss) to Statesman in compliance with the conditions of their homeowner's insurance policy. Statesman refused coverage due to the following earth movement exclusion:
We do not cover loss resulting directly or indirectly from:

(2) explosion other than the explosion of a volcano; or
(3) breakage of glass or safety glazing material; ensues and then we will pay only for the ensuing loss.
This exclusion does not apply to loss by theft.

413,29,25392,"Cross Timbers Water Supply: Where Did We Come From?

Fifty three years ago in 1964 five local residents joined together to form the Bartonville Water Supply Corporation. These were local farmers, ranchers and interested residents. Ray Robertson, R.H. Burgess, Marvin Ellis, A.M. Alley and W.J Brown incorporated the water supply corporation under Texas law for the purposes of “furnishing a water supply for general farm use and domestic purposes to individuals residing in the rural community of Bartonville, Texas, and the surrounding rural areas.” Reflecting its original size, the corporation agreed to keep a reserve fund of $2,500 for emergency repairs, obsolescence of equipment and for making up any deficiencies in revenue for loan payments.

A lot has changed in the last 53 years. From 139 members in 1965 we have grown to a current commitment to serve over 2,700 members. We have remained a member owned Non-Profit Corporation with every member owning a share of the Corporation. Under our designation as a retail public utility, the Water Supply Corporation is exempt from property taxes, Federal Income Taxes and Texas Franchise Taxes. Our annual budget now runs $3 million per year. Our highest expense is for water which costs over $1.2 million per year for ground water from Upper Trinity Regional Water authority. Our electric bill to pump water from our wells and boost it to the elevated tank is over $200,000 per year. We also pay fees required by the North Texas Groundwater Conservation District for water pumped from our well.

The Corporation is managed by the Board of Directors who are elected from the members. There are 2 or 3 Board positions up for election each year. The Board members are elected by the general membership at the Annual Membership Meeting every April. Board members receive no remuneration for their service, no discounts on water nor other special consideration.

The original infrastructure utilized pumps and pressure vessels to provide pressure to customers. Not everyone received adequate pressure and those at higher elevations often had to consider second floor showers as the “shower of last resort.” The building of the elevated water tower in Double Oak in 1996 remedied that situation with adequate pressure throughout the Bartonville Water Supply Corp territory. That territory is defined by our CCN (Certificate of Convenience and Necessity) which was assigned by the Texas Public Utilities Commission in 1979. Under that CCN we were assigned an exclusive territory in which we are obligated to serve all customers who request water service. As a Water Supply Corporation we operate under the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Rules and Regulations for Public Water Systems and must ensure a safe and adequate supply of water to our members for domestic use. While the Water Supply Corporation is required to furnish water for domestic use, we are not charged with the responsibility to supply water for fire hydrants. Planning for the future, we began requiring fire hydrant type flush valves in new developments as early as 1986. In 2009 the Corporation Board of Directors committed to supply water for fire hydrants as supplies allow and authorized construction of a 750,000 gallon elevated water tank to fill that need. Although construction of the tank has been delayed by legal actions, the Corporation intends to fulfill its promise to supply water for firefighting as soon as possible.

From our humble beginnings we have grown to have more than 90 miles of underground pipelines, 7 deep wells, 9 high pressure booster pumps, 5 sanitation facilities, 4 million gallons of ground tank water storage, the aforementioned 500,000 gallon elevated water storage tank and a contract with the Upper Trinity Regional Water Authority for additional ground water. In 2013 we changed our name from Bartonville Water Supply Corporation to Cross Timbers Water Supply Corporation to better identify our scope. Our service area includes not only Bartonville, but Double Oak, Copper Canyon, unincorporated areas of Denton County as well as portions of Highland Village and Flower Mound.

While our service area has not changed since being authorized by Public Utilities Commission, the communities we serve have undergone tremendous change and growth. What was originally rural has transformed into a more suburban area with higher density housing, commercial businesses and water demands many times those originally contemplated. The original members used a few thousand gallons of water per month while our current average customer uses 14,000 gallons per month. That varies from an average of 7,000 gallons"

Evan Soltas is hoping that President Obama’s appointment of Janet Yellen signifies a new administration commitment to jobs and economic growth. Unfortunately, Soltas seems to be one of those folks who is convinced that our failures over the past five years have much to do with a monetary policy that has been insufficiently “accommodative”, and he strongly suggests that the national plague of mass joblessness and stagnation could be alleviated if the Fed would only do more aggressive quantitative easing without political pressure to taper prematurely.

It’s a sad fact that, five years into his presidency, Obama has shown little interest in nudging monetary policy toward growth — or even just appointing growth-minded policy makers. Yellen changes that. She has been outspoken about the need for the central bank to support a U.S. economic recovery with accommodative monetary policy — and, in particular, to reduce unemployment. Meanwhile, Obama has been an outspoken, if not well-argued, advocate for the hawkish view that continued easing creates risks of financial bubbles and instability.

Those comments aren’t at all out of place in the Obama administration’s view of monetary policy. You can hear his emphasis on risks that would cause the Fed to tighten. It’s strange to see the president, who you would think wants the economy to grow, so ready to throw away his best option to realize that outcome. And it is a particularly egregious error when, as Obama knows, Republican opposition means fiscal policy cannot ride to the rescue. With"

419,26,7624,"Digital signal processing is well known and is used in a variety of products. A general purpose computer chip, commonly called a CPU (an acronym for “Central Processing Unit”) may be configured to operate on data representative of a “signal” and those operations may correspond to meaningful operation upon that signal, such as, for example, to find the maximum excursion of that signal, or to find the maximum frequency component present in that signal. The word “signal” is used to indicate that the data represent a continuously varying parameter, such as a sound pressure or image brightness or other parameter that varies with time. Data representing the height of trees growing in a parkland is not a signal in this sense—it has no variation with time, it represents a snapshot of a particular height of the trees.
Some meaningful operations on signals are computationally expensive—many primitive operations are needed to complete the operation on the data. Fourier analysis (decomposition into frequency components) is one such example. For this reason special purpose processing elements have been designed—these are CPUs that are specialized to process data representing a signal and include hardware to simplify or optimize what would otherwise be time consuming operations on a general purpose CPU. Such specialized CPU's are referred to as DSP's an acronym for Digital Signal Processor.
In the detailed operation of a DSP device we may identify a further distinction: those DSP's devices that operate continuously and those that operate in a batch mode. For example, in performing a common operation called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) a section of the digital signal is taken into an input buffer—a temporary store of a number of signal samples. An operation, typically of many steps, then proceeds to operate upon the section of the data present in the input buffer, finally creating a second collection of data elements that can be considered an output buffer of data now representing the frequency decomposition of the signal data present in the input buffer. Thus, this DSP has completed an operation in a batch mode—it is only necessary that the batch operation upon the input buffer be compete before a second input buffer has filled—the faster that the batch operation proceeds the better, since the DSP processor then has time to complete other potentially useful operations. Contrast this FFT example of a batch mode operation with the operation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. This is a signal processing method well know in the art, where a weighted summation of the input signal over a period of time is created to represent an output signal. The output signal has a lower frequency variation than the input. For example, a weigh scale in a supermarket checkout may be a source of a digital data signal. It may output a digital number representing the weight on the pan at a rate of 100 samples (measurements) per second. If these digital numbers were displayed they would flicker at up to 100 times a second since the measurement returned is not identical to the 1/10 of a gram each time. This would be disconcerting and it is desirable to present a number to the customer that is stable, free from flicker. To accomplish this, a FIR filter may be used. The FIR filter takes the last 10 measurements and sums them, then presents to the display 1/10th of the sum. Each time a new number is available from the input digital signal the old number, taken ten samples ago, is lost and the new sample is added. Therefore, a new output of 1/10th the sum of the last 10 inputs is available 100-times a second and this new output data has fewer flickers, less variation, since it is the average of the last 10 results.
This weigh scale FIR example shows a second and distinct mode of operation from the FFT example: specifically, the weigh scale FIR operates continually, it does not operate in batch mode. It is useful to note that it accepts a stream of input data samples and creates a stream of output data samples. Significantly, there is no difference in operation at each presentation of new data—there is no “control state” in the operation of the FIR. There is significant “control state” in the operation of the FFT. The presence of a complex control state may be taken to distinguish a Stream Signal Processor (SSP) from a more generic DSP: the SSP is executing the identical operation (or operations) per new input data sample, the non-stream processing DSP is executing a complex sequence of operations, possibly not even at the rate of new input data. In the known art the generic non-stream processing DSP has a “program counter"

422,19,28827," In recent years, the DPP leadership has been eager to
distance itself from its single-issue party image: in one of her recent weekly
newsletters, Kjærsgaard had even acknowledged that the political debate had
moved on after the 2008-09 crisis, determining a shift in Danish politics from
value-based issues towards those dealing with the consequences of the financial
crisis in Denmark and the EU. Claiming that it was in the 'DPP's DNA' to deal
with issues that 'affect and interest people', Kjærsgaard asked: why should the
party ‘desperately try to – say - put forward the question of judges wearing
the Muslim veil’ when there are ‘other things voters are now concerned about?’

One
could argue that the DPP has simply understood the rules of the game. The change
of party leadership was also strategic and took place earlier than expected;
Kristian Thulesen Dahl is considered, both within and outside the DPP, as an
expert on financial issues and the public deficit (his nickname is ‘talknuser’
– 'the number-crusher'), a valuable asset in a period of economic turmoil. However,
the Christmas tree story shows that this party wouldn't hesitate to refocus on 'values' if the political climate was right.

DPP
members weren't the only ones to react to the Christmas tree story. In an interview on the nationwide TV channel, Conservative
MP Tom Behnke called the decision of the housing board ‘intolerant and a sign
that integration efforts have failed so badly that Danish traditions are
instantly removed and replaced by Muslim traditions when Muslims get a
majority', adding he now feared some people wanted to turn Denmark into a
Muslim country.

In
the columns of the Berlingske daily, Karen Jespersen, a well-known
Liberal figure on questions of migration and integration in Denmark, called the
Christmas tree affair a 'case in point', demonstrating how radical Muslims were
overtaking more moderate positions. For Jespersen, this was the result of the laissez-faire
politics promoted by the centre-left - particularly the Social Liberals, whom
he claimed were ready to give up on everything when
it came to Danish culture and cultural differences.

'If they do not want our Christmas, why should they get our Christmas
charity?'

The
culturalist view is simple: the success of an immigrant's integration crucially
depends on whether his or her cultural background is compatible with the values
of the majority. This logic is frequently used in Danish politics today, even
to reinforce exclusionist viewpoints on other political matters, such as the
welfare state. Cultural and racialist discourses are mobilised to determine if
the different migrant groups are considered worthy of benefiting from welfare
and public services. Recent studies confirm the close relationship between
negative views of the impact of non-western immigration and attitudes towards
wealth redistribution and welfare access.

This means that although there is
still a generalised and positive attitude towards public spending for traditional
welfare sectors, there is an increasing consensus among the population in favour of ‘dualized ’ forms of access to welfare, such as the introduction of policies
that would restrict the access to welfare benefits and services for non-western
immigrants - now considered to represent a socioeconomic burden and a cultural
threat to Danish society. This negative approach to the economic consequences
of immigration seems to thrive during times of economic hardship.

12.	 Sentences. When imposing a sentence, the sentencing court is to con-
     sider the defendant’s (1) age, (2) mentality, (3) education and experi-
     ence, (4) social and cultural background, (5) past criminal record or
     record of law-abiding conduct, and (6) motivation for the offense, as
     well as (7) the nature of the offense and (8) the amount of violence
     involved in the commission of the crime.
13.	 ____. Generally, it is within a trial court’s discretion to direct that
     sentences imposed for separate crimes be served either concurrently
     or consecutively. This is so even when offenses carry a mandatory
     minimum sentence, unless the statute requires that consecutive sentences
     be imposed.
14.	 ____. A court’s failure to advise a defendant of the correct statu-
     tory minimum and maximum penalties does not automatically warrant
     reversal.
15.	 ____. A determinate sentence is imposed when the defendant is sen-
     tenced to a single term of years.
16.	 ____. When imposing an indeterminate sentence, a sentencing court
     ordinarily articulates either a minimum term and maximum term or a
     range of time for which a defendant is to be incarcerated.

                     I. NATURE OF CASE
   Kelly A. Vanness accepted a plea agreement and entered
pleas to four charges in the district court for Holt County,
for which she was convicted and sentenced to a combined
22 to 22 months’ imprisonment with periods of postrelease
supervision. Vanness claims that trial counsel was ineffective
in various respects. She also appeals her sentences, claiming
they are excessive and an abuse of discretion. The State notes
two possible points of plain error in connection with the sen-
tencing. The State notes that (1) the district court incorrectly
advised Vanness that conviction of a Class IV felony carries
a maximum of 5 years in prison, whereas the actual sentence
maximum was 2 years, and (2) the district court “may” have
imposed an indeterminate sentence, whereas the applicable
statutes for the convictions on three of the counts require deter-
minate sentences. We affirm Vanness’ convictions and modify
certain sentences, as we explain below.

424,13,24425,"If nothing else, this will remind everyone of the risks associated with government bailouts. In principle, they sound like a good idea in a time of crisis. In practice, however, the incentives to use them as slush funds for the well-connected are just too darned tasty to pass up. Case in point — Hunter Biden’s profit off of a bailout program his father was heavily promoting, as the Washington Examiner reported this morning.

The Cayman Islands tax dodge is just the icing on the swampy cake:

An investment firm linked to Hunter Biden received over $130 million in federal bailout loans while his father Joe Biden was vice president and routed profits through a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, according to federal banking and corporate records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. Financial experts said the offshore corporate structure could have been used to shield earnings from United States taxes. Rosemont Capital, an investment firm at the center of Hunter Biden’s much-scrutinized financial network, was one of the companies approved to participate in the 2009 federal loan program known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.

Hoo boy. This has everything a scandal needs except for the sex. Oh, wait …

TALF was the follow-on to the more well-known Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), a program launched by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. While TARP aimed to stabilize the overall banking and finance sectors in regard to mortgages, TARF ostensibly targeted the consumer-lending markets by indemnifying the purchase of collapsed bonds. Paulson started TARF in late November 2008 with a reserve of $200 billion in government-guaranteed loans to investors willing to put up some of their own cash to deal with the bad assets in consumer credit lending.

It only got to spend $43 billion, however, because Congress started getting suspicious of just how those loan decisions were made. Eight years ago, Matt Taibbi reported for Rolling Stone on $220 million that went to spouses of well-connected Wall Street investors, which was emblematic of suspicions about the crony-capitalism operation of TARF.

intellectual property laws? I find it hard to imagine it _not_ being just as
exhorbitant as Springer, Kluwer etc, in many cases.

I can solve your dilemma easily. Don't use the phrase ""Intellectual Property"".
Use ""copyright"" and ""trade secret"" to refer to those two separate concepts.

""Chinese theft of intellectual property"" is all about trade secrets, something
completely unrelated to copyright.

(There's also a distinction between violating copyright for yourself, and
violating copyright to sell copies of something, but I don't think you meant
bootlegging so we don't need to address that right now.)

~~~
scarcely
Can you explain the moral relevance of that distinction - the reason one kind
of theft of intellectual property is morally less bad than the other.

One idea is this: stealing trade secret is ""active theft"" whereas stealing
copyright is ""passive theft"". You do not need to leave your house in order to
steal someone's copyright. By contrast, to steal closely guarded trade secrets
you practically must conduct espionage. So this form of theft reminds us more
of real world robbery. We are apt to consider the victim physically violated
(by comparison, the idea that by downloading some pdfs from libgen while
sitting at home in bathrobes we've 'physically violated' Springer obviously
sounds very odd)

If that's the response then my reply is twofold. First, just because something
is more 'graphical' doesn't mean it's morally worse. For example, many
omnivores tend to consider people who eat dogs and cats to be especially evil.
On reflection, they realize that they have no principled basis for judging
themselves to be morally superior to the dog- and cat-eaters. The only reason
their initially reacted as they did was because they found the imagery of
eating dogs and cats much more graphical, since dogs and cats are such cute
animals. But cuteness is not (as most people would agree) a morally relevant
difference.

It's also worth pointing out that stealing trade secret is more graphical than
stealing copyright only because of contingent technological reasons. If we
lived before xerox machines, stealing books may require making efforts not
that different from physical robbery.

Second, I want to point out that you haven't really responded to the substance
of my point. My point was that perhaps the Chinese is unconcerned about their
'theft of intellectual property (trade secret)' for the same reason many
Americans are unconcerned about their 'theft of intellectual property
(copyright)': because ""it's not theft to steal something from those who aren't
entitled to it"". Simply pointing to the distinction between 'trade secret' and
'copyright' is not yet pointing to a distinction that makes an obvious
difference. If the point is simply ""stealing trade secret is obviously _much
worse_ than stealing copyright, because trade secrets are closely guarded, so
you need to basically pry them away from the victim"

The 1980 United States Grand Prix West (officially the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach) was a Formula One motor race held on March 30, 1980, at Long Beach, California. It was the fourth round of the 1980 Formula One season. The race was the fifth United States Grand Prix West and the sixth street race to be held at Long Beach. The race was held over 80 laps of the 3.251-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 260 kilometres.

The race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet driving a Brabham BT49. It was Piquet's debut World Championship victory in just his fourth points finish and announced his emergence as a championship contender. Piquet won by 49 seconds over Italian driver Riccardo Patrese driving an Arrows A3. It was the best result for both Arrows and Patrese in two years after Patrese finished second at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix. Third was Brazilian driver, twice-World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi driving a Fittipaldi F7. It was Fittipaldi's best result since finishing second at the 1978 Brazilian Grand Prix.

Sorry for all the comments, but I'm still trying to figure out using this :)
So does anyone know what I have to to in order to get inline cites, and not just numbers or footnote references.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Even in a numeric style it might sometimes be helpful to be able to refer to a source by (#, Author, year) not just [#].
The following defines a new cite command to deliver exactly this additional information.
This command is as of now neither capable of compressing (authors, numbers) nor ibidem functions.
You can add the following code to your preamble.
\DeclareCiteCommand{\morecite}[\mkbibparens]%
  {\usebibmacro{prenote}}%
  {\usebibmacro{citeindex}%
   \printtext[bibhyperref]{%
     \printfield{prefixnumber}%

     \printnames{labelname}}%
   \setunit{\addcomma\space}%
   \printfield{labelyear}}
  {\multicitedelim}%
  {\usebibmacro{postnote}}%

This will declare a new cite command called \morecite that displays the label number, author and year. There is no fancy year disambiguation etc. (if you want those authoryear or friends is for you), since the label number is the ultimate way to identify the sources.

Loss of *Fmr1* impairs ability to update existing learning with new platform location

The week following the initial learning trials, animals were tested in the reversal learning paradigm ( [Dataset 3](#DS2){ref-type=""other""}). During the 4 blocks of learning trials ( [Figure 2C](#f2){ref-type=""fig""}), a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures revealed a significant within-subjects effect of trial, *F*(3, 69) = 3.8, *p* \< 0.05. Trial results did not interact significantly with genotype, *F*(3, 69) = 1.28, *p* = 0.29. However, between-subjects analyses indicated a marginal effect of genotype, *F*(1, 23) = 3.93, *p* = 0.059 ( [Figure 2C](#f2){ref-type=""fig""}). Further independent samples t-testing revealed that KO animals displayed significantly higher latency to reach the hidden platform during the third trial, *t*(23) = -2.96, *p* \< 0.01. Together, these results demonstrate that *Fmr1* KO males demonstrate decreased learning and altogether a lack of cognitive flexibility across all trials of the MWM reversal task.

Impairments were not due to deficits in vision or motor capabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Visible platform information was also assessed to ensure differences were not due to deficits in vision ( [Dataset 4](#DS3){ref-type=""other""}). Results were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA across the four visible platform trials on latency to the platform across the two blocks of trials. Results indicated no effect of block, *F*(1, 24) = 1.341, *p* = 0.26, nor an interaction of block and genotype, *F*(1, 24) = 0.0005, *p* = 0.98. There was not a significant effect of genotype on latency to the platform during these trials either, *F*(1, 24) = 0.98, *p* = 0.33 ( [Figure 3A](#f3){ref-type=""fig""}). Altogether, these data suggest that differences in latency to the platform could not be attributed to deficits in visual perception in the *Fmr1* KO male mouse. Moreover, differences in latency to the platform on the previous trials could not be attributed to impairments in swimming abilities, as no differences in swim speed were detected during the visible trials, *t*(11.17) = 1.526, *p* = 0.16 ( [Figure 3B](#f3){ref-type=""fig""}).

430,14,15782,"LGBTQs & Women Hit Record Numbers In The 116th Congress

Earlier this month, the social media stratosphere flooded with images and sentiment of hope and change, a change created at the polls in the November 2018 midterm elections. This year was unlike any other, which led to a record number of women and LGBTQ members being sworn in to serve in the 116th Congress.

Though such a political upheaval was inevitable at some point, there could not have been a more appropriate time in our nation’s history as abusive, prejudiced, misogynistic, and anti-LGBTQ sentiments held the ideals of freedom hostage from within the walls of the White House. Undoubtedly, Trump has been the most publicly vile president in modern American politics, rooted in his discriminatory actions and remarks to numerous allegations of sexual abuse of women, to the attempt of stripping away civil rights from our LGBTQ community, etc., and the country isn’t having any more of it.

A New Era of Governing

The new Congress sworn in on Jan. 3 includes 125 women—18 more than the preceding Congress. The nearly 20 percent jump of women Congressional leaders are virtually all pro-choice, Democratic women who support policies to empower women and marginalized people. This is the most female representation we’ve seen to date. Likewise, 10 openly LGBTQ people were also sworn in earlier this month making the results of the November elections historical. The outcome, thus, makes a clear distinction in the values and beliefs of the modern day American people. The good ole boys club is “out” and diversity and inclusion are “in.”

“A historic number of LGBTQ people will serve in the new U.S. Congress and their influence will shape the debate on equality legislation and issues moving forward,” said Mayor Annise Parker, President & CEO of LGBTQ Victory Institute. “In the U.S. Senate, those opposed to the Equality Act will now need to look to openly LGBTQ Senators in the eyes and tell them their lives are not worth protecting. In the U.S. House, Speaker Pelosi will have eight LGBTQ Representatives to consult about how various healthcare or criminal justice reform policies uniquely affect our community. The relationships these LGBTQ lawmakers will build with their colleagues on Capitol Hill are transformative, and with an unprecedented number of women and people of color also joining the 116th Congress, equality issues will finally receive the attention they deserve.”

Half of the 10 LGBTQ members are women and two are people of color. This also gives rise to the importance of intersectionality and honoring individual and collective experiences to equal a greater whole, a more responsible one, rooted in authenticity of identities.

Given the iron fist stronghold of the current presidential administration, the elected representation says something—loudly. The weeks and months ahead will prove just how effectively women & other marginalized groups problem solve and strategize when compared to those who held in those very seats before them. And, thankfully so.

Critical issues like healthcare, education, and gun reform have largely been ignored by many in the Republican-led, white, cisgender male-dominated Congress in the past years. Instead, a focus has been placed on issues that are riddled in flexing military power with a refusal to compromise, which has lead to numerous government shutdowns, causing millions of Americans to suffer. Xenophobic initiatives like the border wall, stripping women of reproductive health rights, dishonoring LGBTQ service members, and stripping away LGBTQ rights grounded in caveman-like ideals have been on an ever-swinging pendulum.

Though a long time coming, unequivocally, this is the most diverse Congress ever to join the governing ranks. The 116th Congress has 125 women, more than 50 black members, 39 Hispanic members, two Muslim and two Native American women. Finally, it is starting to shape up to be the United States where we should all have a voice and a seat at the table—“we the people,” as it should have always been.

Women in Congress

Scrolling through my own social media feeds have left me with a great sense of pride. Seeing so many women uplifting each other with words and actions rippled an inexplicable sense of solidarity through me, catapulted by what I’m witnessing now. For the first time, it actually feels like “yes, we can” and, we did. Perhaps that sentiment is most explained through the concept of sisterhood. Though it has always been of great importance in my personal life, women, especially progressive women, have rarely been represented in powerful government positions. That chance to govern was often stripped from our potential. But, the tide has changed.

More women than ever before ran for office in 2018 and won. “We” won all across the county and we won in spades. Last year was dubbed the “year of"
431,1,23989," that neural variability will then infrequently generate activity that meets the threshold for reward. As soon as the sensory representation of this above-threshold brain-activity is followed by a rewarding feedback signal, the brain is able to memorize this distinct neural/behavioral state as a so-called internal set-point. This elicits a reward-modulated signal (such as dopamine) that supports synaptic plasticity. Subsequent feedback-loops aim at the reproduction of this set-point by using strategies in a feedforward way, thus comparing the actual state with the target state. Multiple loop-iterations (conditioning trials) will then lead to further refinement of the set-point, and to a more efficient strategy for its reproduction.

In addition, cognitive factors have also been shown to influence neurofeedback learning. Wood et al. ([@B140]) provided a framework based on the dual/two-process theory, which initially was introduced in the more general context of biofeedback (see also, LaCroix, [@B75]). This theory dissociates automatic from controlled processes, which have different characteristics. Whereas automated processes are regarded capacity-free, unconscious and difficult to control by self-instruction, controlled processes reflect capacity-limited activity of the supervisory attention system (Shallice and Cooper, [@B113]) and are mainly regulated by self-instruction. Furthermore, while automated processes are acquired based on reward-learning, controlled processes are mainly driven by direct self-instruction. On the basis of this theory, Wood et al. ([@B140]) suggest the existence of three networks that rely on either a single or a mixture of both types of mental activity. Central for neurofeedback learning, propose the so-called ""local control network"" that encompasses specific automatic processes ("

433,29,22900,"Many different types of printing have been invented, a large number of which are presently in use. The known forms of printers have a variety of methods for marking the print media with a relevant marking media. Commonly used forms of printing include offset printing, laser printing and copying devices, dot matrix type impact printers, thermal paper printers, film recorders, thermal wax printers, dye sublimation printers and ink jet printers both of the drop on demand and continuous flow type. Each type of printer has its own advantages and problems when considering cost, speed, quality, reliability, simplicity of construction and operation etc.
In recent years, the field of ink jet printing, wherein each individual pixel of ink is derived from one or more ink nozzles has become increasingly popular primarily due to its inexpensive and versatile nature.
Many different techniques of ink jet printing have been invented. For a survey of the field, reference is made to an article by J Moore, ""Non-Impact Printing: Introduction and Historical Perspective"", Output Hard Copy Devices, Editors R Dubeck and S Sherr, pages 207-220 (1988).
Ink Jet printers themselves come in many different types. The utilisation of a continuous stream ink in ink jet printing appears to date back to at least 1929 wherein U.S. Pat. No. 1,941,001 by Hansell discloses a simple form of continuous stream electrostatic ink jet printing.
U.S. Pat. No. 3,596,275 by Sweet also discloses a process of a continuous ink jet printing including the step wherein the ink jet stream is modulated by a high frequency electrostatic field so as to cause drop separation. This technique is still utilized by several manufacturers including Elmjet and Scitex (see also U.S. Pat. No. 3,373,437 by Sweet et al)
Piezo-electric ink jet printers are also one form of commonly utilized ink jet printing device. Piezo-electric systems are disclosed by Kyser et. al. in U.S. Pat.

Patrick Nyarko: For me, I’m not very vocal but I do it on the field. I come to training every day, put in the work I’m supposed to do and not complain about anything. I’m a guy that’s been through a lot of injuries but I almost never want to miss practice – the coaches might give me a day off and I’m freaking out because I want to train. I think that’s the example I try to set for the young guys. In games I try to execute the game plan to perfection and do everything the coaches require of me.

JC: What personal goals do you set for yourself at the beginning of a season?

PN: I go into the season maybe not with specific goals but trying to contribute in whatever way I can. Maybe its that my goal scoring needs to improve, getting more assists or defensively needing to improve. I go through all those scenarios for my position and what the coaching staff requires. To sum it up, I just want to be there to contribute to the team winning.

JC: As people began to see more from SuperDraft pick Yazid Atouba throughout preseason, some began calling him a “young Patrick Nyarko”. What does that mean to you and how do you think he’s come along with this team?

PN: It’s an honor to see someone, especially from Africa and very young being compared to me. It shows that I’ve been appreciated and I do the work I need to do. Yazid is a tremendous guy. He’s stepped in full of confidence and I think he’s going to be a huge part of this team this year.

Even though he’s young, he’s got the confidence of a top guy in this league. You don’t see that with a lot of rookies when they come in. He does what he does very well and I think with the group we have he’s going to keep improving every day.

He’s ready now to step into MLS games and be a huge contributor this year.

Randi Thompson's insight:

A horse that is moving freely at the walk will look like it is ""nodding"" it's neck. This starts at the poll and goes down to where the riders hands are. Now you can see what it looks like. In this session Susan focuses on Darrien's walks. First Darrien has to stay in front of Susan's leg aids. Than Susan will watch to see if he is nodding his neck, instead of bracing it. This is when Darrien is moving through his whole body and using his back.

""How do you ask your horse to back? Have you tried it from the walk and the trot?"" In this session you will see how we are using the backing to connect Susan...

Randi Thompson's insight:

In this session you will see how we are using the backing to connect Susan and Darrien (her new horse). To do this, she is focusing on keeping his shoulders and head up as he backs. Darrien is still rooting a little with the reins at times (he came to us with this issue) but is much better than he was a few months ago. In part #2 we continue with the canter (from the correct lead) to the halt, to backing up and back up into the correct lead canter.

What did you learn from watching Susan and Darrien that you can use while backing your horse?

The Affordable Healthcare Act stipulates that failure to carry health insurance can result in tax penalties, so if you are uninsured, you now have more motivation than ever to find coverage. Finding an affordable policy may seem like a daunting task, but today, those shopping on the private market have access to a greater number of options than ever before. With so much to choose from, how do you sort through plans, deductibles, and networks, and choose a policy that makes sense for you, your family or your employees?

An independent insurance agent who specializes in health insurance can be an excellent resource when you want to evaluate health plans. You may even discover that you can find a lower cost option through an independent agent than you can through your employer. This is because these agents can compare plans from multiple carriers to find the best fit and rates. Contact a Tri County agent and get all your questions answered right away.

How to Buy Health Insurance for Individuals and Families

If you are self-employed or you are not obtaining healthcare coverage through your employer, you need at least a basic health insurance plan to ensure that you are prepared for an unforeseen health condition or injury.

A full-coverage health insurance plan may be more suitable for your needs if you have dependents, you are getting ready to start a family, or you have a family history of certain health risks, such as heart disease. You should ensure that your healthcare plan helps you to pay for the broader set of services you need.

Use the handy checklist below to help you decide what kind of coverage may be right for you.

Healthcare Costs, Co-pays and Coinsurance

Your healthcare costs are an important factor to consider when you want to buy health insurance, and you have a number of options for managing those costs. You can choose to pay a higher deductible to lower your regular premiums, which means you need to pay that deductible amount for doctor’s visits and medical bills before your health insurance kicks in. Alternatively you can pay a higher premium in order to avoid a high out-of-pocket cost in the event of a serious illness. Bear in mind that health insurance companies are now required to cover preventive care visits (such as routine physicals, gynecological exams, and mammograms) in full so you will not pay for these visits even if you have not met your deductible.

Co-pays and coinsurance are two methods health insurance companies use to share the cost of healthcare. Co-pays are a small amount you pay for doctor’s visits, whereas coinsurance is an amount you pay in the event you need additional care. Your doctor cannot charge a you a co-pay for preventive care visits. Be sure that you fully understand any coinsurance payments your health insurance plan requires. In the event of a serious illness or injury, these costs can become very high.

A local independent agent in the Trusted Choice network can help you compare medical insurance quotes and find the right healthcare plan to match your current and anticipated needs.

Health Insurance Coverage Plans

Of the many associations discovered by genome-wide association studies, a large number are shared across multiple traits ([@btw075-B3]), and many more predict different subtypes of the same disease ([@btw075-B8]). A significant challenge for researchers is finding statistical techniques that leverage this genetic sharing to increase power and discover new biology.

Multinomial logistic regression provides a powerful and flexible framework to carry out association analyses across multiple traits. The frequentist version has been used in studies of disease subphenotypes ([@btw075-B2]) and in cross-disorder association studies ([@btw075-B7]). Bayesian extensions have been used to select between different models of genetic sharing across multiple traits ([@btw075-B5]).

However, these studies have fitted the models in an *ad-hoc* manner, using inefficient R or STATA packages. The lack of a single, flexible tool for multinomial logistic"

443,28,11269,"Theresa May struggled to contain Tory divisions over Brexit ahead of a crunch meeting due on Friday, at which she wants the cabinet to finally agree her plans for a future relationship with the EU.

The prime minister assured the commons that her cabinet is “strong”, but intense pressure came from the Brexiteer wing of the party, to dismiss any deal which leaves the UK too closely tied to the EU.

At the same time, a business minister warned a “no deal” Brexit would be “disastrous” and attacked those – including frontbenchers Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt – who have criticised companies for questioning Ms May’s approach.

The prime minister is meeting other European leaders this week, including Mark Rutte of the Netherlands and Germany’s Angela Merkel.

But the main event will be the Brexit showdown at Ms May’s Chequers country residence, where it is rumoured the cabinet will be asked to support close continued alignment on EU rules for goods and tariffs.

That prospect has enraged Brexiteers like ex cabinet minister Owen Paterson, who argued “the economic benefits of Brexit” will be lost unless the UK leaves the customs union “cleanly and completely”.

Mr Paterson said: “The Conservative manifesto at the last general election – which secured the most votes of any party since 1992 – was unambiguously clear: ‘As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or customs union’.

Sebastian Kurz emphasises importance of 'unity of the 27' during Brexit talks

“For the good of every citizen in the country, that promise must now be delivered.”

He claimed the new customs model due to be considered by cabinet ministers on Friday appeared to be “little more than a rebrand” of the “customs partnership” model, which would see the UK collect duties on behalf of the EU.

The Brexit that this government will be delivering, and is working to deliver, is a Brexit that ensures that we are out of the customs union, we are out of the single market, we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice Theresa May

Details leaked to The Spectator suggest the plans would see all finished, imported goods charged a UK tariff, set independently of EU rates.

That would mean Britain could strike trade deals with other countries that would cut the tariffs on their manufactured goods in exchange for allowing UK services into their markets.

But Britain would still promise not to deviate from EU standards, so we could not change regulations as part of any trade deal.

To minimise friction at ports and to help with the Irish border issue, goods would be tracked once they entered the UK. They would be charged the EU tariff rate if sent on to the continent.

444,2,23088,"As most everyone knows by now I had to make the tough decision to close Blank Slate Brewing Company earlier this week. My intent was to do it with little fuss or fanfare…just fade off into the sunset as they say. I didn’t want to leave a sappy farewell. I removed all social media to save myself the heartache of reading whatever comments would be written. I have purposely “gone dark” with respect to anything in the media, whether social or traditional. I am grieving at the loss of the business, the dream that I have worked tirelessly at creating for the better part of 10 years. There’s a lot to process emotionally and I didn’t want to add the stress of having to deal with it publicly.





It has come to my attention that in the absence of an official explanation there has been much speculation as to the reason for the brewery’s closure. It was never my intention to mislead anyone in that respect. With as many breweries as there are now I didn’t think anyone would really notice if our little operation just faded away. The reason for our closure is pretty simple. We ran out of money. There is no big conspiracy, no secret takeover, no legal troubles or personal issues. We simply don’t have enough cash to keep going.





If you know anything of the history of Blank Slate you know that it was built on a shoestring budget. Just me, myself, and I in the beginning. Every penny I have or will probably ever be worth went into starting and growing the business one day, one customer at a time. It might surprise some people to know that the entire operation ran with 3 or less people for its entire existence. It might also surprise some people to know that I have never personally made a dime from it. I never even drew a salary. I have relied on my loving wife for personal financial support for almost six years now. Keeping the operation afloat has been a struggle every single day of its existence but we made it work...until it didn't. There have been at least a half dozen times through the years that I thought we were going to have to go out of business but I always managed to cobble together enough money to pay the bills. I was determined that we would succeed doing things “the right way” by putting the product above all else and growing business honestly and organically, on our own, by our rules, and without outside influences. I never had much access to capital. I never ran in the circles that put me in the same room as a bunch of rich guys who I could get to “fund my dream”. I had to build it myself, physically and figuratively, and truth be told I wouldn’t have wanted to do it any other way.





Eventually as we grew I did ultimately find some people who believed in our product and philosophy enough to fund a needed expansion beginning in 2015 that would get us “over the hump” towards profitability. However, by the time everything was in place by late 2016 the brewing landscape had seemingly changed. A dozen more breweries had opened, all better funded than us with nicer taprooms and slicker marketing. Instead of our volume growing as expected it stagnated and in some areas actually decreased. We simply did not have the means to keep up with the ever increasing costs of trying to stand out in a crowd when compared to the next shiny new thing coming down the pike. Put all this together and an already tight situation becomes untenable. I tried raising more money but to no avail. The sho"

446,11,29999,"Korea summit back on, Trump says after meeting Kim envoy

Earlier, Trump told reporters that North Korean officials may come to Washington today with a letter from Kim.

He says: ""In light of how North Korea has behaved in the past, I believe that it is important not to reward North Korea exclusively for agreeing to have a dialogue"".

The summit, planned since April, was called off just a week ago by Trump amid a renewed round of heated rhetoric from Pyongyang and concerns over whether North Korea was honest about ""denuclearization"".

The historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting USA and North Korean leaders.

North Korea did make a grand gesture recently, inviting reporters to witness the detonation of underground nuclear test tunnels - but the USA intelligence community now says the performance might have been more theater than reality. Can you believe that we're talking about the ending of the Korean War?

USA defense and intelligence officials have repeatedly assessed the North to be on the threshold of having the capability to strike anywhere in the continental US with a nuclear-tipped missile - a capacity that Trump and other USA officials have said they would not tolerate.

Before he boarded Air Force One for a trip to Texas, where he will primarily focus on raising money for the Republican Party, the president told reporters the NY talks have gone ""very well"".

US officials have expressed optimism that the two sides are making progress toward resolving differences over the summit's agenda and logistical planning.

Mattis was speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an global security conference in Singapore.

South Korean media speculated that Mr Pompeo could make a third trip to Pyongyang and that Kim Yong Chol was carrying a personal letter from Kim Jong Un and might push to travel to Washington to meet with Mr Trump.

Mr Trump cancelled the 12 June summit last week, but both sides agreed to move forward. ""We welcome the summits that already took place between Pyongyang and Seoul as well as planned meetings between North Korean and USA leadership"". ""He's toning down his rhetoric, he's emphasizing positive things and he's just on a glide path to what he hopes will be a successful meeting"".

As a goodwill gesture, Trump said that he will not be putting any more sanctions on North Korea, but the existing ones will continue.

South Korean officials say Kim Yong Chol stormed out of the room during military talks in 2014 when the South demanded an apology for the 2010 attacks.

Until the end of 2017 President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un were hurling abuse at each other. He is the most senior North Korean to visit in 18 years, a symbolic sign of easing tensions after fears of war escalated amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year.

TRUMP: I think it's going to be a process that we deserve to have.

Trump says his June 12 meeting will be ""a beginning"".

""I don't even want to use the term ""maximum pressure"" anymore, because I don't want to use that term because we're getting along"", Trump said.

The envoy, Kim Yong Chol was previously chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a top North Korean military intelligence agency, and has spent almost 30 years as a senior member of the country's intelligence community.

Bolton and Pence have been sidelined and Pompeo, whom Trump has praised for negotiating with North Korea, has taken centre stage.

The 72-year-old is known for his hardline approach and has earned himself a formidable and dark reputation over his more than 30 years of service to the Kim regime.

Kim is expected to spend the night at the North's Embassy in Beijing before heading home on Monday. The president shook hands and posed for pictures outside the White House with members of the North Korean delegation.

The president on Thursday also briefly tweeted: ""Very good meetings with North Korea"". After backing out of the summit just eight days ago - sending his own letter to Kim citing ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" - Trump suggested that the cancellation was just part of a jockeying for position.

They continue to import the chassis' (tubular steel frame with hand crafted fiberglass body panels) from Brazil and assemble the finished product in Indiana. You can read more about the background and technology at the Special Edition website.

Kevin conducted our tour personally and we got to meet his son Carey as well. They were both very generous with their time and answered every question we could throw at them. Both guys are Class Acts which clearly shines through in their product and their facilities.

Doug will be adding his commentary to this thread, but I can tell you that it was like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for me. Rather that trying to explain it, I think that a few pictures would be more descriptive....

I just heard that last weekend from some car friends in the know. I also heard Chuck Beck is overseeing the operation and so far is not all that happy with the work so he is practically doing it himself.

He may end up taking it away from them and do it on his own. The man is 70+ so he can't keep it up too long. When I spoke with him personally a few months ago he said he was having a really hard time finding the right shop to do the work.

He is a bit of a perfectionist but since he is doing Porsche replicas that is a good thing

The 904 is one of my all time favorite cars. That is one replica I would consider.

452,25,6093,"Rigel, also known by its Bayer designationBeta Orionis (β Ori, β Orionis), is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and the seventh brightest star in the night sky, with visual magnitude 0.13. The star as seen from Earth is actually a triple star system, with the primary star (Rigel A) a blue-white supergiant of absolute magnitude −7.84 and around 120,000 times as luminous as the Sun. A blue-white supergiant, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and swollen out to 79 times the Sun's radius. An Alpha Cygni variable, it pulsates periodically. Visible in small telescopes and 500 times fainter than Rigel A, Rigel B is itself a spectroscopic binary system, consisting of two main sequence blue-white stars of spectral type B9V that are themselves estimated to be 2.5 and 1.9 times as massive as the Sun.

Contents

The apparent magnitude of Rigel is listed in the astronomical database SIMBAD at 0.13, making it on average the seventh brightest star in the celestial sphere excluding the Sun—just fainter than Capella.[11] It is an irregular pulsating variable with a visual range of magnitude 0.05"

At 10.30am on Thursday, Australian women asked the federal government to fund childcare for all essential workers for the duration of the pandemic. By 1pm, at a press conference fronted by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General Christian Porter and the Minister for Education Dan Tehan, the deal was done. In reality, there were hours, days and weeks of work by the union movement, headed by secretary Sally McManus, in cooperation with the government and other peak bodies and assisted by former ACTU secretary Greg Combet. But it felt good to have at least one crucial element of the response to COVID-19 sorted. It's going to be a long winter and we must be as organised as possible. Which is why Morrison's comments were surprising and also comforting. Morrison said Australia no longer had a red team or a blue team, no more unions or bosses. We are all Australians. That's all that matters. And then, like a bolt from the blue, he thanked McManus (I'm sure recognition of tireless Combet will follow shortly) and minutes later, his Attorney-General thanked the ACTU and I had a strong feeling I wasn't in the Kansas where unions were terrible registered organisations which should be dismantled instantly. Surely, the government's war on unions must now be over and if not, some clever young person will make a TikTok at least as funny as the one mocking Morrison for trying to handle the ABC veteran Andrew Probyn, to be unleashed in the run-up to the next election. You can imagine: ""I spoke to Sally McManus this morning. I want to thank her for her engagement... all Australians working together. That's all that matters."" That's all that matters. So what still needs to be done to protect and defend what the Prime Minister has described as our national interest? Gender Equity Victoria (GEN VIC) worked with women's organisations across Australia to build a list of 10 actions the government could take right now to ease the burden on women and other vulnerable groups. It consulted with the Gender and Disaster Pod's Deb Parkinson of Monash University and two women's health services WHIN and WHGNE; and developed a framework which will ease the burden on women in the wake of COVID-19. Parkinson says that the aftermath will be much like that experienced after the catastrophic bushfire season. ""All the same pressures are in place and we can see all the expectations on women to be both carers and workers,"" she says. Her research showed increased family violence in the wake of bushfires, often excused by the pressures of the moment. ""There must be no more excuses for violence against women, not because a partner has become unemployed, not because he has had too much to drink. We must work to prevent as well as respond."" Some might be easier to achieve than others but there's plenty of items on this list which just require money (and JobSeeker and JobKeeper are just the beginning). The harder ones are those which require respect. Let's go for the easy ones first. Fund gender and disaster workers. That should be simple. Boost all of the hotlines and refuge workers.

The average weight of the S and HS groups was 21.25 kg (SD ± 5.41 kg) and 13.92 ± 4.07 kg, respectively. A total of 10 catheters were placed in the right jugular vein, while two catheters were placed in the left jugular vein. Both catheters placed in the left jugular vein were accidentally placed in the left jugular due to a communication error during placement. All CVCs were placed during the first attempt without any complications associated with the technical procedure. Two dogs experienced single occasional ventricular premature contractions during catheter placement that resolved without intervention. There were no other complications noted during catheter placement. All catheters terminated at the cranial vena cava on the post placement radiographs.

All CVCs in both groups had catheters that flushed easily at every time point of evaluation. Two of the CVCs in the S group did not aspirate blood back, one at 12 h and the other at 36 h, both of which were positive for aspiration of blood at subsequent evaluations. One CVC in the HS group did not aspirate blood back at 18 h but was positive for aspiration at subsequent evaluations. There was no significant difference in the odds of aspirating blood between the HS and S treatment groups or over time (*p* = 0.70 and *p* = 0.97, respectively). In the HS group, the study was discontinued after 48 h in one dog and 54 h in another dog, due to inadvertent catheter removal by both dogs.

Subjective signs of mild phlebitis were observed in two dogs in the S group at 54 and 72 h, respectively, and one from the HS group at 48 h. There was no evidence of ongoing inflammation or patient discomfort, so those CVCs were maintained until the end of the study. However, there was no significant difference in the odds of phlebitis occurring between groups or over time (*p* = 0.65 and *p* = 0.68, respectively).

There was no evidence of hyperthermia recorded in any dog in either the S or HS group. No significant difference in mean temperature between groups was observed (*p* = 0.68) ([Table 1](#table-1){ref-type=""table""}). However, there was a difference in mean temperature over time in both groups (*p* \< 0.0001). The post hoc test revealed a significant increase in mean temperature of approximately 1.5° between initial observations at time 0 and 6 h into observation (*p* = 0.0009).

g++ and clang++ different behaviour deducing variadic template `auto` values

Another ""who's right between g++ and clang++?"" 
This time I'm convinced it's a g++ bug, but I ask for a confirm from standard gurus.
Given the following code
template <template <auto...> class Cnt,
          typename... Types,
          Types... Vals>
void foo (Cnt<Vals...>)
 { }

template <auto...>
struct bar
 { };

int main ()
 {
   foo(bar<0, 1>{});  // compile both
   foo(bar<0, 1L>{}); // only clang++ compile; error from g++
 }

Live demo
clang++ (8.0.0, by example) compile and link without problem where g++ (9.2.0, by example) gives the following error compiling the second foo() (but not the first) call 
prog.cc: In function 'int main()':
prog.cc:16:20: error: no matching function for call to 'foo(bar<0, 1>)'
   16 |    foo(bar<0, 1L>{}); // only clang++ compile; error from g++
      |                    ^
prog.cc:6:6: note: candidate: 'template<template<auto...<anonymous> > class Cnt, class... Types, Types...Vals> void foo(Cnt<Vals...>)'

prog.cc:16:20: note:   mismatched types 'int' and 'long int'
   16 |    foo(bar<0, 1L>{}); // only clang++ compile; error from g++
      |                    ^
prog.cc:16:20: note:   'bar<0, 1>' is not derived from 'Cnt<Vals...>'

If I understand correctly, g++ require that the Types... of the Vals... coincide where clang++ accept that the Vals... are of different Types....
Who's right? 
-- EDIT --
As pointed by Marek R (thanks) also MSVC (v19.22) fail to compile.
But, if I understand correctly, fail also compiling the first foo() call with the following error
<source>(13): error C2672: 'foo': no matching overloaded function found

<source>(13): note: With the following template arguments:
<source>(13): note: 'Cnt=bar'
<source>(13): note: 'Types={}'
<source>(13): note: 'Vals={0, 1}'

-- EDIT 2 --
camp0 observes (thanks) that g++ compile this code until version 7.4.
A bug introduced from 8.1 or is bugged my code and g++ has corrected his code from 8.1? 

A:

None of the three compilers is correct.
From [temp.param]/17:

If a template-parameter is a type-parameter with an ellipsis prior to its optional identifier or is a parameter-declaration that declares a pack ([dcl.fct]), then the template-parameter is a template parameter pack. A template parameter pack that is a parameter-declaration whose type contains one or more unexpanded packs is a pack expansion.... A template parameter pack that is a pack expansion shall not expand a template parameter pack declared in the same template-parameter-list. [ Example:
...
template <class... T, T... Values>              // error: Values expands template type parameter

Bikini Berlin is a concept mall, a collection of carefully selected and perfectly matched boutiques, concept and flagship stores as well as restaurants and service providers. The new shopping oasis addresses a sophisticated, trendy and style conscious international clientele with a high standard of quality and shopping experiences with this uniquely designed venue.

A new shopping experience

The basic idea of this architectural concept includes a combination of shopping, working, relaxation, cinema and hotel in an urban environment.

The centerpiece is the so-called historical “Bikinihaus” with a total length of 200 meters. The concept of the rehabilitation of the listed building complex dating back to 1957 comes from the renowned studio Arne Quinze. The Munich architecture studio Hild und K was entrusted with the project. Due to its two-tier architecture, reminiscent of the young and fresh swimwear garment at the time, the house was popularly called “Bikinihaus”.

After completion of the renovation, the visitors will find retail stores and restaurants on the bottom three floors of the Bikinihaus. The third to the fifth floor as well as the p"

Robots offer the hope that we can wave a magic technology wand and the drudgery of our lives will be relieved, and it’s one of the reasons robots are so fun. This is one of the few industries where we really offer a better way [of living], and although nothing is ever quick enough or fast enough or good enough, we do have some real successes to lend credibility to that offer.

[Talking about future home robots] is always a fun conversation, but I admit it can be frustrating. We can go and work for years and come out with a brilliant new design, and I’ll finish explaining everything we’ve done and how cool it is, and the first question I get is “That’s great, Colin. What’s next?” If you’d asked me when I founded iRobot, I would certainly not have guessed that our great success would be a vacuum cleaner, because it’s really just scratching the surface of what robots are meant to do.

How do you view the current state of automation within the home, where we don’t have robots scrubbing our bathroom tiles, but we do have assistants like Alexa and a great number of connected devices, like light bulbs and kitchen utensils?

The smart home is one of these great promises that hasn’t quite lived up [to expectations] in terms of experience, I think. We’ve seen a great proliferation of different elements, and the world is experimenting with how to fit them together, but we’ve learned that these elements by themselves aren’t necessarily enough to succeed. Very quickly, the amount of complexity you can manage in your home is overwhelmed by the number of connected devices, [so] we’re at this awkward stage where we have many of the parts but we don’t have a system that works.

That’s where robotics comes in. We should be designing smart homes like we design robots — with sensors, inputs, and outputs that can do physical things, like controlling lighting, heating, opening up blinds, and so on. For that, we also need spatial context. We need to know where rooms are, what’s in them, and tie all that together into an understanding of the whole home.

Where does iRobot fit into that vision then?

Well, we can do all these things if we understand where everything is, and we’ve got our vacuuming robots that can gather this type of information. You can imagine you buy a robot and it maps out your house and your connected devices. Then you start to get this alliance with your home"

468,15,25253,"La Romita

La Romita is a small neighborhood located in the Colonia Roma section of Mexico City. The area began as an independent pre Hispanic village called Aztacalco, later renamed Romita. When the area around the village was redeveloped into housing for the wealthy, the village resisted and remained separate socially although officially part of Colonia Roma. During the 20th century the area had a reputation for being dangerous as it residents were relatively poor. Today, the area is no longer poor or dangerous, but its streets are narrower than the rest of Colonia Roma and its residents still consider themselves distinct.

History

La Romita began as a pre Hispanic village that remained independent until the establishment of Colonia Roma and has remained semi-independent since. In the pre Hispanic period, the area was a small island called Aztacalco located near the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan surrounded by the shallow waters of Lake Texcoco. The name means ""in the house of herons.""  After the Spanish conquered Tenochtitlan, renaming it Mexico City, Aztacalco was one of the areas that the indigenous were permitted to continue living.

During the colonial period the village continued to be independent although its status as an island disappeared along with the waters of the lake. By the mid 18th century, a road connecting Mexico City and Chapultepec passed nearby and due to its many trees was named La Romita as it resembled an avenue in Rome, Italy. The village began to be called Romita as well with this name appearing in written records in 1752.

According to local lore, in the colonial period thieves caught in Tepito were hung here using the large Montezuma cypress trees that the area had, which became something of a spectacle. The now dry land became hacienda generally dedicated to the raising of horses.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Mexico City was growing westward over these formerly rural areas. In 1903, the hacienda land around Romita was bought with the purpose of creating a housing development for the wealthy called Colonia Roma. The hacienda immediately surrounding Roma became the streets of Puebla, Durango, Morelia and Avenida Cuauhtémoc. When Colonia Roma was created, Romita was officially incorporated into it, but the local residents fought redevelopment. The area has since developed semi-independently from the rest of Colonia Roma, both in infrastructure and socially.

The local residents were of a significantly lower social class than the rest of Roma, with the wealthy residents avoiding it for fear of thieves. In the 20th century, it was also the home of a notable pulque bar called La Hija de los Apaches located on Avenida Cuauhtemoc. In the 1930s and 1940s, the area had two legendary female thieves named Plácida Hernández and the other only referred to as ""La Loba"" (The She-Wolf). The area had one famous gang known as the Halcones (Falcons). This gang was prominent in the 1940s and 1950s, when it was led by Arturo ""El Negro"" Durazo and controlled a large part of La Romita.  Durazo befriended and protected a more studious resident of the area, José López Portillo, who eventually went into politics and became president of Mexico from 1976 to 1982.  In return for protection received when he was young, Portillo made Durazo the chief of police of Mexico City. This led wide scale corruption and brutality until Durazo was replaced and jailed by the following president Miguel de la Madrid.

The area's former reputation as dangerous was noted in a number of stories. The protagonist of the novel Las Batallas en el Desierto, written by José Emilio Pacheco,"

Toccata da me solo per poco tempo anni fa per lavoro, è una regione che merita sotto tutti i punti di vista. Partiamo il 2 di mattina presto e il viaggio fila via liscio senza traffico… Il “campo base” lo fissiamo al camping “Le due Barche” di Scanzano Jonico (MT), direttamente sul mare. Personale gentilissimo, pacato e cordiale come tutti i Lucani che ho avuto la fortuna di conoscere. Si montano le tende e si prepara un piatto di spaghetti. Poi in spiaggia a rilassarsi del viaggio. Lo Jonio è un gran bel mare quasi sempre calmo e pulito. La sera, su consiglio di una signora dello staff del campeggio, ci dirigiamo a Tursi (MT), paese poco distante ma che affascina al solo avvicinamento: siamo in piena Magna Grecia e il paesaggio ricorda la Cappadocia con i suoi calanchi meravigliosi. Si respira un’aria tranquilla, socievole e, su indicazione, andiamo a mangiare un boccone in un bistrot. E qui incontriamo il poliedrico Max! Il locale, il Bar della Croce, è piccolo ma accoglientissimo e il proprietario, Max, di una simpatia allucinante. Abbiamo degustato pietanze mai provate prima con sapori strepitosi in un’atmosfera goliardica. Ormai io sono Amedeo Nazzari e Nicola Giuseppe Garibaldi… Comunque, Max, non lo diremo a nessuno che si mangia bene da te. Ops l’ho fatto!! La mattina seguente i tre trekkisti (io, Giorgia e Nicola) ci spostiamo nel Parco Nazionale del Pollino per un’escursione tra faggi e pini loricati meravigliosi, ex laghi ora piani immensi adibiti a pascolo di cavalli e bovini, torrenti e sorgenti limpide e fresche… 16 km di meraviglie tra il Monte Pollino e il Monte Dolcedorme… a cavallo tra la Basilicata e la Calabria. E pensare che per sbagliare strada all’andata ci siamo imbattuti in una meraviglia della natura: il fiume Raganello con le sue sponde calanchive e, più a monte, le sue gole rinomate… Rimaniamo affascinati e ci fermiamo spesso per immortalare cotanta bellezza… Spettacolare anche la sorpresa alla fine del trekking: arriva un furgoncino e scende un signore con la moglie, probabilmente chiamati da un gruppo nutrito di trekkisti che sono ancora alle nostre spalle, e dispiegano un mare di ben di dio tra formaggi pecorini stagionati, salumi, capocolli, tutto di produzione propria… Spesa!!! Che spettacolo e che bontà! Il giorno successivo ci spostiamo tutti nel Parco Regionale delle Dolomiti Lucane, polo d’attrazione per chi ama la natura e l’avventura.

473,21,2916," rights of a debtor against an assignee.
Barclays nonetheless contends that set-off is allowable only where the defensive claim arises from the same contract or transaction as the plaintiff's claim. Even assuming that this proposition is true and that the cases cited by Barclays support *257 the proposition,[3] § 9-318 by its terms does not limit a debtor's defenses to claims arising from the same contract as is being sued upon by the assignee. On the contrary, § 9-318(1)(a) provides that a debtor may raise any defense arising from the contract, and § 9-318(1)(b) provides that the debtor may assert ""any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives notification of the assignment."" (Emphasis added). The Drafters' Comments to § 9-318(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code (on which Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 26 § 9-318(1) is identically modeled) confirm that a debtor is not limited to defenses arising from the contract between him and the assignor:
The account debtor may also have claims against the assignor which arise independently of that contract: an assignee is subject to all such claims which accrue before, and free of all those which accrue after, the account debtor is notified [of the assignment].
Barclays attempts to reconcile its position with § 9-318 by explaining that because Safran's claim could not have been asserted as a set-off against Interstate, it is not actually a ""defense or claim... against the assignor."" Barclays' reading of § 9-318 is too narrow, however. Even assuming that Safran, in a suit by Interstate to collect on the account receivable, could not properly have asserted its claim as a set-off, Safran certainly could have presented it as a counterclaim. ""Claim"", as used in § 9-318(1), encompasses counterclaims as well as set-offs. See Farmers Acceptance Corp. v. DeLozier, 178 Colo. 291, 496 P.2d 1016, 1018 (Col"

I came across a blog post and a paper describing methods for implementing an ARIMA model as a price forecaster. They both deal with the stock market, which is not exactly the same as FOREX. But given the lack of ARIMA examples involving FOREX, I've decided to take a look at these:

From the blog post it seems that ARIMA doesn't have a very good resolution in it's predictions. The most it seems to be able to predict is a likely dynamic range for the future return rate. The paper shows how an ANN predicts fluctuations more closely. Still: this paper uses a FFNN, whereas the russian paper from one of my earlier posts uses a SRN.

ARIMA seems more limited than the SRN in it's predictive power. Therefor, I have decided to give priority to the SRN approcah using the newelm function from neurolab which I mentioned in an earlier post.

The ARIMA implementation, nevertheless, has inspired me to attempt a new rustic buy-and-hold algorithm. One which takes into account the density of price falls through time, and a likely dynamic range for it. I will be reporting on the results later on.

In the previous post I showed that price fluctuations have a gaussian distribution. This has a similarity with gaussian noise. Apparently, there are several ways to predict gaussian time series. One is described here:

http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf

But it involves concepts which are too advanced and complicated for me at this moment. Besides: gaussian processes are not the same as gaussian noise. It seems that a gaussian process is formally defined as a process involving ""multivariate normal distribution"". Since the price fluctuations I'm studying have only one variable, I believe using gaussian process prediction methods would be overkill. I might be wrong, though.

Another method is one used to filter out gaussian noise. It's called ""Kalman filtering"". Kalman filtering seems useful, because it works by predicting gaussian noise in order to eliminate it. Because currency price fluctuations follow a gaussian distribution, I think the predictive component of"
479,25,21792,"CHICAGO—Gov. Pat Quinn said he won’t consider any legislation with special tax incentives to get Archer Daniels Midland Company to keep its global headquarters in Illinois until legislators approve a fix for the state’s nearly $100 billion pension crisis.

The Chicago Democrat said if a bill to provide tax breaks to any corporation arrives on his desk before a pension deal, he will veto it. He also said ADM’s efforts would be better focused on lobbying lawmakers to address the nation’s worst-funded public-employee retirement system when they meet in Springfield later this month.

“The best way to help jobs in Illinois is to do pension reform,” Quinn said. “To distract legislators in any way from this issue of a lifetime is just plain wrong.”

ADM announced last week it planned to move its headquarters—and 100 jobs—out of Decatur to a location with better global access and that would be more attractive to young industry talent. The agribusiness giant this week asked lawmakers to approve legislation that would provide up to $24 million in tax breaks over 20 years to keep the headquarters in Illinois. The company also plans to add 100 new technology jobs at the new site in the next few years.

ADM won’t say what locations it’s considering, but Chicago officials have said the city is in the running.

Speaking to reporters at an unrelated event Friday, Quinn said he didn’t think his position would put Illinois at a competitive disadvantage because ADM has said the most of its operations and some 4,400 jobs will remain in Decatur, which also would maintain the title of North American headquarters.

Victoria Podesta, chief communication officer for ADM, declined to comment directly on Quinn’s remarks, saying only that the company is still looking at “a variety” of locations. She wouldn’t say if any Illinois sites still were on the list.

“We intend to have those discussions directly with those officials,” Podesta said.

Quinn’s opposition to the incentive package is the latest effort by the governor, who’s seeking re-election in 2014, to increase pressure on the Legislature to get a pension deal. In July, he vetoed money for lawmakers’ salaries from the state budget, halting their pay. A Cook County Circuit judge ruled last week that his action was unconstitutional, and ordered the paychecks be issued. Quinn is appealing that ruling to the Illinois Supreme Court.

The governor also has said he won’t take a paycheck until lawmakers put a pension reform deal on his desk—a task they’ve been unable to accomplish in years of trying.

Illinois now has the nation’s worst-funded public employee pension system, with an unfunded liability that grows by $5 million per day. Members of a legislative committee tackling the issue have said they’re close to a deal, but also acknowledge it could unravel at any moment.

Quinn said Thursday that the pension issue is the No. 1 concern he hears from companies considering expanding in or relocating to Illinois. He said when the Legislature meets later this month for its fall veto session, “We need a vote.”

“Over and over again, business location decisions in our state are going to be determined by how we act now,” he said.

Quinn’s comments follow concerns about the ADM deal raised by other Democratic leaders after a bill containing the incentives was introduced last week. During a legislative hearing, Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, the second-ranking Democrat in the Illinois House, compared ADM’s request to blackmail and said it would eat away at Illinois’ tax base. Other lawmakers have said they’re concerned about giving incentives to a company to move jobs out of Decatur, which already has a high unemployment rate.

Quinn has criticized corporate tax “loopholes” in the past, saying in his most recent budget address that he wanted to end three tax breaks worth an estimated $454 million—legislation that went nowhere. But he also has supported some deals, including $100 million in incentives to prevent Sears and the corporation that runs the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade from leaving Illinois.

He told The Associated Press Thursday that the need for a pension fix has grown more urgent since that time. He also said other states had put incentives on the table to lure Sears and CME—and potentially thousands of jobs—away from Illinois.

ADM processes corn, soybeans and other crops to make everything from animal feed to ethanol. It has about 30,000 employees worldwide, about half of them overseas, and is No. 27 on the Fortune 500 list.

U.S. Men’s National Team vs. Costa Rica, FIFA World Cup qualifying, March 22, Denver

The U.S. Men’s National Team will face Costa Rica in a FIFA World Cup qualifying match Friday night at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park just outside Denver. The United States has not played a World Cup qualifying match since Feb. 6, when it lost to Honduras, 2-1.

Following the match against Costa Rica, the United States will play Tuesday at Mexico.

“We know we have a big task ahead of us and we are confident our group will get the job done,” coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. “Obviously there are many players out with injuries and that means the next person in line has a chance to step up. Getting points at home in World Cup qualifying is huge, and we are looking forward to having an awesome crowd supporting us in Denver on Friday night.”

Among the injured: Goalkeeper Tim Howard, who is out with a back problem.

UUO models and Ruxolitinib treatment
------------------------------------

Male C57BL/6 mice (Beijing Huafukang Biotechnology, China) that weighed 22-24g were randomly assigned to three groups with 5 mice in each group as follows: (1) Sham-operated mice with vehicle (Sham); (2) UUO mice with vehicle (UUO); (3) UUO mice treated with Ruxolitinib (UUO+RUX). To establish UUO model, mice were given general anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50mg/kg body weight). The left ureter was exposed via a left flank incision, ligated with 4-0 silk at two points, and cut between the 2 ligation points. The Sham-operated group had no ligation. For *in vivo* experiments, Ruxolitinib was dissolved in PEG300/dextrose 5% in a ratio of 1:3 (PEG/dex) and administered to mice by oral gavage at a dosage of 30 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days immediately after UUO or Sham-operation. The Sham and UUO group received PEG/dex alone as vehicle. The mice were sacrificed, and the left kidneys were collected at days 14 after surgery. All procedures were performed in accordance with guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China Medical University.

The demonstrated LOD with the current detection technique is better or comparable to the state-of-art technologies reported for electrochemical detection of miRNAs. Furthermore, the electrochemical sensor presents a simple and inexpensive detection strategy as compared to using complex fabrication steps or expensive enzymes (see [Table 1](#t1){ref-type=""table""}).

Voltammetric Biosensor
----------------------

With successful application of a simple amplification strategy to detect miR-145 using capacitance measurements, the setup was explored for additional applications. One such application explored the availability of AuNPs on the surface of the electrode[@b32]. Formisano *et al*. demonstrated the use of AuNPs on the electrode surface as a possible platform to immobilise thiolated ferrocene molecules[@b33]; such a modified AuNP with ferrocene was used as a redox indicator by monitoring the oxidation peaks of ferrocene.

Since detecting ultra-low levels of miRNAs can introduce false positives in the signal, a complementary voltammetry technique was developed in the present study by using thiolated ferrocene molecules (6-(ferrocenyl)hexanethiol), which will serve as a validation technique to confirm the binding event. After specific interaction of AuNPs with PNA/miR-145 duplex, 50 μM thiolated ferrocene was flowed through the system, allowing the thiolated ferrocene to covalently bind to the free available spaces of AuNPs. The PNA-based biosensor was tested with a wide range of miR-145 concentrations from 1 fM to 100 nM in 10 mM PB pH 7.4, where an increasing oxidation peak of ferrocene was observed ([Fig. 5](#f5){ref-type=""fig""}) after the final step of thiolated ferrocene flow using square wave voltammetry (SWV).

One of the most popular ideas is that Bigfoot is a descendant of Gigantopithecus, an extinct genus of giant ape from Southeast Asia known to us only through fossils. The Yeti, or Abominable Snowman, is also thought to be related to Gigantopithecus and, thus, to Bigfoot. In his book “Big Foot-Prints,” anthropologist and Bigfoot researcher Grover S. Krantz, who died in 2002, discusses the plausibility of the Bigfoot and Sasquatch legends and suggests a few vague possibilities for scientific names. Should Bigfoot be proven to belong to Gigantopithecus, then Gigantopithecus canadensis would suggest itself as an appropriate choice. Should Bigfoot ultimately require its own genus, then it should be called Gigantanthropus, presumably with the same specific epithet, canadensis. Krantz also considers a possible connection between Bigfoot and Australopithecus, an extinct genus of early humans found in Africa, which would lead to the name Australopithecus canadensis. Gordon Strasenburgh, another Bigfoot expert, had already published in 1971 on potential family ties between Bigfoot and another genus of hominids, resulting in an altogether different name: Paranthropus eldurrelli.

It’s not unprecedented for a possibly fictitious organism to fall under official protection. In 1969, Skamania County in Washington State put Bigfoot on the list of protected species.

But let’s return to the question of whether Nessiteras rhombopteryx is nomenclaturally available, which remains unanswered. Is it a valid name, according to the zoological nomenclature rules? Description, diagnosis, name, publication — check, check, check, check. The discussion is therefore focused instead on whether Nessiteras rhombopteryx names a hypothetical concept, in which case it wouldn’t fall under the purview of zoological nomenclature. Many people would surely assert that Nessie is a creature of myth and legend, lacking a biological manifestation in Loch Ness or anyplace else on Earth, which would therefore indicate a hypothetical concept. However, an important tenet of taxonomy is that, first and foremost, what is published is valid. Based on the publication, there’s no doubt that both Scott and Rines are thoroughly convinced that Nessie exists. In other words, the description of Nessiteras rhombopteryx was not published explicitly for a hypothetical concept, and it’s doubtful that the opinion held by many, if not most, scientists—that is, that Nessie is not real—could be reason enough to strike the name from the list of animal species in Great Britain. So there’s a lot to suggest that Nessiteras rhombopteryx can be accepted as a real, earnest, and, yes, valid name.

Interestingly, Scott and Rines compare their new species Nessiteras rhombopteryx with other mythical sea serpents, but specifically those that have also been formally named. The oldest is the Massachusetts Sea Serpent, named Megophias monstrosus in 1817 by naturalist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz. It wasn’t until 1958 that Bernard Heuvelmans — the founder of cryptozoology and one of its most colorful characters — described Megalotaria longicollis, another fabled species with the appearance of a plesiosaur said to live in North American waters. After comparing their photos to the other species’ descriptions, however, Scott and Rines conclude that the older names aren’t applicable to the “owner of the hind flipper in the photographs.”

Bernard Heuvelmans did more than just provide an American sea serpent with a name. Following the Second World War, Heuvelmans — who was born in Normandy in 1916 and was torn for many years between his two great passions, jazz and biology — began to systematically study enigmatic, mythical animal species. His two-volume “Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées”(On the Track of Unknown Animals) from 1955 was a bestseller and made him famous overnight. The book provided the cornerstone of modern cryptozoology.

Case in point, they go to save The Sovereign People from an inter-dimensional monster who's trying to devour their planet's power source. To ""pay"" the Guardians, The Sovereign People have captured Nebula and are willing to exchange her if Star-Lord and co. take care of the beast.

The Guardians want to take Nebula to the planet Xandar and turn her over to the Nova Corps. but of course, things go awry and that journey becomes very complicated according to James Gunn.

As for their defeat of the inter-dimensional monster, it seems Rocket didn't view Nebula as suitable payment and stole a few of the planet's power source/batteries which pisses of The Sovereign People and their leader Ayesha. In response, she hired The Ravagers to go after The Guardians and retrieve the batteries.

The Sovereign are genetically created beings who are sticklers for proper decorum and etiquette. Rocket's theft deeply offends them and it seems they'll go to any length to have their honor restored.

<h3>The SELECT Statement</h3>

<p>Use the SELECT statement to retrieve rows. The SELECT statement consists of:
<ul>
<li> the <I>SELECT-list</I> which identifies the columns (properties) of interest, </li>
<li> the <I>FROM clause</I> which specifies the scope (the set of files) for the search, and </li>
<li> the <I>WHERE clause</I> which is the search criteria.</li>
</ul>
If the results must be ordered, you can add an additional <I>ORDER BY</I> clause to return 
the rows in ascending or descending order.

<p><b>Example</b>
<p>
<code>SELECT DocAuthor, size, DocTitle <br>
FROM SCOPE(' ""/IISSamples/ISSamples"" ') WHERE CONTAINS(' ""index server"" ') > 0 ORDER BY size
</code>

<h4>The FROM Clause</h4>

<p>The FROM clause of the SELECT statement is used to specify the files on which to perform the 
search; that is, use the FROM clause to define the query scope. You can use the SCOPE() function, 
which is the main component of the FROM clause. 
The SCOPE function can take zero or more comma-separated Scope_Arguments (that is, <I>Traversal_Type</I> and 
<I>Path</I> combinations). You can specify SCOPE with an empty argument list, or (). This is the default 
scope that uses the virtual root ( / ) as its path. Each Scope_Argument must be surrounded by single 
quotes (see Examples below).
 
<p>In addition to using Scope(), you can also refer to any one of a set of predefined views of 
Indexing Service properties that are often queried against. You can reference one of these pre-defined 
views in the FROM clause by specifying the pre-defined View_Name.

<p><b>Examples</b>
<p>
<code>
SELECT DocAuthor, size FROM SCOPE() WHERE size > 500000

    To quantify the operational risk capital charge under the current regulatory framework for banking supervision, referred to as Basel II, many banks adopt the Loss Distribution Approach. There are many modeling issues that should be resolved to use the approach in practice. In this paper we review the quantitative methods suggested in literature for implementation of the approach. In particular, the use of the Bayesian inference method that allows to take expert judgement and parameter uncertainty into account, modeling dependence and inclusion of insurance are discussed.

Plot
Aditya Choudhury (Tapas Paul) is a faction leader in Kurnool who raised his sister Saraswati (Laboni Sarkar) with love and affection to make her forget the loss of their mother. During the marriage time, she eloped with Mohsin Khan (Rajatava Dutta), whom she loved which led the death Aditya Choudhury's father. Thus enraged Aditya cuts the leg of Mohsin which created a rift between the two families. On a case to win the property belonging to Saraswati, Mohsin wins the case on Aditya Choudhury after a long gap of 25 years. Seeing the sorrow of Saraswati, her son Sulaiman (Ankush Hazra) vows to unite the two families and waits for a situation.

Meanwhile, on a suggestion by Pulok Purohit (Kanchan Mullick), Aditya Choudhury appoints his manager Dayashankar Bal (Kharaj Mukherjee) to find a great scholar to perform a ""Shanti Yogga"". He contacts a scholar but as he was unavailable, he goes to the college where the scholar's son (who is also a scholar). The boy named Krishna, in a fit of rage (as his love interest Aparna is close to Michael because of Sulaiman), shows Sulaiman to Dayashankar and tells him that he is  Krishna Bhattacharya but prefers to be called as Sulaiman. Though initially he refuses to accept, Sulaiman accepts that he is Krishna Bhattacharya as this would be a Golden Chance to unite the two families. He, along with his friend Michael (Partho Sarathi Chakraborty) and a group of Bramhins (played by Lama, Aritra Dutta Banik, Bhola Tamang and others) goes to the palace of Aditya Choudhury.

There he manages to act well, only to be noticed by Puja (Nusrat Jahan), the adopted daughter of Aditya Choudhury. Though she tries to make his true colours screened (i.e. he is not a Scholar), he escapes by his wit and timing. In an unexpected situation, Dayashankar visits Krishna's home to pay his father but shockingly he finds out the truth that Sulaiman is acting as Krishna Bhattacharya. Having a fear of getting murdered by Aditya Choudhury, he discloses the facts and wants the ""yogga"" to be completed as soon  as possible. Sulaiman, though interested in Puja, finds his mother's wish much important and starts playing various plans to intimate feelings on Saraswati in Aditya's heart but all go vain. Meanwhile, Aditya's opponent Natawar Mondal (Supriyo Datta) attacks Puja but Sulaiman saves her. Puja falls for him and Aditya Choudhury feels that the attack was done by Mohsin Ali.

Now for Sulaiman, things go much worse as Jhimli (the Daughter of Dayashankar and the girl who is loved by Krishna Bhattacharya) returns to the palace, proposes to him, and warns him that if he refuse to love her, she would reveal the Secret. Meanwhile, Pulok Purohit, who is in deep frustration as Dayashankar made him not to"

During Estrogen Induced Premature Onset of Catagen, TGF β2 is Up-regulated and Induces Apoptosis of Hair Shaft Precursor Cells {#s2c}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The previous reports about estrogen induced hair cycle suppression were all based on long period estrogen administration model [@pone.0040124-Oh1], [@pone.0040124-Movrare1]. In order to explore the mechanism underlying the estrogen induced hair cycle arrest, we tried to confine the exact time point that estrogen starts to perform its suppressive effect. We orchidectomized wild type (WT) and estrogen receptor alpha null (ER α −/−) mice, and treated them with estrogen or vehicle oil and obtained time-lapse sections after 2, 3 and 4 days of administration (the time of orchidectomy and recovery was as same as the model in [Figure 1B](#pone-0040124-g001){ref-type=""fig""}). As our observation, after 4 days of estrogen administration, HFs of WT mice showed typical catagen V--VII morphology, while HFs of the vehicle oil treated WT mice and estrogen treated ER α (−/−) mice stayed at stages of anagen IV--VI ([Figure 4A](#pone-0040124-g004){ref-type=""fig""}).

![The premature catagen induced by estrogen was accompanied with advance apoptosis of precortex cells.\
(A) Premature catagen happened to the WT mice HFs as soon as the 4th day of estrogen treatment (P44). Yet estrogen treatment showed no effect on HFs of ER α (−/−) ones. (B) After 3 days or 4 days of estrogen treatment, precortex cells of the HFs showed Tunel-positive. The days of treatment are indicated. (C) Compared with HFs of the vehicle oil treated mice, the HFs upon estrogen showed cleaved caspase-3 expression in precortex region. Boxed areas are magnified in right-hand panels. Propidium iodide-labeled nuclei are in red. PC: precortex; ORS: outer root sheath; E2: 17β-estradiol; HF: hair follicle; ER: estrogen receptor. Scale bar: 50 µm.](pone.0040124.g004){#pone-0040124-g004}

In order to illustrate the cell behaviors in the estrogen-induced regressive HFs, we performed an apoptosis assay. After 3 and 4 days of estrogen administration, precortex cells showed a significant Tunel (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP fluorescein nick end-labeling) staining ([Figure 4B](#pone-0040124-g004){ref-type=""fig""}). Additionally, the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 was also detected in the precortex region of HFs upon 4 days of estrogen administration ([Figure 4C](#pone-0040124-g004){ref-type=""fig""}).

Molecular mechanisms of apoptosis control during catagen have been dissected and functions of several signalings have been demonstrated in this process [@pone.0040124-Soma1]. Among these signals, only TGF β2 expresses in DP [@pone.0040124-Rendl2]. Considering the location of ER α at DP, we supposed that T"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Industry has made more than 9.1 billion tons of plastic since 1950 and there’s enough left over to bury Manhattan under more than two miles of trash, according to a new cradle-to-grave global study.

Plastics don’t break down like other man-made materials, so three-quarters of the stuff ends up as waste in landfills, littered on land and floating in oceans, lakes and rivers, according to the research reported in Wednesday’s journal Science Advances.

“At the current rate"
498,0,5740,"Friday morning, SpaceX was prepping for what should have been an otherwise routine launch — sending 10 satellites into orbit for longtime customer Iridium — when the company made a strange announcement. During the live stream leading up to the mission, a SpaceX employee explained that the company would have to cut off footage from the Falcon 9 rocket once the vehicle reached orbit. And the host said restrictions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were to blame.

Viewers were immediately confused. SpaceX had cut off live streams early before, but only for national security reasons. Why was NOAA, an agency devoted to studying the Earth’s climate and oceans, getting involved in the launch of commercial communications satellites?

Why was NOAA, an agency devoted to studying the Earth’s climate and oceans, getting involved in the launch of commercial communications satellites?

NOAA had recently told the company to get a license for the cameras on the rocket, SpaceX said after the launch. The reason? The cameras take video of the Earth from orbit, and NOAA regulates imagery of Earth taken from space, thanks to a 26-year-old law. However, this was the first time SpaceX needed to get a license for its cameras. SpaceX filed a license application just four days before the launch, but NOAA couldn’t approve the use of the cameras in time. (Reviews can take up to 120 days, NOAA says.) So there was a blackout when the Falcon 9 reached orbit.

What changed? SpaceX and other rocket companies have been live-streaming their launches from orbit for years now, and practically all show Earth in the background. Well, it’s possible that SpaceX may be in NOAA’s crosshairs because of the company’s recent Falcon Heavy launch and famous Starman live stream. In February, SpaceX aired live footage of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s Tesla in space for hours, with Earth prominently featured in the background. It got massive amounts of attention, and that may have triggered NOAA to reach out to SpaceX, requiring the company to get a license for its cameras, according to a report from SpacePolicyOnline.com.

However, SpaceX says it didn’t need to get a NOAA license for its most recent launch for NASA, which sent supplies to the International Space Station on Monday. Government launches — like the ones SpaceX does for NASA — are exempt from some of the regulations of a commercial mission. But SpaceX does lots of commercial missions, as does its rival the United Launch Alliance and other launch providers. And it looks like all of those launches will need a NOAA license in order to live stream. “Now that launch companies are putting video cameras on stage 2 rockets that reach an on-orbit status, all such launches will be held to the requirements of the law and its conditions,” NOAA said in a statement on March 30th.

“all such launches will be held to the requirements of the law and its conditions.”

NOAA must issue licenses for any commercial spacecraft that does “remote sensing” of the Earth — or basically any vehicle that takes pictures or video of the ground from space, thanks to a law passed by the US government in 1992. At the time, private companies were interested in launching Earth-imaging satellites to make money, but the US was worried that they might inadvertently snap pictures of, say, troop movements overseas, and then sell that data to a foreign government. So a licensing system was put in place under NOAA to make sure these companies didn’t improperly share any sensitive government information.

Of course, back in 1992, satellite imaging technology wasn’t very advanced and there weren’t that many companies that wanted to do it. Fast-forward to today, and new space companies are popping up everywhere to image the Earth from space. One company called Planet has hundreds of small satellites in orbit mapping the entire Earth’s surface every day. Companies are becoming more ambitious, too. Some want to do space-to-space remote sensing or use"
