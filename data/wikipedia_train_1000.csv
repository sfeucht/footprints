Following unsuccessful efforts to secure registration of the organization as an Israeli NGO and secure it a publishing permit, it was outlawed in 1964. The political movement's goal was, according to political historian David McDowall, ""to achieve complete equality and social justice for all classes of people in Israel"" and ""to find a just solution for the Palestine problem as a whole, and as an indivisible unit."" Al-Ard's disappearance as a movement was linked both to governmental and popular resistance, with the Israeli Community Party denouncing the group and Palestinian Arab communities inside of Israel concerned that Al-Ard might destroy them.

""freedom""), officially Hofesh - Freedom from Religion () is an Israeli organization advocating separation of religion and state and stopping the religious coercion in Israel, objecting to repentance activity and going against it. The organization is an affiliate of Atheist Alliance International.

Goals 
The organization's goals are:

 To act and support all possible ways within the law for separation of religion and state and against any manifestation of ultra-Orthodox takeover and religious coercion in all its forms, including preaching Haredization.
 To act in any way to increase the awareness of the Jewish-secular identity of the liberated public in Israel, to cooperate with public bodies, organizations, cultural institutions and websites in order to expand the basis of the liberated, liberal, pluralistic and secular worldview of Israeli society.
 To serve as framework and address for all those affected by the acts of Haredization (repentance) and religious coercion, to guide and assist families affected by preaching orthodoxy.

History 

In Israel of the 1980s, there was an activity of ultra-Orthodox and religious associations, and the phenomenon of repentance among the secular public increased. At the end of 1985, a number of parents of a teen returning in repentance began to organize as a group and locate other people like them. In May 1986, the group established an association called ""Victims of Repentance"" (, Nifga'ey HaHazara BiTshuva), whose goals were:

 Publicly reveal the methods of the repentance advocators.
 Investigate the phenomenon of repentance and its scope.
 Stimulate public opinion in the country and expose it to the dangers lurking (in the opinion of the association) to the individual, family, society and the entire country from the process of repentance.
 Act with the state authorities, its institutions and leaders, draw their attention to the phenomenon, and prevent further repentance by stopping the flow of funds to the institutions engaged in this activity.

According to the association's website, the association succeeded in ""outlawing missionary work in schools and IDF bases"". In 1987, the association changed its name to ""ע.ל.ה"", an abbreviation in Hebrew for ""Association for the Prevention of the Haredi Takeover"" (), started dealing with issues other than repentance, such as the prevention of religious coercion and the prevention of the situation of the Halachic state in Israel.

In 1998, the association merged with Hofesh website, and changed its name to ""ע.ל.ה – חופש"". Since then, the association's activity has been conducted simultaneously on the web and outside of. Hofesh website was established in November 1997 and is operated by volunteers.

In September 2004, a decision was made to change the association name to ""Hofesh - Freedom from Religion"" ()

In July 2016, the association, along with a number of other petitioners, filed a petition with the Bagatz, demanding the Minister of Transportation, Israel Katz, and the Ministry of Transportation consider operating public transportation on Shabbat, in light of their refusal to operate public transportation on Shabbat.

The organization is an affiliate of Atheist Alliance International.

The organization is objectionable among the religious and Haredi public.

In 1915, Endert was appointed a Forest Officer in the Dutch East Indies Forest Service. From 1918 he worked closely with the Forest Research Institute at Buitenzorg (now Bogor), Java. In 1925, Endert accompanied a plant collecting expedition to central Borneo (Midden-Oost-Borneo-Expeditie), during which he collected Nepenthes fusca and Nepenthes mollis for the first time. In 1938 he was stationed at Makassar in southwestern Sulawesi, tasked with the supervision of the forests. In 1941 he was appointed Secretary of the Committee for Economic Plants. In May 1949, Endert returned to the Forest Research Institute at Buitenzorg to compile information on Indonesian timber varieties. He retired in 1952, and travelled to the Netherlands in July of the same year. Endert died in 1953 in Bussum, North Holland.

8,1289262,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.%20Susan%20Brown,L. Susan Brown,"L. Susan Brown (born 1959) is a Canadian anarcho-communist, writer and theoretician.

Brown is best known for her book The Politics of Individualism (1993) and for her article ""Does Work Really Work?"". In The Politics of Individualism, she makes a distinction between existential individualism and instrumental individualism and examines how these forms are utilized in liberalism (particularly liberal feminism) and anarchism. She argues for a new vision of human freedom which incorporates the insights of feminism and liberalism into a form of anarchism based on what she calls existential individualism. The work focuses specifically on the similarities and differences of these political philosophies by critically examining the liberal feminist writings of John Stuart Mill, Betty Friedan, Simone de Beauvoir and Janet Radcliffe Richards, especially focusing on the issues of employment, education, marriage and the family and governmental politics. In turn, these works are compared to the anarcha-feminism of Emma Goldman.

In both The Politics of Individualism and ""Does Work Really Work?"", Brown's conception of libertarian socialism is that all social bonds should be developed by individuals who have an equal amount of bargaining power because her view an accumulation of monetary wealth leads to the centralization of economic and political power in the hands of a small elite, reducing the bargaining power—and thus the liberty—of the other individuals in society. She provides an in-depth analysis of why the wage labor system is inherently corrupt and unreformable and why it must be abolished and replaced with a system in which people would be completely free to choose to perform (or not to perform) voluntary activities, a system that would encourage people to be creative and self-directed, that would celebrate enjoyment and fulfillment. Brown has published many articles on the political philosophy of anarchism and feminism and has had her work translated into Dutch, French, German and Finnish.

Brown works and lives in Toronto, Ontario and holds a PhD from the University of Toronto.

12,17097303,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy%20Irvin,Tommy Irvin,"Thomas Telford Irvin (July 14, 1929 – September 14, 2017) served as Georgia's Commissioner of Agriculture from 1969 until January 2011. Irvin holds a record as the longest-serving Commissioner of Agriculture in the United States, and the longest-serving statewide official in Georgia. He was also one of the last Democrats to win statewide in Georgia until 2020, when Joe Biden won the presidential election.

Political career
Irvin was born on July 14, 1929. A Hall County, Georgia native, Irvin was elected to his first public office as a member of the Habersham County Board of Education in 1956. A Democrat, Irvin was elected to four terms in the Georgia General Assembly as a Representative from Habersham County, where he served on the House Agriculture, Education, and Appropriations Committees and chaired the House Industrial Relations Committee and the Governor's Conference on Education. During this period he sponsored legislation to allow public funding of school lunch programs. He was the Governor's Floor Leader and later served as Executive Secretary to the Governor.

He was a delegate to the 2000, 2004, and 2008 Democratic National Conventions.

In 2000, Irvin made his first trip to Cuba, representing Georgia agriculture in support of free trade with the country.

He was elected to his 10th and final four-year term in November 2006. Rather than run for another term he retired, citing his age and Parkinson's disease as reasons for the decision.

In 1998, a portion of Georgia Highway 365 was named Tommy Irvin Parkway in his honor.

Controversy
Irvin's final term was not without controversy. Both Irvin and the Department of Agriculture were sued for permitting the inhumane killing of dogs and cats. In 1990, Georgia's ""Humane Euthanasia Act"" became one of the first laws in the nation to mandate intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital as the prescribed method for euthanizing cats and dogs in Georgia animal shelters. Prior to that time, gas chambers and other means were commonly employed. Irvin's department was tasked with licensing the shelters and enforcing the new law, through the Department's Animal Protection Division. However, Commissioner Irvin insisted the issue was a local one, and did not abide by the terms of the law. In March 2007, the Georgia Department of Agriculture and Commissioner Irvin were sued by former State Representative Chesley V. Morton, who had sponsored the law. The Fulton County Superior Court ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs, validating the terms of the Humane Euthanasia Act, and issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the Department from issuing licenses to shelters using gas chambers, with exceptions being made for those established before the act and those in counties with less than 25,000 residents. After the Court decision, and issuance of the permanent injunction, Irvin continued to voice resistance to the ruling. In an interview with a south Georgia newspaper, Irvin suggested possible ways to circumvent the law, including the use of private contractors to operate gas chambers.  When the Department continued to license a gas chamber in Cobb County, Georgia, in violation of the court order, a second action was brought, which resulted in the Department being held in contempt. The cases received widespread coverage in the media, casting Irvin in an unfavorable light.

Personal life
Irvin grew up the child of poor sharecroppers. When his father died, Irvin quit school to take care of his mother and sisters, running the business for several years until he got into local politics.

Irvin was inducted into the 4-H Hall of Fame in 2007, and he and his wife funded scholarships for youth.

He was a trustee at several schools, including Piedmont College and Truett-McConnell College. Irvin also served as school board chairman and president of the Georgia School Boards Association. He died at his home in Mount Airy, Georgia on September 14, 2017 at the age of 88.

13,51763404,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle%20500,Newcastle 500,"The Newcastle 500 (known for sponsorship reasons as the Repco Newcastle 500) is an annual motor racing event for Supercars, held at the Newcastle Street Circuit in Newcastle, New South Wales since 2017. The event was cancelled in 2020 Supercars Championship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is not due to return to the calendar until the first round of the 2022 season.

Format
The event is staged over a three-day weekend, from Friday to Sunday. Two forty-minute practice sessions are held on Friday. Saturday features a twenty-minute qualifying session which decides the grid positions for the following 250 kilometre race. A twenty-minute qualifying session is held on Sunday, succeeded by a top ten shootout, the combined results of which decide the grid for the following 250 km race.

History
From 2009 until 2016, the final event on the Supercars calendar was the Sydney 500 at the Sydney Olympic Park Street Circuit. Following the demise of the event, Supercars opened discussions with Destination NSW for a replacement event in the state. Initial plans for a race at Gosford on the state's Central Coast fell through after several months of negotiations, leaving Newcastle as the leading alternative.  In September 2016, Newcastle's place as the final event of the 2017 season was confirmed in an announcement made by Supercars CEO James Warburton and Premier Mike Baird. In December 2016, the track layout and a November 2017 date for the inaugural event were confirmed.

The first two events in 2017 and 2018 both saw close championship deciders involving Scott McLaughlin. The inaugural event culminated in the 2017 championship being decided in the final minutes of the Sunday race with McLaughlin requiring no worse than an 11th-place finish to win the championship over Jamie Whincup after winning the Saturday race with Whincup 21st. McLaughlin was running in 11th on the penultimate lap of the final race before an incident with Craig Lowndes exiting the first corner. Following an immediate stewards review, McLaughlin was given a time penalty for the contact with Lowndes, which awarded a record seventh championship to Whincup.

McLaughlin again entered the 2018 event in championship contention, this time against Whincup's team-mate Shane van Gisbergen. In the Saturday race, van Gisbergen overtook McLaughlin on the final lap as McLaughlin ran low on fuel. Van Gisbergen was then given a post-race penalty for a pitlane infringement which pushed him to fifth in the final results. McLaughlin then finished second in the Sunday race to secure his first championship title, only conceding the race lead in the late stages to David Reynolds, who scored the most points at the event for the second consecutive year. The result meant that the Ford Falcon won the championship in its final scheduled championship entry and the event was also the final drive of Craig Lowndes' full-time career.

The planned 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was again excluded from the 2021 calendar. It was confirmed in December 2020 that the event would be the opening round of the 2022 Supercars Championship in early 2022.

Criticism
Before the first running of the event, many East End residents raised concerns about the implications of the event's running in this area of the city. Up to 140 residents staged a protest resulting in clashes against Supercars fans, among concerns about noise restrictions and lack of access during the race weekend.

22,4074706,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifie,Fifie,"The Fifie is a design of sailing boat developed on the east coast of Scotland. It was a traditional fishing boat used by Scottish fishermen from the 1850s until well into the 20th century. These boats were mainly used to fish for herring using drift nets, and along with other designs of boat were known as herring drifters.

Design
While the boats varied in design, they can be categorised by their vertical stem and stern, their long straight keel and wide beam. These attributes made the Fifies very stable in the water and allowed them to carry a very large set of sails. The long keel, however, made them difficult to manoeuvre in small harbours.

Sailing Fifies had two masts with the standard rig consisting of a main dipping lug sail and a mizzen standing lug sail. The masts were positioned far forward and aft on the boat to give the maximum clear working space amidships. A large fifie could reach just over  in length. Because of their large sail area they were very fast sailing boats.

Fifies built after 1860 were all decked and from the 1870s onwards the bigger boats were built with carvel planking, i.e. the planks were laid edge to edge instead of the overlapping clinker style of previous boats. The introduction of steam powered capstans in the 1890s, to help raising the lugs sails, allowed the size of these vessels to increase from  to over  in length. From about 1905 onwards sailing Fifies were gradually fitted with engines and converted to motorised vessels.

There are few surviving examples of this type of fishing boat still in existence. The Scottish Fisheries Museum based in Anstruther, Fife has restored and still sails a classic example of this type of vessel named the Reaper. The Swan Trust in Lerwick, Shetland have restored and maintain another Fifie, The Swan, as a sail training vessel. She now takes over 1000 trainees each year, and has taken trainees to participate in the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Races to ports in France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland as well as around the UK. The Isabella Fortuna is owned by the Wick Society.

23,183190,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing%20E-6%20Mercury,Boeing E-6 Mercury,"The Boeing E-6 Mercury (formerly Hermes) is an airborne command post and communications relay based on the Boeing 707. The original E-6A manufactured by Boeing's defense division entered service with the United States Navy in July 1989, replacing the EC-130Q. This platform, now modified to the E-6B standard, conveys instructions from the National Command Authority to fleet ballistic missile submarines (see communication with submarines), a mission known as TACAMO (""Take Charge And Move Out""). The E-6B model deployed in October 1998 also has the ability to remotely control Minuteman ICBMs using the Airborne Launch Control System. The E-6B replaced Air Force EC-135Cs in the ""Looking Glass"" role, providing command and control of U.S. nuclear forces should ground-based control become inoperable. With production lasting until 1991, the E-6 was the final new derivative of the Boeing 707 to be built.

Design and development

Like the E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, the E-6 is adapted from Boeing's 707-320 airliner. Rolled out at Boeing's Renton Factory on 18 December 1986, the first E-6 made its maiden flight on 19 February 1987, when it was flown to nearby Boeing Field in south Seattle for fitting of mission avionics; it was delivered to the Navy for testing on 22 July 1988.

The E-6A, which was initially named Hermes, entered service with VQ-3 on 3 August 1989, with the second squadron, VQ-4 receiving its first E-6As in January 1991, allowing the EC-130Q to be phased out in June that year. The E-6A was renamed Mercury in autumn 1991 by request of the Navy; sixteen were delivered from 1988 to 1992.

The E-6B is an upgrade of the E-6A. It includes a battlestaff area and updated mission equipment.  The flight deck systems were later replaced with an off-the-shelf 737 Next Generation cockpit. This greatly increases the situational awareness of the pilot and saves significant cost over the previous custom avionics package. The first E-6B was accepted in December 1997. All 16 E-6A aircraft were modified to the E-6B standard, with the final delivery taking place on 1 December 2006.

The E-6 cannot use the probe-and-drogue in-flight refueling method that most other US Navy aircraft use, instead featuring a flying boom receptacle on the upper-forward fuselage, making it, like the USN's Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, reliant on U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender and KC-46 Pegasus aircraft for in-flight refueling.

Operational history
Codenamed Looking Glass, it is United States Strategic Command's (USSTRATCOM) Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), designed to take over in case the Global Operations Center (GOC), located at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, is destroyed or incapable of communicating with strategic forces. The term ""Looking Glass"" is used because the ABNCP ""mirrors"" the abilities of the US Strategic Command GOC to control nuclear forces.

The E-6 fleet is based at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, and operated by Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 3 (VQ-3), VQ-4, and VQ-7.

In 2021, one of the E-3D Sentry aircraft that had been in service with the Royal Air Force was purchased for conversion into a dedicated E-6 trainer. This was done as a means of extending the life of the operational fleet by reducing the need for it to be used for training missions.

It is located along the Manali-Leh Highway, about  north-east of intersection of the Chandra, Bhaga, and Chenab valleys, on the banks of Bhaga River.

Sights and festivals
Kyelang faces the famous Kardang Monastery, the largest and most important monastery in Lahaul, of the Drukpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism, which is on a slope across the river from Keylong.

Sights near Kyelang include the Kardang, Shasur, and Tayul monasteries, all within a few kilometres of Kyelang. There is also a small temple dedicated to the local deity Kelang Wazir in the house of Shri Nawang Dorje that may be visited upon arrangement.

The annual Lahaul Festival is held here each July with a big, busy market and a number of cultural activities.

Tourism
Kyelang is the district headquarters of Lahaul and Spiti district and is home to most of the government offices and facilities in Lahaul. It hosts a regular bazaar.

There are some tourist facilities including a Circuit House, a Public Works Department (PWD) Rest House, a Sainik (Army) Rest House, a Tourist Bungalow, and a number of small hotels.

Access
Kyelang is accessed from Manali by Manali-Leh Highway, a part of NH21. It is located about  north of Manali. It is located at an altitude of  and remained  cut off  from October-end to mid-May due to heavy snowfall at Rohtang pass until 2019-20 calendar. However, after opening of Atal Tunnel in October 2020, Keylang is now accessible for almost whole year from the outside world. The peak travel season is during May, June and October when a lot of tourists visit Rohtang pass and Atal tunnel. There are enough buses in summer season from Kulu and Manali.

Manali to Atal tunnel south portal is 25 km via Solang valley road. The length of Atal tunnel up to North portal is 9 km. From North portal one has to cross bridge on Chandra river and then turn left to go to Sissu  away, then continue to Tandi  away, and then turn right to reach Keylong.

Atal tunnel

Due to the military significance of Leh-Manali highway and the need to keep it open for the entire year, the Indian government began building the $320 million  long horseshoe shaped Atal Tunnel project in 2010 to bypass Rohtang pass to create a much safer and faster year-round link to Kyelang.  The tunnel is now open for traffic and it has shorten the distance between Manali and Keylang by , and the travel time from  Manali to Keylang is about 2 hrs now. While it used to take 4 to 6 hours to ascend, negotiate and descend the Rohtang pass, it will take only about 15 minutes to travel through the Atal tunnel.

Another way to access the area is by coming by air to Kullu and then travelling on the Leh-Manali highway to Kyelang.

The Forest Reserve lies adjacent to the Belize-Guatemalan border and as such had been the focus of illegal harvesting of Xate by Guatemalan Xateros. The Chiquibul forest reserve consists of 59,822 hectares. The Chiquibul Forest Reserve is bordered to the southwest, east, and south by the Chiquibul National Park, on the northwest edge by the Caracol Archaeological Reserve (CAR), and on the north side by the Mountain Pine Ridge. The Chiquibul Forest Reserve along with the Chiquibul Park and the Caracol Archeological Reserve compose the Chiquibul Forest.

History
The Chiquibul Forest Reserve which lies wholly within the Greater Mayan Mountains of Belize was first designated as a forest reserve in 1956 when it covered an area of 184,925.9 hectares. Part of the reserve was then re-classified as the Chiquibul National Park and the Caracol Archeological Reserve. Since the reclassification in 1991, the Chiquibul Forest Reserve has covered 59,822 hectares. The Chiquibul Forest reserve is the largest managed reserve in Belize.

Management
The reserve is managed for timber products and non-timber forest products. The Chiquibul forest reserve is managed by Bulridge Limited under a long-term forest license issued by the Government of Belize in 2006 with the Belize Forest Department as the regulatory body for sustainable forest management in the reserve. Bulridge Limited, under its long-term forest license, conducts selective logging, as well as silvicultural practices and road maintenance to promote sustainable logging operations within the Chiquibul Forest Reserve.

Threats
The primary threat to the flora and fauna that the Chiquibul Forest Reserve faces is poaching, illegal logging, harvesting of Xate, and other illegal activities.  These activities are performed primarily by residents of a number of Guatemalan communities that lie close to the Belize-Guatemalan border, and have easy access to the reserve. Access to the reserve from the Belizean side is more problematic.

Flora and fauna
The Chiquibul Forest region, including the Chiquibul Forest Reserve includes seventeen distinct ecosystems which are largely variants of lowland and submontane tropical evergreen broadleaf forests with differing levels of humidity and substrate types. This provides a diversity which habitat for a wide variety of fauna, including many rare species such as jaguar, ocelot, margay, and scarlet macaw. It is estimated the area receives 2,000 mm of rainfall per year and forms part of the Belize River watershed, and riparian areas that support the Baird’s tapir.

30,9768093,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch%20pitcher,Switch pitcher,"In baseball, a switch-pitcher is an ambidextrous pitcher who is able to pitch with both the right and left hand from the pitcher's mound.

Four 19th-century pitchers are known to have thrown with both hands: Tony Mullane in 1882 and in 1893, Elton Chamberlain in 1888, Larry Corcoran in 1884, and George Wheeler.

Negro league switch-pitcher Larry Kimbrough was a natural left-hander, but learned to throw right-handed as a child while recuperating from an injury.

Greg A. Harris was one of few major league pitchers in the modern era to pitch with both his left and his right arm, though he only did so in a single Major League game. A natural right-hander, by 1986 he could throw well enough left-handed that he felt capable of pitching with either arm in a game. Harris did not throw left-handed in a regular-season game until September 28, 1995, the penultimate game of his career. Pitching for the Montreal Expos against the Cincinnati Reds in the ninth inning, Harris retired Reggie Sanders pitching right-handed, then switched to his left hand for the next two hitters, Hal Morris and Eddie Taubensee, who were both left-handed batters. Harris walked Morris but got Taubensee to ground out. He then went back to his right hand to retire Bret Boone to end the inning.

Pat Venditte regularly pitches with both arms.  Venditte was drafted by the New York Yankees, played  for the Seattle Mariners, Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and now plays for the Miami Marlins. While with the Staten Island Yankees, the Yankees' Single-A affiliate, when he opposed switch hitter Ralph Henriquez, Venditte switched his modified glove to his left arm. (Hitters traditionally derive advantages from batting from the opposite side of the plate to the pitcher's throwing arm.) Henriquez then switched to batting left-handed, and a series of changes continued for several minutes. This prompted the PBUC (Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation) to issue a new rule about switch-pitching. In short, switch-pitchers must indicate to the umpire, batter, and any runners the hand which they will use to pitch. The pitcher must continue using this hand for the duration of the at bat, with some exceptions for injury and the use of pinch hitters. Following this choice, batters can then select with which hand they will bat.

Right-handed pitcher Yu Darvish throws with his left hand when training. He does this to keep both arms strong and balanced. He does not pitch left-handed during a game, however.

In 2003, the Atlanta Braves drafted switch pitcher Brandon Berdoll of Temple (Texas) Junior College in the 27th round. He never made it to the major leagues.

In the collegiate ranks, Matt Brunnig (Harvard class of 2006–07) was able to pitch over 85 mph left-handed and over 90 mph right-handed, but only pitched with both arms in the same game a few times. In college, he pitched more from the right side as a starter and pitched some relief as a lefty although he did start one game left-handed.  When playing the outfield after a start he would typically play the position with the other arm to rest the arm he just pitched with.

Switch-throwers are commonly taught to switch-throw at a young age. For instance, Venditte's father trained him in ambidextrous throwing from the age of three and Brunnig's father taught him from age five.

Johannes Kepler called the Canon Sinuum the most precise known table of sines.

The Canon Sinuum was computed by Bürgi's algorithms explained in his work Fundamentum Astronomiae presented to Emperor Rudolf II. in 1592. These algorithms made use of differences and were one of the early uses of difference calculus. The largest trigonometrical table actually contained in the Fundamentum Astronomiae is a table giving the sines for every minute of the quadrant and to 5 to 7 sexagesimal places.

The manuscript of Fundamentum Astronomiae is now in the collection of the Biblioteka Uniwersytecka in Wrocław, Poland.

35,28058485,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-four%20priestly%20gifts,Twenty-four priestly gifts,"The twenty-four kohanic gifts are a description in the Gemara tradition of offerings given to the Jewish priests. The adjective ""kohanic"" means ""of a kohen"", relating to a Jewish priest.

The Kohanim were compensated for their service in the Temple in Jerusalem – and to the nation – through twenty-four ""priestly gifts.""  The majority of these gifts were food items. Of these twenty-four gifts, ten gifts were given to the priests in the Temple, four were to be consumed by the priests in Jerusalem, and ten were to be given to the priests outside the land of Israel. 

The gifts are not given today, because there is no Holy Temple in Jerusalem. For example, most practicing Jews today do not give first-born of their animals to modern Kohanim. Other practices may be followed, such as selling the mother animal to a non-Jew before it gives birth to the firstborn, and then buying both the mother and the first born back.

Gifts
According to Tosefta, ten 'gifts' which were to be given to the Kohanim within the Temple area were portions of:
1. an animal brought as a sin offering
2. guilt offering
3. sacrifices of the communal peace offering
4. a bird brought in as a sin offering
5. the suspensive guilt offering
6. the olive oil offering of a metzora
7. the two loaves of bread brought on Shavuot (first fruits)
8. the showbread
9. the left over portion of the meal offering
10. the left over portion of grain from the offering of the first sheaf, the omer offering

Four further gifts to be given (or to be consumed) within the confines of the walls of Jerusalem, were:
11. firstborn of any domestic kosher animal
12. first fruits
13. the inner organs of certain offerings, that which is removed from the Nazirite offering
14. the skins of certain offerings

Ten gifts which may be given (or consumed) outside of Jerusalem, were:
15. heave offering of a portion of the harvest
16. heave offering of the tithe - a tithe of the Levite's tithe
17. Challah - Dough offering
18. the first shearing of the sheep
19. foreleg, cheeks and maw of all non-sanctified, ritually slaughtered domestic animals
20. money given in exchange for redemption of a first-born son (Hebrew: pidyon haben פדיון הבן; redemption of the son) - in rabbinical practice five silver shekels for the redemption of a firstborn Israelite son
21. money (or a sheep or goat) redeemed in place of a firstborn donkey
22. things declared herem, the hromim property or possession dedicated to the Temple without specifying to which use it is to be given
23. inherited fields that were dedicated to the Temple and not reclaimed in the Jubilee year
24. that recovered which was stolen from a resident alien who has died, leaving no heirs

Females, who did not serve in the Tabernacle or the Temple, were permitted to consume and/or benefit from some of the twenty-four priestly gifts. But if a Kohen's daughter married a man from outside the Kohanic line, she was no longer permitted to benefit from the priestly gifts. Conversely, the daughter of a non-priest who married a priest took on the same rights as an unmarried daughter of a priest.

44,42276835,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunekune%20%28urban%20legend%29,Kunekune (urban legend),"The  is a fictitious being that originated on the Internet as a Japanese urban legend. First mentioned on websites in 2001, the Kunekune is typically described as having a slender, white, paper - or fabric-like humanoid shape, and is usually said to appear in fields on hot summer days. Its name, Kunekune, is derived from its alleged behavior of wiggling its limbs. Explanations for the Kunekune include its appearances being the result of confusion with scarecrows or wick drains.

Description 
The Kunekune is said to resemble a slender, white humanoid shape, like a paper mannequin or a piece of fine fabric. It is said that the being can be found at lunchtime during hot summer days. The Kunekune lingers in widely extended rice fields or acres, in rare cases it might be found over the open sea. Its limbs are said to wiggle permanently, as if there was a straight gust of wind, even if it was a windless day. This behaviour gave the being the Japanese name ""Kunekune"", meaning ""to twist"", ""to wiggle"" or ""to meander"".

The Kunekune allegedly can only become visible from a distance; witnesses may see field workers or others closer to a Kunekune who do not seem to be aware of it. In some variations, if an individual tries to look at it up close, they will go insane. In other versions, if someone touches it, or simply comes too close, the Kunekune will kill them. Even looking at it from a distance for too long is said to be unwise. If someone does not approach or make contact with the Kunekune, it is said that the Kunekune will ignore them.

Background 
Kunekune first appeared in a short horror story posted on 2channel in 2001. The story was well-received on 2channel, inspiring other users to share their own similar (mostly made up) stories. Kunekune stories are all written in the first person singular in an attempt to make them look like eyewitness reports. A similar phenomenon can be observed with the case of the Slender Man and with Hanako-san.

The appearance of the Kunekune may be the result of confusion with traditional scarecrows, which are found in fields of rice and barley, or , or snake worship like  or misinterpretation of a wick drains planted to drain water from inner ground to robust the soft ground. Another possible explanation might be thick fog clouds, which appear over the fields during lunchtime. A third possibility might be hallucinations, created by heat stroke and dehydration during hot summer days.

45,3665467,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac%20Goldsmith,Zac Goldsmith,"Frank Zacharias Robin Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith of Richmond Park,  (born 20 January 1975), is a British politician, life peer and journalist serving as Minister of State for the Pacific and the International Environment. A member of the Conservative Party, he was its candidate at the 2016 London mayoral election and was Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park from 2010 to 2016 and 2017 to 2019. Ideologically characterised as having liberal and libertarian views, he is known for his support for environmentalism and localism.

Born in London as a member of the Goldschmidt family, the son of billionaire businessman and financier James Goldsmith, he was educated at Eton College and the Cambridge Centre for Sixth-form Studies. In 1998, his uncle Edward Goldsmith made him editor of The Ecologist, a position he retained until 2007. Goldsmith was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Quality of Life Policy Group in 2005, co-authoring its report published in 2007. Goldsmith was placed on the Conservative ""A-List"" of potential candidates in 2006 and, in March 2007, was selected through an open primary to contest the constituency of Richmond Park against incumbent Liberal Democrat MP Susan Kramer. At the 2010 general election, he was elected to Parliament winning the seat with a majority of 4,091 votes.

At the 2015 general election, Goldsmith was returned to the Commons with a majority of 23,015, an increase of almost 19,000 votes since 2010, against his nearest opponent. He was chosen as the Conservative candidate for the 2016 election for mayor of London, which he subsequently lost to Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party. Goldsmith announced his resignation as an MP following the government's decision in October 2016 to approve construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport. His resignation triggered a by-election in the Richmond Park constituency in which Goldsmith stood as an independent candidate. He was defeated by Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats with a majority of 1,872 votes. After Theresa May called the 2017 general election, Goldsmith was reselected as the Conservative Party candidate for Richmond Park and won with a narrow majority of 45 votes.

Goldsmith was made Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment and International Development on 27 July 2019 and was promoted to Minister of State with the right to attend Cabinet on 10 September 2019. He was defeated at the 2019 general election, again by Sarah Olney, with a majority of 7,766 votes. After the election, Boris Johnson awarded Goldsmith with a life peerage, making him a member of the House of Lords and allowing him to retain his ministerial position. On 13 February 2020, he acquired the additional role of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the Pacific.

Early life and career

Goldsmith was born on 20 January 1975 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Chelsea, London. He is the middle child of Sir James Goldsmith, a member of the Goldsmith family of German Jewish and French descent, and his third wife, the Anglo-Irish aristocrat, Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart, the daughter of The 8th Marquess of Londonderry. Goldsmith has stated ""I was brought up by my father to identify very strongly as Jewish."" He was raised at Ormeley Lodge in Ham with his siblings, Jemima and Ben. He is half-brother to Robin and India Jane Birley, his mother's children from her first marriage. As a child, he was an avid reader of naturalist Gerald Durrell's works and developed a committed passion for David Attenborough's wildlife documentaries. He later recalled, ""He was my hero, and it was his work that made me fall in love with the natural world"". His ecological interests were nurtured further when his father gave him a copy of Helena Norberg-Hodge's book Ancient Futures, with a note saying: ""This will change your life"".

Goldsmith was educated at four independent schools: King's House School in Richmond and The Mall School in Twickenham, followed by Hawtreys School, near Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, and Eton College in Berkshire; he was expelled from Eton after drugs were found in his room. Goldsmith later said of the event ""Cannabis was found in my room. I was guilty throughout my time at school, but on this one occasion I was innocent. But it seemed pointless at the time to put up any resistance. I learned my lesson, I think you could say."" He went on to achieve four A-Levels at Cambridge Centre for Sixth-Form Studies.

Goldsmith travelled throughout the world with the International Honours Programme (courtesy of his uncle Edward Goldsmith), including to Thailand, New Zealand, Mexico, Hungary and Italy. Goldsmith lived in California for two years, working at first for the think tank Redefining Progress from 1995 to 1996, and later as a researcher for Norberg-Hodge's International Society for Ecology and Culture (ISEC) during 1996–98. While working with ISEC, Goldsmith travelled to India, spending a short time on an ashram in Rajasthan and later lived in Ladakh for six months, studying traditional cultures and helping run a tourist education programme.

In 1997, Goldsmith was appointed reviews editor of The Ecologist by his uncle Edward Goldsmith, the magazine's founding editor, owner and publisher. In 1998, he became editor-in-chief and director of The Ecologist but did not draw a salary. He relaunched The Ecologist on 28 March 2000 in a new format, transforming its academic journal-style into a current affairs-magazine format, thereby broadening its appeal and trebling its circulation. In January 2006, when assuming a post as the reviewer of the Conservative Party's environmental policies, it was announced that he was to step down as editor.

Political career

Joining the Conservatives: 2005–2010

Goldsmith joined the Conservative Party in 2005. He had previously supported the election campaigns of Michael Gove and Joanne Cash. He stated he regarded Labour as ""the party of big business"" which had become shaped by big lobbying groups and which had become too authoritarian and centrist. After the Conservatives lost the 2005 general election to Labour, they elected David Cameron as their new leader. Goldsmith thought highly of Cameron, expressing the view that while he was generally ""cynical about politicians"", he felt that Cameron was different. Describing Cameron, he said ""I don't know David Cameron very well... [but] I like him. I think you can judge a book by its cover... [and] I think the cover is pretty good."" At the 2005 Conservative annual conference, Goldsmith stated he saw no contradiction between his interest in environmental issues and being a Conservative.

In December 2005, David Cameron approved Goldsmith's appointment as deputy chairman of the Quality of Life Policy Group, under former Environment Secretary John Gummer. The group was tasked with examining matters such as carbon emissions, climate change, clean air and transport with a view to formulating Conservative policy. The group's 600-page report, jointly authored by Goldsmith and Gummer, was presented at the Royal Institute of British Architects on 13 September 2007. Its proposals included a moratorium on airport expansions; taxing short-haul flights and highly polluting vehicles, with proceeds being used to cut the cost of clean alternatives; and rebates on stamp duty and council tax for people who improved the energy efficiency of their homes. The report drew criticism from Labour, several Conservative politicians and the aviation industry. For Cameron, the report was an important part of rebranding the party to escape its reputation as the ""Nasty Party"" and pledged many of its recommendations would be included in the manifesto.

David Cameron recognised Goldsmith as a good prospective parliamentary candidate and in May 2006 placed him on the Conservative A-List of young and diverse candidates whom he wanted to stand at the 2010 general election. The Conservatives initially placed Goldsmith as their candidate for the safe seat of East Hampshire. Goldsmith felt uneasy about representing this constituency, with which he had no previous connection, and thus pulled out to avoid carpetbagging. He then entered the Richmond Park Conservative Association's open primary, which he won in March 2007.

In 2007, Goldsmith opposed the opening of a superstore by supermarket chain Sainsbury's in Barnes. He spearheaded a referendum conducted by the Electoral Reform Society to poll local residents on the issue, working closely with a local campaign group. With a turnout of 61.6%, more than 4,000 residents, who made up 85% of the votes cast, came forward to oppose the construction of the store at White Hart Lane. Sainsbury's ultimately opened the branch after revising its planning application.

In 2008 Goldsmith was asked to comment about donations of £7,000 to his Party while not on the electoral register. Commenting on the issue, Goldsmith explained: ""everything has been declared on time and accurately; however, for a few weeks last year I was not on the Electoral Roll, my name having been removed from Kensington and Chelsea's voter list, given that I was in the process of signing up for Richmond.  Whatever was donated in that time may have to be repaid, but there is no suggestion that anything other was improprietous"".

In late 2009, the press asserted that Goldsmith had non-domiciled status and that as a London resident, albeit a discretionary beneficiary, he had use of British properties through a trust set up by his late father. Goldsmith responded, in a statement about the suggestion of tax avoidance, that he has ""always chosen to be tax resident in the UK"" and virtually all his income was paid into British banks. Of non-dom status as a result of his late father's international status, Goldsmith added that he had already instructed his accountants to relinquish it of his own volition by early 2009. However, Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said that Goldsmith was likely to have avoided paying £580,000 per year for each year in the previous decade as a result of his non-dom status. In February 2016, The Evening Standard quoted Goldsmith stating that non-domiciled status let individuals ""make lifestyle choices to avoid paying tax"" and saying ""I've never been accused of not paying tax.""

In 2010, the Labour government sought to recover its expenditure on a programme of remedial works on the public car parks in Richmond Park through the introduction of parking fees for visitors to the royal park. Goldsmith organised a rally attended by over 1,000 people in the royal park on 30 January 2010 in conjunction with other local Conservatives to protest the proposed charging.

Parliamentary career: 2010–2015 
Goldsmith defeated the Liberal Democrat MP Susan Kramer in Richmond Park at the 2010 general election; he saw a 7% swing in the vote go to him. The election resulted in a hung parliament and the formation of a coalition government led by Cameron and the Conservatives. At the next general election, in May 2015, he increased his majority from 4,091 to 23,015 votes. He achieved an increase of 8.5 percent of the share of the vote from the 2010 general election, receiving a total of 58.2 percent of all votes cast by his constituents. This was the biggest increase in majority of any MP at the 2015 general election.

In July 2010, Channel 4 News questioned whether Goldsmith had under-reported the sums spent on signs, stickers and jackets used in his campaign and claimed his campaign spending was much higher than other MPs they investigated. They presented their case online including scans of the spending documents. He insisted he had followed the same procedures as other candidates and countered by stating Channel 4 engaged in sleazy unethical journalism. He argued expenditure was being spread across multiple campaigns: ""The formula we used is exactly the same formula ... as used by MPs and candidates around the country. Every decision we took was approved by electoral experts at Conservative Central Office"". It was debated whether signs that said ""Vote Zac Goldsmith"" and ""Vote Conservative"" could be charged to the election budget for a local election candidate when that other candidate was not mentioned on the sign. Goldsmith responded that it had been ""checked"" and was ""standard practice"" across the country. The second question was about jackets with ""I back Zac"" stickers on the back. ""They cost £2,168 but you only said you paid (spent) £170"". Goldsmith said the stickers cost £170 and the jackets were ""off the shelf"" and would be reused for other campaigns. Goldsmith clashed with presenter Jon Snow, who accused him of ""prevaricating"" in a confrontational live interview on Channel 4 News. Both parties criticised each other in the aftermath. Snow suggested Goldsmith take the matter to OFCOM, which rejected Goldsmith's complaint about Snow and Channel 4 News''' conduct.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism complained to the Electoral Commission over the report about Goldsmith's expenses. The Commission announced, following their initial 5-day assessment, they had decided to upgrade the investigation to the status of ""case under review"" and to make enquiries ""in order to establish the facts of the matter"". They reported in December 2010, deciding in ""the absence of any evidence of intentional circumvention of the rules, we do not consider that a referral to the police is appropriate."" However, they did observe the cost-sharing between general election and local election contests was ""not consistent with the Commission's guidance or good practice"", the submission was ""unclear in places"" and Goldsmith's campaign may have overspent by £966 in the short campaign.""Case Summary: Case review concerning campaign expenditure return in respect of Zac Goldsmith MP"" , The Electoral Commission website; accessed 16 May 2016.

Goldsmith co-ordinated a cross-party group of MPs to call for a Hillsborough-style inquiry into child sex abuse. He co-wrote a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May demanding a full independent inquiry with six other MPs: Tim Loughton, Tom Watson, Simon Danczuk, John Hemming, Tessa Munt and Caroline Lucas. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, initially rejected the call but was subsequently forced to concede, after 145 further MPs added their names to Goldsmith et al.s letter.

In December 2015, Goldsmith voted in support of the government's plans to expand the aerial bombing of Islamic State targets. He also endorsed a government bill that would have restricted trade unions in their ability to strike.

 London mayoral campaign 

Goldsmith had initially ruled out standing as a candidate in the 2016 London mayoral election, stating that ""I think people have had quite enough of white male Etonians"". However, as the election approached, it became apparent that he was the Conservatives' strongest potential candidate. On 9 June 2015, Goldsmith announced his interest in running for the mayoralty of London after encouragement both from members of his own party and others (notably the former Green Party Candidate Jenny Jones, Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb).London Evening Standard: Baroness Jones indicates Green Party support for Zac Goldsmith as Mayor  Before declaring himself as a nominee, Goldsmith spent around £50,000 of his own money sending a postal ballot to his 77,000 Richmond Park constituents, asking them if they would consent to him standing for Mayor. A majority who responded supported him. On 23 June 2015, he formally put his name forward with his three rivals being Andrew Boff, Syed Kamall, and Stephen Greenhalgh. The London Conservatives held an open primary, in which 9,227 votes were cast; of these, 6,514 went to Goldsmith. In October, Goldsmith's selection as Conservative Mayoral candidate was announced in a press release without accompanying ceremony.

During his campaign, Goldsmith repeatedly spoke out against proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. He stated that he was confident that the Cameron government would reject Heathrow expansion but that if they did not then he would resign as an MP and trigger a by-election. In July 2015, he also condemned the Airports Commission report written by the economist Howard Davies which backed Heathrow expansion; Goldsmith claimed that Davies had already decided on his conclusion before producing the three-year study. Davies responded by alleging that Goldsmith was lying, but the latter stood by his claim, as evidence citing that information he supplied to Davies' commission was not taken seriously.

A key issue in the campaign was London's housing shortage. To deal with the problem, Goldsmith suggested building ""high density, low-rise buildings which are in keeping with communities"" on publicly owned land currently controlled by the boroughs or Transport for London. He went against prevailing opinion in London by welcoming foreign investment into the property market, arguing that this investment could help to finance more house building. He ruled out supporting development on London's Green Belt, although stated that option might need to be considered in ten or fifteen years hence if the city's population continued to rise. He also suggested an expansion of the London congestion zone, and endorsed Boris Johnson's plans to construct a Garden Bridge across the River Thames.

Goldsmith hired Lynton Crosby's company to run his campaign and appointed Mark Fulbrook as his campaign director. Goldsmith's campaign emphasised connections between London Labour candidate Sadiq Khan and newly elected socialist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, despite Khan's own attempts to distance himself from Corbyn. Both the Conservative campaign and several Conservative-aligned newspapers sought to tar Khan as an apologist for, or even sympathiser with, Islamic extremism. Goldsmith's campaign material referred to Khan as ""radical and divisive"", while comments on the Conservatives' Facebook campaign material often displayed anti-Muslim sentiment.

Labour accused Goldsmith's campaign of using 'dog-whistle politics' and racist or Islamophobic campaigning. In April 2016, Labour MP Yvette Cooper wrote ""What started as a subtle dog-whistle is becoming a full blown racist scream"". Conservative politician Baroness Warsi also criticised Goldsmith for using an image of the bus destroyed in the 7/7 terrorist attacks to illustrate an article he wrote. Goldsmith was also accused of 'racial profiling' voters in the London mayoral campaign. Goldsmith strongly denied claims his campaign had been racist and accused his rival Khan of 'playing the race card'. The Conservatives responded it was ""utterly predictable that Labour label their opponents as racists"", citing the fact that during the 2008 mayoral campaign, the party had also accused Johnson of employing racist rhetoric.

Khan's campaign emphasised Goldsmith's comparative lack of political experience and employment history. Khan portrayed Goldsmith as a spoiled dilettante, stating that he ""never finished anything he starts ... he's somebody who before becoming a member of parliament has had one proper job, which was given to him by his uncle.""

Goldsmith went on to lose the election to Sadiq Khan in the second round by 315,529 votes. Khan achieved 57% of the vote to Goldsmith's 43% and polled a record number of votes after second round votes were counted. Goldsmith's campaign was later criticised by Labour MP David Lammy for being ""divisive"" by focusing on attempts to link Khan to Islamist extremists.

By-election and political return: 2016–2019
Goldsmith had promised, as far back as a June 2012 edition of the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, he would not stand as a Conservative candidate at the next election if the Conservative Party backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport, an issue to which he was strongly opposed. In December 2016, he lost a by-election in Richmond Park he had initiated by the act of resigning his seat. He stood as an independent instead of as a Conservative but was endorsed by UKIP who did not stand a candidate. He lost to Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats, who overturned his majority of 23,000.

In April 2017, Goldsmith was reselected as the Conservative Party candidate for Richmond Park prior to the upcoming snap general election to be held on 8 June. He regained the constituency as a Conservative candidate but winning with a majority of just 45 votes, the fifth-slimmest in the election. Following Boris Johnson's election as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister in July 2019, Goldsmith was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at both the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Department for International Development. After Amber Rudd's resignation as Work and Pensions Secretary in September 2019, Johnson reshuffled his frontbench and promoted Goldsmith to Minister of State with the right to attend Cabinet. Upon his promotion, he was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council, giving him the honorific title ""The Right Honourable"" for life. He appeared at number 98 on the 'Top 100 Most Influential Conservatives of 2019' by LBC's Iain Dale.

Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney defeated Goldsmith by 7,766 votes in the 12 December 2019 snap general election (despite the election providing the Conservative Party's largest share of votes since 1979) and won back the Richmond Park seat. Shortly after his electoral defeat, it was announced he would continue to serve as a minister in the government by being awarded a life peerage and sitting as a member of the House of Lords.

 House of Lords: 2019–present 
On 7 January 2020, Goldsmith was created Baron Goldsmith of Richmond Park', of Richmond Park in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. His ennoblement to the House of Lords was criticised by the Muslim Council of Britain as ""rewarding racism"", and by opposition politicians as being ""cronyist"" and ""hypocritical"" in light of a tweet Goldsmith had made in 2012 which described the House of Lords Reform Bill as being one that promoted ""party apparatchiks"" and ""insulated"" them from ""democratic pressure"". However, Labour MP and former Shadow Environment Secretary Kerry McCarthy said she believed Goldsmith was committed to the government's promise to maintain standards in environmental regulation after Brexit, adding: ""because of that I welcome the fact that he is still around to carry on and do that work"".

In his maiden speech in the House of Lords, Goldsmith rebutted accusations of cronyism, saying ""One political rival described me as a 'turd that won't flush' – a phrase my children are very unlikely to let me forget. But equally I know many of those heroic people engaged in the battle to protect this extraordinary planet and the species it holds are cheered by having another voice in Parliament and it is an enormous privilege.""

In Boris Johnson's post-Brexit reshuffle, Goldsmith was given the additional role of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the Pacific. In June 2020, Johnson announced the Department for International Development would be merged with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to form the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office which was subsequently created in September of that year.

On 1 June 2020, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards concluded Goldsmith had breached the standards commission's code of conduct by his use of publicly-funded stationery and postage for political purposes around 1 November 2019, shortly before the 2019 general election. The commission released a report in June upholding an allegation made against Goldsmith on 5 November 2019. The report said they had considered the ""timing, tone, and content of the letter and concluded that it was of a party-political nature rather than a communication for parliamentary purposes"". He accepted the commission's finding and agreed to re-pay £8,954.33 to cover the mailing costs.

Political positions and viewsThe Guardian described Goldsmith as ""a bit of a liberal and a bit of a libertarian"" on social issues, who has also gained a reputation for environmentalism due to his opposition to his government's plans to expand Heathrow airport. Journalist Dave Hill noted that the ""young Goldsmith was pro-small business and small communities, localist and conservationist"" and was ""against overbearing government from whatever the source"". Goldsmith has spoken and written about environmental causes in Britain and has twice been invited to debate at the Oxford Union, where he has delivered keynote addresses.

As a contributing author of the book We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, published in late 2009, Goldsmith has explored global diversities and threats facing humankind. Among the other contributors are western writers, such as Laurens van der Post, Noam Chomsky, Claude Lévi-Strauss and indigenous persons, such as Davi Kopenawa Yanomami and Roy Sesana. The book is composed of a collection of photographs, statements from tribal people, and essays from international authors, politicians, philosophers, poets, artists, journalists, anthropologists, environmentalists and photojournalists. In his essay, Goldsmith writes about how his travel around the world in his youth gave him first-hand experience of the misery brought by the promise of western ""progress"" and ""development"". He reflects on the culture of tribal people and, in reverence to it, urges people in the modern world to question what ""progress"" can really mean.

Goldsmith advocates greater direct democracy, such as Switzerland's model of using referendums. Goldsmith believes that direct democracy would help combat feelings of disenfranchisement among people and increase accountability. He has also argued in favour of introducing measures so that MPs can be subject to recall referendums midway through their term if a sufficiently large number of their constituents petition for it.

Goldsmith is a long-standing Eurosceptic and supporter of Brexit. He first announced he was in favour of the UK leaving the European Union in 2013 and has consistently voted against UK membership of the EU in Parliament. In March 2019, he was one of 265 Conservative MPs that backed a no-deal Brexit being left on the table.

Among Goldsmith's key interests is education; in an interview with Fairtrade fashion designers People Tree, he said ""I've put a big emphasis on schools. One campaign is to ensure every school [is] fitted with a proper kitchen that can double up as a classroom. Children need to know where their food comes from and how to cook it. We're also trying to help every school source its food sustainably and locally"".

Less than 24 hours after the 2017 Barcelona attacks, Goldsmith shared his brother's controversial post on social media which compared ISIS's antisemitism to that of the left-wing British campaign group Momentum.

Fundraising

Goldsmith funded the Organic Targets Bill Campaign to promote organic farming in 1999. He has been a member of the advisory board of the JMG Foundation, which disburses grants globally to a range of environmental advocacy groups using the financial legacy left by James Goldsmith. He is also on the National Gardens Scheme's Council of Trustees as one of four Ambassadors. He is a Patron of the Mihai Eminescu Trust which conserves and maintains communities in Transylvania and the Maramureş, and the philanthropic organization, Fortune Forum (together with Jimmy Wales). He is a longstanding donor to the Soil Association. In 2007, he was a participant at the Soil Association Annual Conference, during which he competed in an organic fashion show on 25 January and afterwards debating on a Question Time panel on 27 January.

Family and personal life

Goldsmith has been described as having a ""soft voice and unhurried manner"". Referring to Goldsmith's actions in the 2016 Mayoral campaign, journalist Dave Hill described Goldsmith as ""the courtly patrician who [would have] hired a heavy mob to do his fighting for him"".

After his father's death in 1997, Goldsmith is believed to have inherited between £200 million and £300 million out of the reported £1.2 billion estate. In a 2009 article in The Guardian, some tax experts speculated his income could amount to £5 million per year from the trust left to him alone. He was the second richest member in the 2010–2015 Parliament after Richard Benyon. He enjoys gambling; in 2004 he won £53,000 in a televised card game and he has had a financial stake in the Mayfair-based bookmakers Fitzdares. A backgammon and poker player, he also pursues other sporting interests including cricket.

Goldsmith was married for ten years to Sheherazade Ventura-Bentley with whom he has three children: two daughters, Uma Romaine and Thyra, and a son, James. The couple married on 5 June 1999 at St Simon Zelotes Church in London. The Goldsmith couple separated in April 2009, and received a decree nisi on 10 May 2010. Sheherazade and Goldsmith were featured in Vanity Fair 67th Annual International Best-Dressed List among ""Best-Dressed Couples"". Goldsmith said in 2000 that he wore Savile Row suits which had belonged to his late father. His divorce from Ventura-Bentley was much covered in the gossip columns.

Goldsmith married banking heiress Alice Rothschild in 2013 at London Wetland Centre in his constituency. They have a daughter, Dolly Goldsmith, born in July 2013. Their second child, a son named Max, was born in January 2016. On 25 April 2017, Alice gave birth to a daughter named Edie. Alice's sister, Kate Rothschild, and his brother, Ben Goldsmith, had been married until 2012. He and his family live in Barnes.

 Awards 

 In 2003, Goldsmith was awarded the Beacon Prize as Young Philanthropist of the Year for his contribution to environmental awareness and protection.
 In 2004, he received the Mikhail Gorbachev-founded Green Cross International's Global Green Award for International Environmental Leadership.
 In 2011, he was joint winner of the inaugural BusinessGreen Politician of the Year Award with Tim Yeo MP.
 In 2014, he was also awarded by The Patchwork Foundation for being The Best Conservative Newcomer MP of the Year.

Ancestry
Goldsmith is a member of the prominent Goldsmith family. Goldsmith's family has a long history in politics. His grandfathers were both Conservative Members of Parliament: his paternal grandfather, Frank Goldsmith, was a Conservative MP, while his mother's father, The 8th Marquess of Londonderry, represented County Down as a Unionist MP in the British House of Commons, when he was still styled Viscount Castlereagh. His maternal great-grandfather, The 7th Marquess of Londonderry, was an Ulster Unionist politician. Another maternal ancestor was Robert, Viscount Castlereagh, Chief Secretary for Ireland and British Foreign Secretary.

Production

Development 
The film was launched on 8 October 2019 on the occasion of Vijayadasami tentatively titled as #Chiru152. The film marks the maiden collaboration of Chiranjeevi with the director Koratala Siva. The title was accidentally revealed as Acharya by Chiranjeevi during audio launch of the film O Pitta Katha on 1 March 2020.

Mani Sharma is composing the film's music. Cinematography and editing are performed by Tirru and Naveen Nooli respectively. Suresh Selvarajan is the art director.

In January 2022, Asianet News reported that the film is based on the Naxalite movement in the Srikakulam district led by poet and cultural activist Subbarao Panigrahi.

Casting 
Trisha was cast in a lead role but she walked out of the film citing creative differences. Makers approached Kajal Aggarwal instead and Aggarwal confirmed that she was doing the film. There were reports that Mahesh Babu was approached for an extended cameo. However, Chiranjeevi confirmed that his son Ram Charan would be doing the role and Koratala Siva adjusted the role to make it as a full length role. Pooja Hegde is cast opposite Charan. Regina Cassandra was signed for a special song in March 2020.

Filming 
Principal photography began in January 2020. Important portions were shot with Chiranjeevi and others at Ramoji Film City. The filming was going at a brisk pace until it was suspended in March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. The filming resumed in November 2020, and Kajal Aggarwal joined the sets of the film in Hyderabad in December 2020. A temple town set spanning 20 acres was built for the film.

Ram Charan joined the production in January 2021, whose character is revealed as Siddha. The film team, including Chiranjeevi, have reached Rajahmundry in January 2021. In March 2021, Pooja Hegde began filming her portions with a montage song taking place at a specially-constructed set in Maredumilli. A schedule is planned to take place at Singareni coal mines, Yellandu later that month. Following the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India, filming was indefinitely paused till June 2021. In July 2021, filming was resumed in at a village set constructed in Hyderabad. Chiranjeevi joined the production on the same day. Charan resumed his part of filming the same month. Except for two songs, the rest of the filming was completed in August 2021.

Legal issue 
In August 2020, writer Rajesh Manduri alleged that Acharya was plagiarized from his script. He supposedly narrated the story to production house Mythri Movie Makers a few years ago which did not materialize. Mythri Movie Makers refuted the allegation, calling it a ""gimmick."" Matinee Entertainment stated that any such claims were baseless, iterating that the story of Acharya belongs to Koratala. Koratala responded that his story had no resemblance to Manduri's.

Soundtrack

The film's soundtrack album is composed by Mani Sharma.

Release
Initially scheduled to be released on 13 May 2021, it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The film was scheduled to be released theatrically on 4 February 2022 but was postponed to 1 April 2022 due to the pandemic. Finally, the film is scheduled to be released theatrically on 29 April 2022 due to a mutual agreement with the makers of RRR to postpone the film.

City nicknames can help in establishing a civic identity, helping outsiders recognize a community or attracting people to a community because of its nickname; promote civic pride; and build community unity. Nicknames and slogans that successfully create a new community ""ideology or myth"" are also believed to have economic value. Their economic value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by ""branding"" themselves by adopting new slogans.

Some unofficial nicknames are positive, while others are derisive. The unofficial nicknames listed here have been in use for a long time or have gained wide currency.

The piece was intended to be sung by the  Frohsinn for the Joyous Entry of Elisabeth of Bavaria, then the bride of Franz Joseph of Austria, known as Sisi, in Linz on 22 April 1854. However, Bruckner's composition was not performed, but instead a transcription of the Bavarian national hymn with the same text by Hillischer.

Another text by Anton August Naaf, """" (To you, lovely homeland, should sound the faithful song of highest love), was used for the music for a performance of the Wiener Schubertbund on 15 June 1898.

Later again, another text was put by Anton Weiss for the Wiener Schubertbund. Bruckner's autograph manuscript is stored in the archive of the Oberösterreichisches Landesarchiv.

A facsimile of the work with Naaf's text was first published in band III/2, pp. 162–179 of the Göllerich/Auer biography, with Hillischer's original text in footnote. The work is put with the original text only in XXIII/2, No. 10 of the .

Text 

The text used for the cantata is by Hillischer:

Music 
The 100-bar long work in E-flat major is scored for  choir and brass instruments (2 horns, 2 trumpets and 4 trombones).

The work consists of two related sections and a coda. While the horns and the trumpets are used only to contribute brief fanfare, pedal tones, and occasionally to the roots of otherwise incomplete chords, the four trombones almost always double the voices. Like other Bruckner's works, the work begins with a distinctive motive that provides much of the ensuing musical material. Obvious derivatives of this motive form the beginning and the ending of each section, and all of the imitative passages are based on developments of it. Since no two statements of this tune are identical, it provides both musical unity and variety. The music is of substantial interest, because it contains an attractive blend of progressive and textural variety.

59,54033523,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz%20Felsch,Heinz Felsch,"Heinz Felsch (born 14 July 1922 in Weißenfels/Saale, Germany, died 14 March 2016 in Halle an der Saale, Germany) was a German painter and graphic artist. He created a comprehensive oeuvre of oil paintings and mixed media. Since he had also trained as a lithographer, he produced a large number of lithographic prints in his own printing workshop. The themes of his paintings and graphic oeuvre are landscapes, still lives, and also portraits and people.

After completing school, Felsch did an apprenticeship in merchandising, which he could not complete due to the start of World War II. At the age of seventeen, he was enlisted into the German army and was moved to France, where he served as the chauffeur for a higher-ranking officer. After his first year in France, he was destined to be sent to Africa but instead was transferred to Russia, where he flew reconnaissance flights with the German air force. During one of the missions, he suffered a serious head injury which rendered him unfit to serve and he ended up in a hospital in Denmark where he stayed until the end of the war.

After the war, Felsch moved back to his hometown, Weißenfels. He started an apprenticeship as a lithographer. In 1946, he enrolled as a student at the art school Burg Giebichenstein in Halle and joined the art class with the teacher Professor Charles Crodel.  

Felsch became part of group of painters which is now known as the “Hallesche Schule” (school of Halle). It was a movement of modern painting during a period from 1945 until the late 1950s, under the influence of the professors of fine art Charles Crodel and Erwin Hahs. The term “Hallesche Schule” describes a specific regional movement rooted in classic modern art.

Felsch had a close personal and artistic bond with the painter Albert Ebert, which started when both met as art students and continued until Ebert died in 1976. This close artistic bond is reflected in many of his paintings.

When Crodel was appointed professor for Fine Art at the Munich Art Academy in 1951, he asked Felsch to join him as his assistant and lithographer. After some consideration, he decided to stay in Halle due to family circumstances.

In 1949, Felsch married his fellow student Brigitte Reiff. They both met at art school, as Brigitte was part of the same group of students under Crodel. They had a son and two daughters.

Felsch and his wife regularly spent the summer months during the late 1940s to the mid-1950s in Ahrenshoop, a little fishing village on the Baltic Sea, known for their artist community. A number of paintings, drawings and lithographic prints originate from this time and reflect the partly rough but also gentle landscapes between the sea, with its dunes and cliffs, and the Bodden laguna.

Felsch, with the support of his wife, worked on larger scale commissions of architectural art from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, which were mainly mosaic wall friezes in the lobbies of newly built hospitals and schools. There are still two of the previously three larger wall mosaics in the lift lobbies of the Policlinic Reil in Halle. A further 17-meter long wall mosaic frieze can still be seen in a school in Braunsbedra near Halle.

In the late 1970s when their commercial opportunities were not as plentiful, the couple started to produce their own range of small ceramic medallions and ceramic jewellery, which helped to support them financially.

Felsch carried on painting right up into his 90s. He particularly took pride in the frames of his paintings, which were meticulously made and most of them applied with a layer of flat silver.

In 1951, Felsch became a member of the Landesverband Bildender Künstler Sachsen-Anhalt (National Association of Fine Arts of Sachsen-Anhalt) and in 1952, he became member of the ‘Verband Bildender Künstler der DDR’ (National Association of Fine Arts of the GDR). 
He took part in numerous group exhibitions throughout Germany to include earlier participation in the art exhibitions of the GDR.

Kewa pandanus register
Kewa's elaborate pandanus avoidance register, which is used only in the forest during the karuka harvest, has been extensively documented. The grammar is regularized and the vocabulary is restricted, with about a thousand words that differ from normal language. This was first described by Karl J. Franklin in 1972.

Pandanus-register words have a broader semantic scope. For example, yoyo, a reduplication of yo 'leaf', refers to hair, ear, breast, and scrotum, all things which hang from the body as pandanus leaves hang from the tree. Palaa, 'limb,' (either thigh or branch) is used for any reference to trees, including root, firewood, and fire. (Even in normal Kewa, repena means both 'tree' and 'fire'.) Maeye or 'crazy' refers to any non-human animal except dogs. It contrasts with the rational world of humans.

Many words are coined from Kewa morphology but have idiosyncratic meanings in the forest. Aayagopa, from aa 'man', yago 'fellow', and pa 'to do, to make', refers to man, knee, skin, and neck. Many idiosyncratic phrases are then built on this word. For example, ni madi aayagopa-si (I carry man-) means ""my father"".

The grammar has also been simplified. Clause-linking morphology is lost and replaced by simple juxtaposition of the clauses. In standard Kewa, there are two sets of verbal endings, one indicating actions done for the speaker's benefit. That set is missing from the pandanus language. The other inflection differs somewhat. For example, the forms of 'to be' are:

(The -nu in aayagopanu is a collective suffix.)

62,18294054,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%20Gaon,Simon Gaon,"Simon Gaon (born 1943) is an American painter, Expressionist, and action painter. He is best known for his intense, tempestuous, action oriented paintings of the cityscape.  He was also a co-founder of the Street Painters, a group of eight New York City artists who painted directly from the city life they observed on the streets of America's largest city.

Early life and education

Born in 1943 in Manhattan, Gaon at an early age displayed creative talents. By age 14, he began painting while attending the Roosevelt School in Stamford, Connecticut. A key influence on him was painter Arthur Bressler (1927–1975) who was Gaon's teacher and mentor. Gaon graduated from the High School of Art and Design in New York City. In 1962, Gaon won the art studio award scholarship from the Art Students League which allowed him to study art on the European continent. In 1964, he studied in Academia 63 in Haarlem, the Netherlands, and furthered his European education with the Art Students League Merit Scholarship (1965) and the Edward G. McDowell traveling scholarship

He later stayed more than ten years in Europe, primarily in Paris, where his style evolved. The works of the Fauve painters - Derain, Vlaminck as well as Soutine, Kokoschka, Corinth, and especially Van Gogh have all strongly influenced his work.

Gaon's philosophy and style

In his work, Gaon is influenced more by his temperament than intellectualism. He prefers to take risks, and edit later, putting the living experience of painting at the forefront of his craft. As an action painter, he immerses himself physically in his art, using pigment, emotion, and poetry to reinvent nature in a personal way. He paints nature and the city with abandonment and freedom, harnessing the different layers of the subconscious to help form the painting. However, life in all its energy and contradiction remains his inspiration. Subjects of his art include the night, the stormy sea, and the frenetic, carnival-like neon-lit city.

Art

Gaon is most famous for his Time Square series, (1998) displaying the chaos and confusion of city. His depictions of the locale have been called dizzying, disorienting and even mind-boggling. His works manifest the vitality, wildness, diverseness, and hysterical quality of the urban setting, ever expanding to the point of explosion. Gaon's chaotic Time Square, helps him, as an artist, express the contradictory life forces that live within him.

Gaon also focuses on those who live on the urban periphery, the street people, immigrants, and prostitutes. His paintings go beyond the immediate perception of these subjects, to uncover the inherent contradictions both in his subjects psyche and social position, and in his own consciousness. His subjects display a noble and prophetic character, as if spiritually from a bygone era, yet awkwardly entrenched in a harsh contemporary reality.

63,61891271,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anya%20Samek,Anya Samek,"Anya Savikhin Samek is an economist who works in the fields of applied economics, behavioral economics, experimental economics, and household economics. She is currently an associate professor (research) of economics at the University of Southern California.

Career 
Samek graduated from Purdue University in 2005 with her B.A. in economics summa cum laude, and then went on to receive her M.S. in economics in 2006 from the Krannert School of Management. She received her PhD in economics from Purdue in 2010. In April 2010, she was invited by the University of Chicago to be a postdoctoral research scholar. In 2014 she continued her work for the University of Chicago as a visiting assistant professor. After three years as an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison, Samek became an associate professor of economics at the University of Southern California (USC) in 2015 where to continues to work as of present. At USC, Samek holds a joint appointment in both the Centre for Economic and Social Research and the department of economics. She is also the director of the Behavioral and Experimental Economics (BEE) Research Group.

Work 
Samek's work on various economics topics, including charitable giving, education, and health, includes over 100 academic publications.

Charitable giving 
Samek's work in charitable giving, among other topics, looks at what affects the decisions of donors in the act of giving.

Social pressure effect 
Samek and Chuan explored how the manipulation of allowing a donor to give a card along with their donation, an act meant to add meaning to the transaction, affects their giving rates. It was discovered that this manipulation caused a social pressure effect as ""small donors feel that they should be donating more"" and thus refrains them from donating all together.

Selective recognition 
In 2013, Samek and Sheremeta investigated how the act of recognizing donors affects the extent of contributions to public goods. They found that recognizing all or solely the lowest donors significantly increases contributions, while recognizing the highest donors has no effect on the extent of contribution at all. It was concluded from the study that ""aversion from shame"" is more powerful than ""anticipation of prestige"".

Education 
Among other papers, Samek's work analyzes how different modes of education can effect early childhood learning and adult financial decision-making.

Improving financial literacy 
Samek, along with Lusardi, Kapteyn, Glinert, Hung, and Heinberg, evaluated different mediums of educational programs aimed at to educate adults about risk diversification. The work cites risk diversification as an ""essential concept for financial decision-making"". Their research found that videos are the most effective means of communicating financial literacy, which highlighted the power of online media in educating and altering the decisions of recipients.

Academic achievement gap 
In 2012, Samek helped launch a large-scale project called the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center (CHECC). Samek and a team of scholars sought to understand the academic achievement gap and how early childhood education interventions may reduce it. The research found that preschool programs and incentives to parents lead to large reductions in the academic achievement gap.

Samek said this about her work at CHECC:The CHECC results not only allow us to provide quality early childhood education but also help inform us about how to most effectively develop early childhood programs. We are excited to move forward as we continue to provide the Chicago Heights community quality early childhood programming.

Health 
Samek's work on health includes examination of the effects of interventions in the decision-making of children in regards to food choice.

Prompts 
Over several weeks, Samek, List, and Lai ran an experiment aimed at better understanding how prompts affect the food-choice of children. They discovered that when nudges by cafeteria workers are applied, children are more likely to opt for white milk relative to sugar-sweetened chocolate milk.

Individual incentives and educational messaging 
Samek and List analyzed how individual incentives and educational messaging affect the food choice of children. They discovered that when the two interventions were applied in tandem, they held an important influence in increasing the rate at which children opt for healthier snacks. Notably, the research showed that the effects of the experiment continued to spill over after its completion, suggesting that individual incentives and education messaging encourages habit-building among children.

65,2288688,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakey%20the%20robot,Shakey the robot,"Shakey the Robot was the first general-purpose mobile robot able to reason about its own actions. While other robots would have to be instructed on each individual step of completing a larger task, Shakey could analyze commands and break them down into basic chunks by itself.

Due to its nature, the project combined research in robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing. Because of this, it was the first project that melded logical reasoning and physical action. Shakey was developed at the Artificial Intelligence Center of Stanford Research Institute (now called SRI International).

Some of the most notable results of the project include the A* search algorithm, the Hough transform, and the visibility graph method.

History
Shakey was developed from approximately 1966 through 1972 with Charles Rosen, Nils Nilsson and Peter Hart  as project managers. Other major contributors included  Alfred Brain,  Sven Wahlstrom, Bertram Raphael, Richard Duda, Richard Fikes, Thomas Garvey,  Helen Chan Wolf and Michael Wilber. The project was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Now retired from active duty, Shakey is currently on view in a glass display case at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The project inspired numerous other robotics projects, most notably the Centibots.

Software

The robot's programming was primarily done in LISP. The Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS) planner it used was conceived as the main planning component for the software it utilized. As the first robot that was a logical, goal-based agent, Shakey experienced a limited world. A version of Shakey's world could contain a number of rooms connected by corridors, with doors and light switches available for the robot to interact with.

Shakey had a short list of available actions within its planner. These actions involved traveling from one location to another, turning the light switches on and off, opening and closing the doors, climbing up and down from rigid objects, and pushing movable objects around. The STRIPS automated planner could  devise a plan to enact all the available actions, even though Shakey himself did not have the capability to execute all the actions within the plan personally.

An example mission for Shakey might be something like:

""An operator types the command ""push the block off the platform"" at a computer console. Shakey looks around, identifies a platform with a block on it, and locates a ramp in order to reach the platform. Shakey then pushes the ramp over to the platform, rolls up the ramp onto the platform, and pushes the block off the platform. Mission accomplished.""

Hardware
Physically, the robot was particularly tall, and had an antenna for a radio link, sonar range finders, a television camera, on-board processors, and collision detection sensors (""bump detectors""). The robot's tall stature and tendency to shake resulted in its name:

Research results

The development of Shakey had a far-reaching impact on the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as computer science in general. Some of the more notable results include the development of the A* search algorithm, which is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting an efficiently traversable path between points; the Hough transform, which is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing; and the visibility graph method for finding Euclidean shortest paths among obstacles in the plane.

Media and awards

After SRI published a 24-minute video in 1969 entitled ""SHAKEY: Experimentation in Robot Learning and Planning"", the project received significant media attention. This included an April 10, 1969 article in the New York Times; In 1970, Life referred to Shakey as the ""first electronic person""; and in November 1970 National Geographic Magazine covered Shakey and the future of computers. The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence's AI Video Competition's awards are named ""Shakeys"" because of the significant impact of the 1969 video.

Shakey was inducted into Carnegie Mellon University's Robot Hall of Fame in 2004 alongside such notables as ASIMO and C-3PO.

Shakey has been honored with a prestigious IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing.

Shakey was showcased in the BBC – Towards Tomorrow: Robot (1967) documentary.

66,2267756,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques%20Miller,Jacques Miller,"Jacques Francis Albert Pierre Miller AC FRS FAA (born 2 April 1931) is a French-Australian research scientist. He is known for having discovered the function of the thymus and for the identification, in mammalian species of the two major subsets of lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) and their function.

Early life and education
Miller was born on 2 April 1931 in Nice, France, as J.F.A.P. Meunier, and grew up in France, Switzerland and China, mostly in Shanghai. After the outbreak of World War II, in anticipation of Japan's entry into the war, his family moved in 1941 to Sydney, Australia, and changed their last name to ""Miller"". He was educated at St Aloysius' College in Sydney, where he met his future colleague, Sir Gustav Nossal.

Miller studied medicine at the University of Sydney, and had his first experience of laboratory research in the laboratory of Professor Patrick de Burgh where he studied virus infection.

Career
In 1958, Miller travelled to the United Kingdom on a Gaggin Research Fellowship from the University of Queensland. He was accepted to the Chester Beatty Research Institute of Cancer Research (part of the Institute of Cancer Research, London) and as a PhD student at the University of London. Miller chose to study the pathogenesis of lymphocytic leukemia in mice, expanding on the research of Ludwik Gross into murine leukemia virus. Miller showed that experimental animals without a thymus at birth were incapable of rejecting foreign tissues and resisting many infections, thus demonstrating that the thymus is vital for development and function of the adaptive immune system. Prior to this, the thymus was believed to be a vestigial organ with no function. His discovery has led many to describe Miller as the ""world's only living person who can claim to have been the first to have described the functions of a human organ"". In 1963, Miller continued his work into the function of the thymus at the National Institutes of Health.

In 1966, Miller returned to Australia to become a research group leader at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, at the invitation of its new director Sir Gustav Nossal, the successor of Sir Macfarlane Burnet. There, with student Graham Mitchell, he discovered that mammalian lymphocytes can be separated into what were later called T cells and B cells, and that these interact to allow normal antibody production (T cell help). Miller went on to show that the thymus produces the T cells, that it removes autoreactive T cells (central T cell tolerance) and several other landmark findings in immunology. These are considered crucial to understanding diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity and AIDS, as well as processes such as transplant rejection, allergy and antiviral immunity. Miller was also the first to provide evidence that thymus-derived immune cells are important for the defense against certain tumors, which forms the basis for modern cancer immunotherapy.

Semi-retired since 1996, Miller is still involved in immunological research.

Miller has had a longstanding interest in art, and studied art in the 1980s. His art has been exhibited at venues in Melbourne.

67,43459536,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese%20in%20Mississippi,Vietnamese in Mississippi,"Mississippi has a Vietnamese American population. As of 2010 7,025 ethnic Vietnamese live in Mississippi, making up 0.2% of the people there.

History
Vietnamese came to the United States as a result of the Vietnam War, with many coming beginning 1975. Many Vietnamese fisherpeople who fled from the war settled in areas where they could resume their fishing activities, including the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The Biloxi community needed employees for oyster factories, so many Vietnamese began working there. The seafood jobs did not require a significant fluency in English, attracting the immigrants.

The ethnic Vietnamese population grew over 100% between 1980 and 1990. The state had 5,387 ethnic Vietnamese by 2000.

In 2005 Hurricane Katrina affected Vietnamese communities along the Gulf of Mexico.

The Vietnamese statewide population was 7,025 as of 2010.

The Vietnamese living along the Gulf of Mexico were affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.

Geography
As of 2010 the largest group of Vietnamese live along the Gulf of Mexico in Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson counties. As of 2010 the Gulfport-Biloxi area has about 5,000 Vietnamese Americans. As of the same year over 50% of the state's Vietnamese reside in Harrison County. In 2005, prior to Hurricane Katrina, about 2,500 Vietnamese lived in East Biloxi, where there was a single community with Vietnamese businesses, a Buddhist temple, and a Vietnamese Catholic church. Most of the Vietnamese there lived in low-lying areas. The community sustained damages during Katrina. Some Vietnamese had relocated to D'Iberville.

As of 2010 the Jackson metropolitan area has the second largest Vietnamese population in the state and the Hattiesburg, Mississippi area has the state's third largest Vietnamese population. Jamie Bounds of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History wrote that ""The counties bordering the Mississippi River, particularly those in the northwest section of the state, have a measurable Vietnamese population.""

70,68434812,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman%20Dinerstein,Norman Dinerstein,"Norman Myron Dinerstein (September 18, 1937 – December 23, 1982) was an American composer and pedagogue.

Life and career
A native of Springfield, Massachusetts, Dinerstein received his bachelor's degree in music from Boston University in 1960; this was followed by a master's in music from the Hartt College of Music in 1963, and a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1974. He also studied at the Hochschule für Musik Berlin (1926–63); the Berkshire Music Center (1962 and 1963); and the Darmstadt Summer School (1964). He considered Arnold Franchetti to be his most important instructor; others under whom he studied included Witold Lutosławski, Gunther Schuller, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss, Roger Sessions, and Milton Babbitt. From 1965 to 1966 he taught at Princeton University; he was on the faculty of the New England Conservatory from 1968 to 1969 and again from 1970 until 1971; he was chairman of composition and theory at Hartt College from 1971 until 1976, and from 1976 until 1981 held the chairmanship of composition, musicology, and theory at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. In the latter year he became dean, holding the position until his death. He was a Fulbright Scholar in Argentina from 1969 until 1970. Among his pupils was Thomas L. McKinley. Dinerstein was married to soprano Nelga Lynn Dinerstein, with whom he had two sons, Jonathan and Alexander; all three survived him. He died in his home in Cincinnati, and is interred in the Adath Israel Cemetery in Price Hill, Cincinnati.

Early in his career Dinerstein produced music that was mainly tonal and lyrical. Coming under the influence of his teacher Franchetti, he began in 1961 to compose in a freely atonal and dissonant style; a notable work in this vein is the 1971 Refrains for orchestra. Later in his career he returned to tonality in his music; pieces exemplifying this change include Zalmen for violin (1975); Songs of Remembrance for soprano and strings (1976-1979), a commission to celebrate the bicentennial of the United States; and Hashkivenu for tenor, chorus, and double bass (1981). All are among his works on Jewish themes. By the end of his career Dinerstein was continuing to simplify his technique, evident in such works as Golden Bells for chorus and orchestra, the second movement of a planned four-movement setting of ""The Bells"" by Edgar Allan Poe. This work was completed posthumously by Michael Schelle, and was premiered by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra under Michael Gielen. Composers cited as an influence on Dinerstein's choral music include Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg.

71,3204652,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern%20Foods,Northern Foods,"Northern Foods is a British food manufacturer headquartered in Wakefield, England. It was formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the original FTSE 100 Index. The company is credited, together with Marks & Spencer, with creating the UK Chilled Food category. The driver of this growth was Christopher Haskins, the son-in-law of the company’s founder Alec Horsley. Haskins became a director in 1967, deputy chairman in 1974, and was chairman from 1980 to 2002. The company was delisted in 2011 when it was bought by the 2 Sisters company.

History

20th century
The business was founded by Alec Horsley in 1937 as a family-run dairy business based in Holme on Spalding Moor. During the war years, Horsley bought up many competing local dairies to become a major dairy force in the Humber region. In 1942, the business was registered as Northern Dairies and became a public company in 1956. In 1958, Alec's son Nicholas Horsley joined the then Northern Dairies as a trainee manager, becoming a director in 1963. His first great business success was to acquire, very cheaply, a stake in a small ice-cream company called Mr Whippy, which he sold on to Charles Forte for a very high price two years later.

The dairy was generating large amounts of cash, as many dairies were at the time, due to the government backed guaranteed pricing created by the Milk Marketing Board, itself a legacy of post-war food shortages. That cash was used to fund diversification into foods. In 1972, Northern Dairies changed its name to Northern Foods. Nick Horsley’s brother-in-law, Christopher Haskins found himself on a plane next to Marks & Spencer (M&S) executive who was setting up a new store in Belfast. M&S began buying milk for the store from Northern Foods, followed by yoghurt deliveries and food, including the first fresh trifle for M&S. The contract developed into food sales to M&S that were eventually worth over half a billion pounds a year. Northern Foods also made some non-competing products for other retailers. Since then its strategy has been to buy up and consolidate M&S suppliers.

In 1986, Northern Foods built Fenlands Food Factory, for £8 million, dedicated entirely to M&S. At the time it was regarded as the most advanced food factory in Europe.

Nick Horsley had successfully diversified the business, widening  Northern Foods' portfolio into Marks & Spencer cakes (through Park Cakes), Smith's Flour Milling, brewing (with the purchase of Hull Brewery), Fox's Biscuits, Pork Farms and many other smaller firms. It was during this period that the company pioneered the market in chilled, prepared meals and sandwiches in supermarkets.

In 1987, the company built the most advanced food factory in Europe, the Fenlands Food Factory in Grantham, and dedicated it entirely to Marks & Spencer.

Nicholas Horsley took early retirement due to a rare genetic wasting disease, and by 1986, Haskins had become chairman of Northern Foods. In 1994, the Milk Marketing Board was abolished and milk prices in supermarkets fell. The loss of the high return on milk made a measurable impact on all dairy companies including Northern Foods. Northern Foods demerged Express Dairies in 1998 as the depressed margins were dragging the share price down of the overall group. Both businesses were listed to the FTSE 250. Express Dairies was later bought by in a staged acquisition, finalised in 2003, by Arla Amba a Danish and Swedish co-operative.

21st century 
Christopher Haskins stepped down as CEO in 2002 with Jo Stewart succeeding him. In March 2004, Patricia O’Driscol, who had previously worked for Tesco’s chilled business and Shell, was hired to replace Stewart.

In July 2004, M&S was subject to a takeover bid from Philip Green. This was rejected by M&S which, partly as a result of shareholder pressure, decided to be more transactional in its supplier relationships and started to take volume out of the Northern Foods factories to diversify its supply base. Four profit warnings followed.

In 2005, O’Driscoll embarked on a radical restructuring programme. In February 2006, she hired Stefan Barden, formerly CEO of Heinz UK&I, to support the restructuring as CEO designate. They completed the restructuring that year selling the dedicated chilled distribution (NFT), flour milling (Smiths), cakes (Park Cakes), speciality bread (Fletchers) and chilled pastry businesses (Pork Farms Bowyers) were also sold to a private equity group, Vision Capital. Lastly, the Green Isle Boyle site and its Trafford Park Bakery were also closed with production either consolidated into other factories within its footprint or moved to other manufacturers such as Ginsters. The restructuring complete, O’Driscoll stepped down and Barden took over as CEO in 2007. The next 16 quarters saw sales growth and margin expansion during a period of continued supply over capacity, volatile commodity prices and significant customer pricing pressure.

Whereas trading was now performing well, a major issue for Northern Foods’ had become its large Pension Scheme, which since the 2008 financial crisis, had moved from being in surplus to having a sizeable £150m deficit. A merger of equals with Greencore was proposed to help address this, but the Pension fund preferred the protections given in an alternative offer by 2 Sisters PLC; which successfully consummated the acquisition in May 2011.

On 13 May 2011 the company was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. The Northern Foods factories continue to trade with the UK major supermarkets from within the 2 Sisters group.

On 11 September 2020 Northern Foods sold the famous Fox biscuit brand to Ferrero, an Italian multinational specialized in the production of chocolate and snacks.

76,42297442,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer%20contagion,Peer contagion,"Peer contagion refers to the ""mutual influence that occurs between an individual and a peer"", and ""includes behaviors and emotions that potentially undermine one's own development or cause harm to others"". Peer contagion refers to the transmission or transfer of deviant behavior from one adolescent to another. It can take many forms, including aggression, bullying, weapon carrying, disordered eating, drug use and depression. It can happen in natural settings where peer dealings occur as well as in intervention and education programs.

Awareness of influence is uncommon and it is often not intentional. Rather ""they engage in relationship behaviors that satisfy immediate needs for an audience or companionship"" unintentionally. Many processes of peer contagion have been suggested, including deviancy training.

Deviancy training 

In the context of deviance, peer contagion attributes the ""activity and result of youth conversations"" to the ""promotion of deviant behavior"" typical of  ""youth  that are in peer groups who have little structure or supervision""

Other possible avenues 

Social learning theorists suggest that peer contagion happens after the observation of deviant behavior amid social reinforcement. Normative socialization is the process by which adolescents try to remove dissimilarities between themselves and other youth. Friendship selection is the process of youth choosing deviant peer groups because of shared interests.

Some researchers claim that one dynamic of peer contagion may precede adolescent friendships. Adolescents may adopt behaviors with the expectation that this will lead to friendship or acceptance in a peer group. Evidence also exists that adolescents seek out peer groups based on mood and that connecting with a group with a similar mood will tend to intensify it.

Peer groups also tend to feed off of themselves, without member awareness, pressuring members to become more homogeneous over time, through the reinforcement of verbal expressions, particularly involving a response of laughter.

79,888747,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigurd%20Ring,Sigurd Ring,"Sigurd Ring (Old Norse: Sigurðr Hringr, in some sources merely called Hringr) was a legendary king of the Swedes mentioned in many old Scandinavian sagas. According to these sources he was granted rulership over Sweden as a vassal king under his uncle Harald Wartooth. Later he would take up arms against his uncle Harald in a bid to overthrow him and take the crown of Denmark, a conflict which Sigurd eventually won after the legendary Battle of the Brávellir, where it is said that Odin himself intervened and killed Harald. In the Sagas Sigurd is also known for being the father of the Norse Viking hero and legendary king of Denmark and Sweden, Ragnar Lodbrok. According to Bósa saga ok Herrauds, there was once a saga on Sigurd Ring, but this saga is now lost.

Hervarar saga
The Hervarar saga tells that when the Danish tributary king Valdar died, his son Randver became the king of Denmark, while his older brother Harald Wartooth took royal titles in Gautland. Then Harald subjugated all the territories once ruled by his maternal grandfather Ivar Vidfamne (Sweden, Denmark, Curonia, Saxony, Estonia, Gardarike, Northumberland). After Randver's death in battle in England, his son Sigurd Ring became the king of Denmark, presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd Ring and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir (Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd Ring ruled Denmark until his death and was succeeded by his son Ragnar Lodbrok. Harald Wartooth, however, had a son called Eysteinn Illruler who ruled Sweden until he was killed by Björn Ironside, a son of Ragnar Lodbrok.

Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum
In Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, Ring (mostly mentioned without the name element Sigurd) is the paternal nephew of the Danish king Harald Wartooth, and presumably (the part of Sögubrot where this would have been narrated expressly has not been preserved) the son of Randver, who in his turn is the son of Harald's mother Auðr the Deep-Minded and her husband king Raðbarðr of Gardariki. Harald Wartooth was beginning to feel old, so he made Ring the king of Uppland, with the commission to rule Sweden and Västergötland. When Harald reached the extraordinary age of 150, he desired to die like a king in battle, and therefore challenged Ring to meet him in the field. Ring gathered manpower from Sweden, Västergötland and Norway and marched his troops by land and sea to the plain of Brávellir beneath the forest of Kolmården, close to the Bråviken bay. There he was met by the multi-ethic army of Harald, and the colossal Battle of Brávellir followed. In the end Ring beat his uncle, who was bludgeoned to death in the desperate fighting, and became the ruler of Denmark as well. He put an jarl in charge of Skåne and made a shieldmaiden the ruler of the rest of Denmark (cf. Chronicon Lethrense, below).

Sigurd Ring (as he is now called in the text) married Alfhild, the daughter of King Gandalf Alfgeirsson of Alfheim (modern Bohuslän) and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. As Sigurd grew old, distant parts of his realm began to secede, and it is told how he lost territory in England due to old age. A certain Adalbrikt (Æthelberht) took possession of Northumbria and was succeeded by his sons Ama and Ælla. One day, Sigurd was in Västergötland and was visited by his in-laws, the sons of Gandalf. They asked him to join them in attacking king Eysteinn of Vestfold in Norway. In Vestfold, there were great blóts held at Skiringssal. Unfortunately, Sögubrot (meaning the ""fragment"") ends there. However, the Skjöldunga saga is believed to be the original story on which Sögubrot is based and it continues the story (see below).

Olaf Tryggvason's saga 
According to the extended Saga of Olaf Tryggvason, Sigurd Ring, after having stabilized his Swedish-Danish realm, recalled the lands in England once ruled by Harald Wartooth and Ivar Vidfamne. This territory was now ruled by Ingjald (Ingild), a brother of King Peter of Wessex and a mighty ruler in his own right. Ring therefore summoned the leiðangr and sailed to the west, reaching Northumbria. As Ingjald learned about the invasion, he gathered an army. In the ensuing battle, Ingjald and his son Ubbe (Eoppa) fell with a large part of their army. Ring now subordinated Northumbria and made Olaf Kinriksson tributary king. He was a grandnephew of Moald Digra, the mother of Ivar Vidfamne. Ring sailed back to his Nordic kingdom and Olaf reigned for a long time. Then, however, Eava (Eafa), the son of Ubbe, claimed the kingdom. Olaf was defeated and fled to his suzerain in Svíþióð. As compensation, Ring installed Olaf as sub-king in Jutland. As such he served Ring and later Ragnar Lodbrok. His descendants Grim, Audulf and Gorm (I) the Childless also ruled in Jutland. Gorm I adopted the foundling Knud, whose son Gorm II was the foster father of Hardeknud I, ancestor of the later Danish kings. The saga refers to names found in Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies, ancestors of Ecgberht, King of Wessex.

Ad catalogum regum Sveciæ annotanda (Skjöldunga saga)
The Skjöldunga saga tells that Sigurd Ring was married to Alfhild, the daughter of king Alf of Alfheim, and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. Unfortunately, Alfhild died. When Sigurd Ring was an old man, he came to Skiringssal to take part in the great blóts. There he spotted a very beautiful girl named Alfsol, and she was the daughter of King Alf of Vendel (Vendel). The girl's two brothers refused to allow Sigurd to marry her. Sigurd fought with the brothers and killed them, but their sister had been given poison by her brothers so that Sigurd could never have her. When her corpse was carried to Sigurd, he went aboard a large ship where he placed Alvsol and her brothers. Then, he steered the ship with full sails out on the sea, as the ship burnt.

Ragnar Lodbrok succeeded his father, but put a subking on the throne of Sweden, king Eysteinn Beli, who later was killed by Ragnar's sons.

Gesta Danorum
According to Gesta Danorum (book 7), by Saxo Grammaticus, Ring was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald and the maternal nephew of the Danish king Harald Wartooth. His father Ingjald had ravished the sister of Harald, resulting in an indecisive spate of warfare. In the end Harald accepted the abduction in order preserve the friendship with Ingjald. Ring fought with Harald Wartooth in the Battle of the Brávellir and became the overlord of Denmark as well. He appointed his cousin Ale the Strong as sub-king in Skåne while entrusting the shieldmaiden Hetha with the rest of the Danish lands. Saxo then describes the different subkings and their adventures. Fourteen Danish kings later, in book 9, Saxo presents a Sigurd Ring as Siwardus, surnamed Ring. This king, however, bears no resemblance to the victor of Brávellir. Rather, he is the son of a Norwegian chief Sigurd and the maternal grandson of the historical King Götrik (i.e. Gudfred, d. 810). Backed by the men of Zealand and Skåne, he fights a civil war against his cousin Ring. As the two rivals join battle, they both fall. Sigurd Ring is the father of Ragnar Lodbrok who has been brought up in Norway during the civil war, but is now hailed as Danish ruler.

Other sources
According to Hversu Noregr byggdist, Sigurd Ring is the son of Randver, the uterine brother of Harald Wartooth. Randver is the son of Raðbarðr while Harald is the son of Hrærekr slöngvanbaugi.

In the part of the Heimskringla called the Saga of Harald Fairhair, Harald Fairhair learns that the Swedish king Erik Eymundsson had enlarged Sweden westwards, until it reached the same extent as it had during king Sigurd Ring and his son Ragnar Lodbrok. This included Romerike, Westfold all the way to Grenmar, and Vingulmark.

In Ragnar Lodbrok's saga, it is mentioned that Sigurd Ring and Harald Wartooth fought in the Battle of the Brávellir and that Harald fell. After the battle Sigurd Ring was the king of Denmark, and he was the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.

Ragnarssona þáttr only states that Ring was the king of Sweden and Denmark, and the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.

In Bósa saga ok Herrauds, it is only said that Sigurd Ring, the father of Ragnar Lodbrok fought with Harald Wartooth at the Battle of the Brávellir where Harald died. It adds that there was a saga on Sigurd Ring (which today no longer exists).

According to the Chronicon Lethrense, Harald Wartooth had made all the countries down to the Mediterranean pay tribute. However, when he went to Sweden to demand tribute, the Swedish king Ring met him at the Battle of the Brávellir, and Harald lost and died. Ring made a shieldmaiden the ruler of Denmark (cf. Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, above).

Gríms saga loðinkinna and the younger version of Orvar-Odd's saga only mention Sigurd Ring in a few lines relating to the Battle of the Brávellir with Harald Wartooth.

In Norna-Gests þáttr, it is said that Sigurd Ring was very old when he sent his son-in-law, the son of Gandalf, to request the Gjukungs, Gunnar and Högne to pay tribute. This was promptly refused. The sons of Gandalf then asked Sigurd Ring to help them fight against the Gjukungs and their renowned ally Sigurd Fafnisbani. Sigurd Ring could not help them in person, as he was busy fighting against ravaging Curonians and Kœnir. Battle was joined in Holstein but turned into a defeat for the Norse army, since Sigurd Fanisbane made the Norse champion Starkad flee in panic.

Historical origins
It has been suggested that a report of a struggle for the Danish crown may have given rise to the legend of Sigurd Ring. Following the death of Hemming in 812, a civil war broke out between his brother or cousin Sigifridus and Anulo. This Anulo was the nephew or grandson (nepos) of an earlier king Harald. The rivals fought a battle for the succession in which both were killed. The names Sigfred and Sigurd were often conflated in medieval texts. As for Anulo, the name might originally represent Old Norse Ánleifr or Áli, though it was misunderstood by medieval Scandinavian chroniclers as Latin annulus which means ring.  Saxo Grammaticus and some other medieval compilers of king lists clearly combine the names Sigfred/Sigurd and Anulo/Ring into one person, having received knowledge of 9th century historical events from the chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075). Their historical successor Ragnfred (r. 812-813) is mixed up by Saxo with the Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok, who is identified as the son of Sigurd Ring. The Danish list of early Viking Age kings is therefore in part a High Medieval construction.

One possibility is thus that the struggle of 812 is reflected in the legendary Battle of the Brávellir, fought by Sigurd Ring, nephew of Harald Wartooth. Other scholars have suggested that the original name of the ruler was Ring, that he was a historical king of the Swedes, and that he won a battle against a Danish or East Geatic host in the 8th century. Still others regard the battle as mythical or purely legendary. Modern Swedish historians are skeptical to the prospects of establishing a chronology from the information of the High Medieval saga literature, and generally decline to discuss the possible historicity of Sigurd Ring or the Brávellir battle.

The name Ring occurs in the royal Swedish clan in the Viking Age, since the ecclesiastic chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075) says that a ruler in the first half of the 10th century bore that name.

The first primaries were held ahead of the 2010 general election. More than a dozen primaries were held ahead of the 2015 general election.

Selection committee
The members of the selection committee are as follows:

2010 general election
Primaries were held in a few seats, including Oxford West and Abingdon, Totnes, Gosport and Bracknell.

Totnes

Totnes was the first constituency to use an open primary to select the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate. The election was held in August 2009 and saw a turnout of approximately 25%. Due to the success of this primary election, David Cameron announced that the system would be applied to other constituencies in future. Dr Sarah Wollaston, a general practitioner, was selected with 48% of the vote. Wollaston went on to be elected MP for Totnes at the 2010 general election.

Bracknell 
The Bracknell primary was held in October 2009, and was won by Phillip Lee. Other candidates included Rory Stewart (elected as MP for Penrith and the Border in 2010) and broadcaster Iain Dale.

Gosport

Gosport held an open primary to select a candidate to succeed Peter Viggers upon his retirement from Westminster. The election was held in December 2009. Caroline Dinenage, a local business owner and daughter of Fred Dinenage, was selected with 38% of the vote. Dinenage was elected MP for Gosport at the 2010 general election, with an increased majority.

Clacton by-election, 2014

The 2014 Clacton by-election, caused by the defection from the Conservatives of Douglas Carswell, a prominent advocate of open primaries, selected actor Giles Watling over Colchester councillor Sue Lissimore on 11 September.

Rochester and Strood by-election, 2014

The candidate for the 2014 Rochester and Strood by-election, caused by the defection from the Conservative Party of Mark Reckless to the UK Independence Party (UKIP), was chosen by a postal open primary. Kelly Tolhurst, a local councillor, narrowly won over fellow councillor Anna Firth. Tolhurst lost the by-election to Reckless, but later won the seat at the following year's general election.

91,39362848,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External%20inhibition,External inhibition,"External inhibition is the observed decrease of the response of a conditioned reaction when an external (distracting) stimulus that was not part of the original conditioned response set is introduced. This effect was first observed in Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning studies where the dogs would salivate less (conditioned response) when presented with the sound of the tuning fork (conditioned stimulus) in the distracting context of a passing truck (external stimulus). External inhibition is important for its main principle in classical conditioning where a conditioned response may decrease in magnitude after the external stimulus is introduced. This is especially advantageous for when trying to disassociate conditioned stimulus and responses. A practical example is where students who become anxious (conditioned response) upon standing in front of the class to give a presentation (conditioned stimulus) may feel less anxiety if their friends were sitting in front of the student presenting (external stimulus). The positive association of speaking to friends may distract the student from associating speaking to the entire class with anxiety.

Extent of external inhibition
The extent of external inhibition depends on several factors, including:
The intensity of the external stimulus – the stronger the external stimulus, the greater the inhibition of the conditioned response.
The amount of time it takes to notice the external stimulus – the shorter the time it takes for the subject to perceive the external stimulus, the stronger the effect will be on disrupting the conditioned response. 
Strict control of the learning environment – the presence of a distracting stimulus will lead to greater external inhibition when learning has occurred under tightly controlled conditions than when learning conditions are more variable.

External inhibition in relation to disinhibition
This same external stimulus can also lead to an increased response of a conditioned reaction, called disinhibition, when introduced after experimental extinction (when the conditioned response process is independent of the conditioned stimulus). During extinction, the subject has been unconditioned as to not show the conditioned response when presented by the paired conditioned stimulus. An example of disinhibition is where a rat that was conditioned to walk from point A to point B at the sound of the buzzer and then unconditioned, and introduced with a different stimulus, such as a blinking light, will again exhibit the conditioned reaction of walking to point B. The observed response of walking to point B after a blinking light stimulus will be relatively greater compared to the rat’s movement during the unconditioned phase (when the rat was not presented with either the buzzer or blinking light).

Experimental studies

""External Inhibition and Disinhibition Produced by Duplicate Stimuli"", Wenger (1936)
Wenger's 1936 study examined if the same external stimulus can be used to demonstrate both external inhibition and disinhibition and the relationship of the external stimulus to the intensity of external inhibition and disinhibition. Wenger conditioned participants with electro-dermal response (raising the foot to avoid the shock) to a red light using repeating presentations of a red light paired with a shock to the right foot. After the participants were conditioned, the extra stimulus of a tactual vibration to the left hand was introduced before the red light was shown in the absence of a shock stimulus. Following the principles of external inhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the after-effect of the tactual vibration would inhibit the conditioned response to the red light and lead to smaller movements of the foot to the red light.
Disinhibition was tested after experimental extinction, where the red light was presented multiple times without any shock reinforcement. Following the principles of disinhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the tactual vibration will induce a greater reaction to the light stimuli when compared to the reactions from the external inhibition test. 
Both of Wenger's hypotheses were confirmed; Wenger observed that both external inhibition and disinhibition could be produced by the same external stimulus (tactual vibration). In addition, higher intensity of the external stimulus produced greater magnitudes of external inhibition and disinhibition however the functional strengths of externally inhibited and disinhibited responses were not considered decisive.

""External Inhibition and Disinhibition in a Conditioned Operant Response"", Gagne (1941)
The 1941 study by Gagné attempted to identify the effect of two different external stimuli (buzzer, and scratching on the back of the starting box) on rats, while applied during acquisition and extinction, to identify the effect on the strength of the conditioned operant response. Five groups of rats were used, however the differences in the latent period were hypothesized to be observed in the following conditions if it existed in comparison to a control group that did not introduce any external stimuli, 1) buzzer on the first trial of acquisition, 2) scratch on the first trial of acquisition, 3) buzzer on the fourth trial of acquisition, 4) scratch on the fourth trial of acquisition, 5) buzzer on the fifth trial of extinction, and 6) scratch on the fifth trial of extinction.  For each experimental procedure, the buzzer was sounded for four seconds and stopped for two seconds before the beginning of the next trial; the scratching continued until the rat turned around to face the back of the starting box. 
The buzzer can be interpreted to explain Pavlov's observations on external inhibition and disinhibition in a conditioned operant response and support B. F. Skinner's hypothesis of an ""emotional effect"".  Skinner describes that an emotional effect is observed when a response fails to be reinforced, possibly leading to operant extinction, and also an emotional ""reaction commonly spoken of as frustration or rage"".  Regarding the extra stimulus used, the buzzer has a ""depressing effect"" on all trials which decreased the response magnitude during extinction. An observed increase of response magnitude following the depression would be considered a ""compensatory increase in the number of available responses"". On the other hand, the buzzer can also be interpreted as an external stimulus that decreases the response magnitude (external inhibition), and produce an increased response magnitude on the next trial (disinhibition) after the effect of inhibition declines. This suggests that the buzzer weakens the conditioned response, but if it is repeatedly encountered, it serves to strengthen the conditioned response, thereby decreasing the latent period.
The external scratching stimulus portrays external inhibition during acquisition (fourth trial of acquisition), and disinhibition during extinction (fifth trial of extinction). There was a significant increase in the recorded latent period (i.e., the time it took for the rat to move out of the starting box and pass a four-inch mark while walking towards the food box), and decline in the magnitude of the conditioned response since the rat took longer to reach the four inch point. The additional learned response of the rat turning to the front of the box in reaction to the scratching is an effect of external inhibition, which may have added to the latent time, but the results do not indicate what portion of the rat’s turn-around response made up the latent time. Shortened latent period on the fifth trial of extinction indicates an increased magnitude of response, and represents disinhibition, where the rat is not responding to the extra stimulus as much and increases the magnitude of the conditioned response (faster latent time).

""Experimental Inhibition of the Conditioned Eyelid Reflex"", Pennypacker (1964)
In a study by Pennypacker (1964), a conditioned stimulus of a circular red light, an unconditioned stimulus of a puff of dry compressed air, and an external stimulus of a 1,000-cps tone were used to investigate external inhibition at the human level during different introduction intervals. Reflexive blinking was measured as the conditioned and unconditioned response.  Each participant was first presented with two trials of the circular red light without reinforcement, and three trials of the puff of dry compressed air alone. Depending on the group, participants were presented with either 15, 30, or 60 paired conditioned stimulus – unconditioned stimulus (CS-UCS) trials, a round of an external stimulus, another 15, 30, or 60 trials of CS-UCS trials, another round of an external stimulus, and then 5 CS-UCS trials. 
Pennypacker suggested that following the introduction of any novel stimuli, a period of excitation occurs between the conditioned stimulus (red light) and its conditioned response (blinking), called an induction period. Thus, if the external stimulus was presented earlier in the acquisition phase, the observed decline in blinking would be even less than if the external stimulus was presented later. Pennypacker also suggested that it may be possible that an external stimulus that was introduced too late to affect the conditioned stimulus may externally inhibit the unconditioned stimulus. However, the study failed to confirm the presence of induction immediately after the tone (external stimulus) was introduced, and there was no evidence that external stimulus had any effect on reflexive blinking when presented halfway through the interval, aside from isolated cases. He suggests that the difference between the induction effect observed in a preliminary study and the current study are due to the use of visual external stimulus during a preliminary study and presenting the external stimulus instead of the conditioned stimulus; compared to the use of an auditory external stimulus and presentation of the tone in addition to the conditioned stimulus. Another suggestion is that the external stimulus was not intense enough to produce an inductive effect. 
Through this study, Pennypacker confirmed the observation of external inhibition on the human level. External inhibition was especially observed when the tone (external stimulus) was introduced during the acquisition phase, which was the interval right after the paired CS-UCS trials. The conditioned response, blinking reflex, was observed to be in decline (inhibited) compared to the rate during conditioning.

96,5185460,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio%20Barzini,Emilio Barzini,"Emilio ""The Wolf"" Barzini is a fictional character and the main antagonist in Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather and in its 1972 film adaptation, in which he is portrayed by Richard Conte. The Barzini crime family was inspired by the Genovese crime family.

In the novel
Barzini heads one of New York's Five Families, and is the second most powerful Mafia don in the country after Vito Corleone. His criminal interests are in narcotics, gambling, and prostitution, and he is looking to expand his empire to Las Vegas to take advantage of the Mafia's lucrative casino rackets.

Don Barzini first appears as a guest at Connie Corleone's wedding. Soon after, he arranges for his associate, drug lord Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, to meet Don Vito Corleone with an offer to join the Barzini and Tattaglia families in the narcotics trade; Sollozzo in particular is hoping to gain access to Vito's political connections. During the meeting, Sonny, the family underboss, expresses interest in the deal, but Vito refuses the offer as he finds narcotics too much of a ""dirty business"". Barzini then approves Sollozzo's plan to have Vito murdered in the hopes that Sonny, as his father's successor, will accept the deal. When Sonny refuses to enter the heroin trade after his father survives the attempt on his life, Barzini secretly conspires with the Tattaglia, Cuneo, and Stracci families to wage war on the Corleones, forcing them to make peace and open up their territory to drug trafficking. To this end, he conspires with Vito's bitter son-in-law, Carlo Rizzi, to draw Sonny into a trap where he is assassinated by Barzini family hitmen while driving to his sister's house. After Sonny's death, Don Corleone agrees to lend his political protection to the enterprise and forgive the other families for having his son killed. Although it initially appears that Don Philip Tattaglia is responsible for organizing the anti-Corleone alliance, Vito soon realizes that Barzini is the true mastermind.

Not satisfied with the Corleones' submission, Barzini begins a larger plan to absorb their territory into his own by chipping away at Corleone rackets. At Don Corleone's funeral, Barzini has his mole in the Corleone family, caporegime Salvatore Tessio, approach Vito's successor, Michael Corleone, with a request for a meeting, intending to assassinate him and break up the family. What Barzini doesn't know, however, is that Michael is aware of his plans. Before he died, the elder Corleone had explicitly warned his son that the family's enemies would attempt to kill him in exactly this manner — at a supposed peace meeting — with whoever approached him with the proposal unintentionally exposing themselves as a traitor. Michael has been planning for some time to eliminate Barzini and the other Dons, and deliberately allowed Barzini to weaken his family in order to lull him into complacency. Shortly thereafter, Barzini is assassinated along with the other conspirators. Corleone enforcer Al Neri, disguised as a police officer, lies in wait for the Don outside of the New York Supreme Court building at Foley Square on the pretext of writing a parking ticket for Barzini's car. When Barzini emerges from the building, Neri guns down his bodyguard and driver, and shoots the fleeing Barzini twice in the back, letting his corpse tumble down the stairs as he jumps into a getaway car.

Influences
Emilio Barzini is based on several real-life mobsters. His desire to take complete control of the New York Mafia is inspired by Vito Genovese, who made a similar attempt in the 1950s that ended with the disastrous Apalachin meeting. Barzini's mannerisms and management skills, as well as his skillful machinations and influence over the Five Families, are inspired by Frank Costello and Lucky Luciano; all three men served as bosses of the Genovese crime family.

In other media
In Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptation of The Godfather, Barzini is portrayed by Richard Conte. Conte was previously considered for the role of Don Vito Corleone, but lost to Marlon Brando.

In The Godfather: The Game, Barzini's role is expanded. In the 1930s, he personally oversees an ambush that results in the brutal public murder of Aldo Trapani's father, a rising caporegime in the Corleone family. Because of this, his son Aldo swears to one day take revenge on the Don. In the game, Aldo, rather than Al Neri, is the assassin who shoots Barzini dead on the courthouse steps.

100,561179,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal%20codes%20in%20Switzerland%20and%20Liechtenstein,Postal codes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein,"On 26 June 1964, Swiss Post introduced postal codes as the third country after Germany (1941) and the United States (1963).

In Switzerland, the postal codes have four digits. As with the postcode system introduced in Germany in 1993, a municipality can receive several postcodes. A locality (settlement) having its own postal code does not mean that it is an independent political municipality, but only that it is an official locality. In addition, a postcode can include several political communes (e.g.: 3048 Worblaufen, includes parts of the communes of Bern and Ittigen) or several cantons (e.g.: 8866 Ziegelbrücke, includes parts of the cantons of Glarus and St. Gallen), which is why it is not possible to assign it unambiguously in both directions. In addition, it is often not possible to assign a unique postcode to post offices (post boxes) in larger cities. For this reason, six-digit postcodes are used internally.

The Principality of Liechtenstein is also included in the Swiss postal code system, as is the German enclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein, which has its own Swiss postal codes in addition to its national one, D-78266. Before January 2020, the Italian enclave of Campione d'Italia also had a Swiss postcode, CH-6911, but this ceased to be valid, and all mail requires the use of the Italian postcode. This followed the enclave's entry into the European Union's Customs Area. Also in Italy, Swiss Post previously held an office in Domodossola with the code CH-3907. This is now used for the village of Simplon.

Format of postal codes (PLZ/NPA)
The Swiss postal codes are assigned geographically, from west to east. They don't follow political divisions (cantons, districts), but they follow a routing allocation, following railways and PostBus routes. The postal code of big cities finish with 00, and it is not allocated if in the region there isn't a big center.

Switzerland is divided into nine postal districts, numbered from west to east. Each district is subdivided into postal areas.
Each area contains a maximum of one hundred units.

The postal codes are made up as follows:
3436 Zollbrück
3 = district (Bern)
34 = area (Burgdorf)
343 = route (Burgdorf - Langnau)
3436 = post office number (Zollbrück)

Today, the third digit has no real meaning anymore. In the past, mail was assigned to fixed railway or truck routes, but modern logistics do not need this practice any more.

Postal codes of Liechtenstein are included in the same structure, using the range from 9480 to 9499.

103,24013523,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin%20Cinemas,Merlin Cinemas,"Merlin Cinemas are a British cinema chain with Head Office based in England. they were formed in 1990 and predominantly operate in small coastal towns.  In many cases, the cinemas operated were saved from closure and run on very small margins, but they are supported by some of the larger ones in the group that have been extensively refurbished and modernised to include luxury screens with waiter service, plus licensed bars, restaurants and live theatre.

Mainly, Merlin Cinemas operate in traditional cinema buildings rather than new builds.  They operate the most Southerly cinema in the UK mainland at Penzance, and the most Northerly in Thurso.

Locations
They operate cinemas in:

Regal Cinema, Redruth

Merlin Cinemas' flagship venue is Regal  in Redruth, Cornwall, England, in the United Kingdom. The cinema opened on 2 December 1935, with seating for 982 on a semi-stadium plan. It was opened by Mr Prance as part of Sound & Movement Cinemas. The original sound system was by British Thomson-Houston. In the 1960s the cinema was equipped with CinemaScope and stereophonic sound.

When the Cornwall Circuit Group of cinemas were taken over by The Rank Group, the cinema was later sold off to independent Vivian Bartle, and in 1983 the former café area was converted into an 80-seat screen 2. The auditorium was tripled in 1986 with seating for 600 front area (screen 3) and 172 (screen 2) & 121 (Screen 1) in the rear areas. It was taken over by Merlin Cinemas on 24 July 1998.

In August 2008 the exterior of the building was fully refurbished, including a new roof, with walls re-rendered and painted in blue with red stripes ( Merlin Cinemas, colour scheme).

April 2011 saw another phase of redevelopment at the Regal with two screens going digital, screen 7 (a licensed auditorium with leather arm chairs) and screen 3 boasting Dolby 3D.

During 2012–13 the main auditorium, already the largest screen and auditorium in Cornwall, was subject to a £1.5 million transformation. Capacity increased to 650 and includes circle, stalls and box seats. To increase the number of screens from 4 to 6 the auditorium was partitioned, and two screens were placed underneath the circle. This was in addition to other work taken out on the other screens. All six screens were officially opened on 21 July 2013. All 6 screens are licensed for alcohol consumption.

Building
The exterior is a fine 1930s art deco design complete with tower and cinema name placed between horizontal strips. It was completely refurbished with new neon signage and outdoor under-pavement blue LED lighting during October and November 2007. The windows have been blocked in for the screen in the former café but the whole façade is still striking. Above the main entrance is Screen 7, which opened in 2006. This is accessed by a circular staircase from the bar and restaurant next door, and not through the main cinema entrance. In addition, Screen 7 is also unusual in having a licence, waiter service and double, sofa style, seating and tables.

In the main foyer, which is circular in shape, the low ceiling commands you to observe the art deco design at the centre of the floor.

The plans were drawn up by an Australian architect called Mr Smith working for the Watkins Partnership in  Bristol. The most striking feature is the fin structure (to the left of the frontage) that spreads upwards into the air above the cinema. The size of this fin runs about 23 feet into the building, (about the depth of the foyer). Originally, there was a glass lit central feature rising the full height and according to the plan had the words ""cinema & café"" detailed into it. This feature today has been boxed over.
Inside, the foyer executes a visual trick. The auditorium is set at a different angle to the façade by roughly 25 degrees. By creating a circular foyer the architect has disguised this fact, as without obvious side and back walls the patrons were unlikely to notice the change in direction. From the foyer were doors to a small lounge (off to the left - originally they had gold coloured rattan chairs and glass topped rattan tables) and stairs to the café, above the foyer. Light gained entry to the café by the large windows running across the frontage, the kitchen was placed under the large fin structure with a single window beyond the fin.

From the foyer are steps down to the vestibule, where a cloakroom and toilets were available before entering the fan shaped auditorium. There was a front stalls entrance and foyer set to the left of the stage. The stage had an orchestra pit and 35' wide proscenium. The projection box was placed above the raised area of seating.  It has also been reported that a colour lit fountain was contained in the building, probably within the café. The walls of the cafe had drawings of deer and a young couple skating. The auditorium is quite plain with leaves painted on the side walls.

104,15958785,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia%20Cahill%20%28drug%20smuggler%29,Patricia Cahill (drug smuggler),"Patricia Cahill was arrested in July 1990 for attempting to smuggle 32 kg of heroin from Thailand to Amsterdam.

Due to her  Cahill could not be executed, which was the maximum sentence available under Thai law. At her trial in December 1990, she was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Her case caused high-profile media coverage. Cahill was released from prison within three years after pressure from the British authorities.

Arrest
Cahill and her friend Karyn Smith went to Thailand for a holiday, after a British man offered to pay their way. Her parents were not aware that she had left the country, and believed her to be in Scotland. At Bangkok International Airport their baggage was searched, and the drugs discovered. The quantity of heroin seized was at the time, the largest in any haul ever. Throughout their trial, they maintained that the drugs had been planted on them, and that they had no knowledge that they were carrying anything illicit.  However, in a later interview from prison, Smith confessed that she knew she was carrying something but she had no idea what exactly it was. ""It could have been gold or ammunition. I did not know anything about drugs at that time."".

Subsequent release
Despite accepting the verdict and sentence of the Thai courts, the government of Britain went to unusual measures to secure the release of Patricia Cahill, who, at the time of her offence was a minor.

The British embassy in Bangkok submitted a petition for a pardon from the King of Thailand to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The embassy supported the petition on the grounds of Miss Cahill's  at the time the offence was committed.

106,17385727,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal%20Revenue%20Code%20section%20409A,Internal Revenue Code section 409A,"Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code regulates nonqualified deferred compensation  paid by a ""service recipient"" to a ""service provider"" by generally imposing a 20% excise tax when certain design or operational rules contained in the section are violated.    Service recipients are generally employers, but those who hire independent contractors are also service recipients. Service providers include executives, general employees, some independent contractors and board members, as well as entities that provide services (an LLC, for example, could be a service provider).

History
Section 409A was added to the Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1, 2005, under Section 885 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The effects of Section 409A are far-reaching, because of the exceptionally broad definition of ""deferral of compensation."" Section 409A was enacted, in part, in response to the practice of Enron executives accelerating the payments under their deferred compensation plans in order to access the money before the company went bankrupt, and also in part in response to a history of perceived tax-timing abuse due to limited enforcement of the constructive receipt tax doctrine.

Basic summary
Section 409A generally provides that ""non-qualified deferred compensation"" must comply with various rules regarding the timing of deferrals and distributions. Under regulations issued by the IRS, Section 409A applies whenever there is a ""deferral of compensation,"" which occurs whenever an employee has a legally binding right during a taxable year to compensation that is or may be payable in a later taxable year. There are various exceptions, excluding from the Section 409A rules compensation that would otherwise fall within this definition, including: qualified plans like the pension and 401(k) plans, and welfare benefits including vacation leave, sick leave, disability pay, or death benefit plan. Other exceptions include those for ""short-term deferrals"" (i.e. payments made within 2.5 months of the year in which the deferred compensation is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture), certain stock option and stock appreciation rights and certain separation pay plans.

Qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation
Section 409A makes a distinction between deferred compensation plans and deferral of compensation. The term ""plan"" includes any agreement, method, program, or other arrangement, including an agreement, method, program, or other arrangement that applies to one person or individual.

Section 409A specifies that unless any deferred compensation falls into a specified set of ""qualified deferred compensation"" categories, the IRS will automatically consider it unqualified deferred compensation. The qualified deferred compensation categories are:
 Qualified employer plans (these are basically employer retirement plans)
 Certain foreign plans
 Section 457 plans
 Certain welfare benefits
 Stock options

Timing restrictions
Section 409A's timing restrictions fall into three main categories:

 restrictions on the timing of distributions
 restrictions against the acceleration of benefits
 restrictions on the timing of deferral elections

Distributions under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan can only be payable upon one of six circumstances:

 the employee's separation from service
 the employee's becoming disabled
 the employee's death
 a fixed time or schedule specified under the plan
 a change in ownership or effective control of the corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation
 the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency

In addition, Section 409A provides that with respect to certain ""key employees"" of publicly traded corporations, distributions upon separation from service must be delayed by an additional six months following separation (or death, if earlier). Key employees are generally the top 50 employees with pay above $150,000.

The rules restricting the timing of elections as to the time or form of payment under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan fall into two categories:

 initial deferral elections
 subsequent deferral elections
As a general rule, initial deferral elections must be made no later than the close of the employee's taxable year immediately preceding the service year. The term ""initial deferral elections"" includes all decisions, whether made by the employee or employer, as to the time or form of payment under the plan. Once the initial deferral election is made, a change to the time or form of payment under the plan can only be made under the rules governing subsequent deferral elections.

Penalties
Section 409A assigns compliance-failure penalties to the recipient of deferred compensation (the ""service provider"") and not to the company offering the compensation (the ""service recipient""). The sanctions for non-compliance can be severe. The specific penalties written into law are:
 all compensation deferred for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years becomes includible in gross income for the taxable year to the extent the compensation is not subject to a ""substantial risk of forfeiture"" and has not previously been included in gross income
 accrued interest on the taxable amount
 an additional penalty of 20% of the deferred compensation which is required to be included in gross income

Impact on privately-held companies
One area of concern in early drafts of 409A was the impact on companies with stock that is not readily tradeable on an established securities market and these companies' employees. As of 2014, approximately 8.5 million American workers held stock options. Since options often vest and become taxable more than 1 year after they are granted, it would seem that 409A would apply to this as a form of deferred compensation. However, 409A specifically does not apply to incentive stock options (ISOs) and non-qualified stock options (NSOs) granted at fair market value. However, if a company issues options to a service provider at a valuation below fair market value, section 409A will apply. The fair market value of an option on common stock is defined as the fair market value of the common stock (the underlying security) on the date of issuance. Therefore, the valuation of common stock is critical.

Anticipating this problem, those drafting the regulations created a set of valuation standards for companies. The code provided a way for companies to achieve a safe-harbor valuation. A safe-harbor valuation is one where the IRS must accept the valuation as valid unless the IRS can demonstrate that the valuation is ""grossly unreasonable"". The code provides three possible ways for companies to achieve a safe-harbor valuation of their common stock:
 Securing an independent appraisal
 Using a generally applicable repurchase formula
 In the case of an illiquid startup, securing a valuation by a qualified individual or individuals applied at a time that the corporation did not otherwise anticipate a change in control event or public offering of the stock

The code defines ""illiquid stock of a startup corporation"" as stock of a corporation that meets the following criteria:
 the corporation is less than 10 years old
 the corporation has no class of equity security that is publicly traded
 the stock granted is not subject to a put, call or similar derivative
 neither the company nor the stock recipient could reasonably anticipate that the company would be acquired within 90 days or go public within 180 days

Industry commentators pushed for specific guidelines regarding the definition of a ""qualified individual"" who could perform the valuation for an illiquid startup. The final regulations did not provide specific examples of the qualifications necessary to perform a 409A valuation for an illiquid startup, highlighting that the requisite experience ""could be obtained in many ways"". However, the final regulations clarified that: 
 the standard to be applied is whether it would be reasonable to rely on the advice of the person performing the valuation in deciding whether to accept an offer to purchase or sell the stock being valued and
 having the requisite experience generally means having at least five years of relevant experience in business valuation or appraisal, financial accounting, investment banking, private equity, secured lending, or other comparable experience

Given the small budgets of illiquid startups, many industry participants (including companies and their investors) became frustrated by the need to pay for potentially costly valuations by independent valuation firms. Some valuations could initially cost $50,000, a sum that most startups could never pay. However, recent 409A valuation prices for startup companies have decreased to $1,500–5,000 range, depending on the stage of the company receiving the valuation. For pre-IPO companies and very late-stage companies the prices can be significantly higher as the need for more frequent valuations increases.

Criticisms of IRC 409A
Industry commentators have had ongoing concerns with Section 409A. From its announcement and finalization, the IRS itself has recognized that many industry commentators have expressed concerns about the complexity and reasonableness of several aspects of the law. Particular criticisms have included:

 409A adds complexity and cost to some business transactions that do not even create tax advantages
 409A's scope is too broad and captures non-tax-motivated transactions
 Its technical complexity can be a trap to the unaware or unsophisticated
 Its complexity may also limit the ability for people to engage in legitimate deferred compensation transactions

108,20033659,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93South%20cooperation,South–South cooperation,"South–South cooperation is a term historically used by policymakers and academics to describe the exchange of resources, technology, and knowledge between developing countries, also known as countries of the Global South. The Global South is making increasingly significant contributions to global development. The economic and geopolitical relevance of many countries has grown. In the past, south-south cooperation focused on sharing knowledge and building capacities, but the countries of the Global South and new financial institutions have recently also become increasingly active in development finance.

History
The formation of SSC can be traced to the Asian–African Conference that took place in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955 which is also known as the Bandung Conference. The conference has been largely regarded as a milestone for SSC cooperation. Indonesia's president at that time, Sukarno, referred to it as ""the first intercontinental conference of coloured peoples in the history of mankind."" Despite Sukarno's opening address about the conference, there had been gatherings similar to the Bandung conference in the past. Nevertheless the Bandung Conference was distinctive and facilitated the formation of SSC because it was the first time that the countries in attendance were no longer colonies of distant European powers. President Sukarno also famously remarked at the conference that ""Now we are free, sovereign, and independent. We are again masters in our own house. We do not need to go to other continents to confer.""

The conference was sponsored by India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, and Indonesia and was attended by these 29 independent countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gold Coast, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, State of Vietnam, and the Kingdom of Yemen. Each country supported the continuation of decolonization efforts happening in both Africa and Asia at the time. Although many countries disagreed on some issues, the Bandung Conference ""provided the first major instance of the post-colonial countries' collective resistance to Western Dominance in International relations.""

In 1978, the United Nations established the Unit for South–South Cooperation to promote South–South trade and collaboration within its agencies.

However, the idea of South–South cooperation only started to influence the field of development in the late 1990s. Due to the geographical spectrum, activities are known as South America-Africa (ASA) cooperation as well as, in the Asia-Pacific region, South–South cooperation.

The ASA cooperation has so far held two summits. The first summit was held in Abuja, Nigeria, in 2006 where 53 delegates from Africa and 12 from South America attended. The second and most recent one was held on the Margarita Island in Venezuela in Sept 2009 where 49 heads of states from Africa and 12 heads of states from South America attended.

South–South cooperation has been successful in decreasing dependence on the aid programs of developed countries and in creating a shift in the international balance of power.

Direction
The Leaders of South American and African countries hope that this cooperation will bring a new world order and counter the existing Western dominance socially, economically and politically. Late president Hugo Chávez saw the formation of this cooperation as the ""beginning of the salvation of [the] people,"" and as a major anti-imperialism movement. Like President Hugo Chávez, the ex-Libyan Leader Muammar al-Gaddafi was also very critical of the Western dominance of the ""third world"" nations.

Economic alliance

One of the key goals of the cooperation is to strengthen and improve economic ties. Some of the areas which these ""southern"" nations look forward to improving further include joint investment in energy and oil, and a common bank. Among other regional trade agreements which were reached during the 2009 summit was Venezuela signing an oil agreement with South Africa and a memorandum of understanding with Sierra Leone to form a joint mining company. Meanwhile, Brazil has developed an increasingly successful model of overseas aid provision of over $1 billion annually (ahead of many traditional donors), which focuses on technical expertise and the transfer of knowledge and expertise. Most of Brazilian aid is allocated to Africa, specifically to Portuguese-speaking African countries, and Latin America. Brazil's form of South–South development aid has been called a 'global model in waiting'.

The two continents have over one quarter of the world's energy resources. This includes the oil and natural gas reserves in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, Algeria, Angola, Libya, Nigeria, Chad, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.

In recent years, the South–South cooperation has recognized the importance of effective financial inclusion policy in order to better deliver appropriate financial services to the poor. Because of this, financial policy makers from nearly 100 developing and emerging countries now comprise a global knowledge-sharing network called the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI).

Representatives from the developing south meet annually at the Global Policy Forum (GPF), making it the most important and comprehensive forum for regulatory institutions from emerging economies with an interest in promoting financial inclusion policy. The forum is focused on developing and improving national financial inclusion strategies and policies, and is used as a platform for senior financial regulators to exchange ideas and engage in peer-to-peer learning activities.

Banks to finance infrastructure projects 
One challenge for South–South cooperation has been the lack of sufficient capital to start a South–South bank as an alternative to the IMF and the World Bank. This has changed with the launch of two new 'South–South banks'.
At the sixth summit of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa), in July 2014, the five partners approved the establishment of the New Development Bank (or BRICS Development Bank), with a primary focus on lending for infrastructure projects. It will be based in Shanghai. A Contingency Reserve Agreement (CRA) has been concluded in parallel to provide the BRICS countries with alternatives to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in times of economic hardship, protect their national economies and strengthen their global position. The Russian Federation is contributing US$18 billion to the CRA, which will be credited by the five partners with a total of over US$100 billion. The CRA is now operational. In 2015 and 2016, work was under way to develop financing mechanisms for innovative projects with the new bank’s resources.

The second new bank is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It has also been set up to finance infrastructure projects. Spearheaded by China, the bank is based in Beijing. By 2016, more than 50 countries had expressed interest in joining, including a number of developed countries: France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, etc.

Asia–Pacific Free Trade Area 
China is spearheading the creation of an Asia–Pacific Free Trade Area, which, according to China’s vision, would override existing bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements in the region. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2014 endorsed the Beijing Roadmap for completing a feasibility study by late 2016.

South-South cooperation in science

Role of regional economic communities 
Countries of the South are developing cooperation through regional economic communities. For example, the Russian Federation is developing co-operation with Asian partners within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Eurasian Economic Union. The latter was launched on 1 January 2015 with Belarus and Kazakhstan and has since been extended to Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The Eurasian Economic Union replaces the Eurasian Economic Community.  In July 2015, the Russian Federation hosted a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in the same city, at which the admission of India and Pakistan was announced.

Regional economic communities have become a conduit for South–South cooperation in science, technology and innovation. For example, Iran’s Nanotechnology Initiative Council established an Econano network in 2008 to promote the scientific and industrial development of nanotechnology among fellow members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

Bilateral collaboration 
Countries are also co-operating in science, technology and innovation on a bilateral basis to develop infrastructure and diversify the economy.  There is ‘dynamic bilateral collaboration’ between China and the Russian Federation, for instance. This cooperation stems from the Treaty on Good Neighbourliness, Friendship and Co-operation signed by the two countries in 2001, which has given rise to regular four-year plans for its implementation. Dozens of joint large-scale projects are being carried out. They concern the construction of the first super-high-voltage electricity transmission line in China; the development of an experimental fast neutron reactor; geological prospecting in the Russian Federation and China; and joint research in optics, metal processing, hydraulics, aerodynamics and solid fuel cells. Other priority areas for co-operation include industrial and medical lasers, computer technology, energy, the environment and chemistry, geochemistry, catalytic processes and new materials.

Role of regional centres
Increasingly, countries of the South are fostering cooperation in science and technology through regional or international centres. Africa has considerably expanded its networks of centres of excellence since the turn of the century. Most of these networks focus on biosciences but there is also a network in the field of mathematical sciences. Examples are the Bio-Innovate network based in Kenya, which focuses on improving agricultural techniques and developing agro-processing, and the African Biosafety Network of Expertise based in Burkina Faso, which helps regulators deal with safety issues related to the introduction and development of genetically modified organisms. These networks have an Achilles tendon, in that they tend to be reliant on donor funding for their survival.

Many regional and international centres have been set up under the auspices of United Nations agencies. One example is the International Science, Technology and Innovation Centre for South–South Cooperation (ISTIC) in Malaysia. It was established in 2008 under the auspices of UNESCO. In 2014, the Caribbean network of scientists, Cariscience, ran a training workshop in Tobago on Technopreneurship for the Caribbean, in partnership with ISTIC. Another example is a centre which uses Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East (SESAME). Most of the eight members of SESAME are developing economies: Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey. The SESAME centre is being officially inaugurated in May 2017. Iran hosts several international research centres, including the following, which function under the auspices of United Nations bodies: the Regional Centre for Science Park and Technology Incubator Development (UNESCO, est. 2010), the International Centre on Nanotechnology (UNIDO, est. 2012) and the Regional Educational and Research Centre for Oceanography for Western Asia (UNESCO, est. 2014).

Security alliance
Peace and security responsibilities are also on the top of the agenda for cooperation. During the 2009 Africa-South America Summit, Colonel Gaddafi proposed a defence alliance between South America and Africa. He called the alliance ""a Nato of the South.""  This type of alliance aims to act as an alternative to the Security Council none of whose permanent members is from the two continents.

Political unity
Another area that some of the leaders intend to see big developments in is in the political arena. This is to say that cooperation will give the continents more political power when it comes to the global arena. Some leaders hope that the cooperation will offer greater freedom in choosing a political system. For example, Hugo Chávez hoped to use South–South cooperation as a stage on which to get his message of what he called ""21st Century Socialism"" across.

Critique
The most apparent critique is that there are just a few voices being heard. These voices are often from the comparatively rich and powerful states of the south (e.g. Brazil, India, South Africa and Venezuela).

113,3261618,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout%20Association%20of%20Nigeria,Scout Association of Nigeria,"The Scout Association of Nigeria (SAN) is the national Scouting organization of Nigeria. Scouting was founded in the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1915 and became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1961. SAN has about 750,210 members as of 2015.

History
Scouting was brought to Nigeria by British Governor-General of Nigeria, Lord Frederick Lugard on 21 November 1915, and Scout groups were created for the dependents of British citizens living in the British Protectorates. Shortly after, local boys were permitted to be Scouts.

Nigeria gained its independence in 1960 and the Scout movement immediately grew as the Scouting program was heavily promoted. Shortly after independence, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe became the Chief Scout of Nigeria. In 1961, the Boy Scout Association of Nigeria was registered at the International Scout Bureau in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as a National Scout Organization. General Yakubu Gowon became the Chief Scout of Nigeria from 1966 to 1975.

C.C. Mojekwu served on the World Scout Committee of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1961 until 1969.

In 1979, F.O. Ogunlana was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.

Many Nigerian Scouts served internationally as a trainer or volunteer. Some won international awards and also manage unit or groups in the UK and USA. BSA archive have:- Gabriel Ofotokun-Goodwill: Nigeria and BSA in 1969 -85.Soneye Plip: Nigeria, BSA and UK scouts trainer and commissioner in 2004 - Been the most populated African nation and most populous black nation, scouting is increasing on daily basis in Nigeria.

In 1999 at the World Scout Conference in Durban, South Africa, Resolution 4/99 was adopted by the Conference on Gender Balance in Scouting, urging all National Scout Organizations to adopt gender balance programs. The Annual General Meeting of the Boy Scout Association of Nigeria was held later that year, the NSO name was changed to the gender-neutral Scout Association of Nigeria.

Program

Activities
This organization is open to both boys and girls of all religions, although its members are mostly Muslims and Christians of various denominations.

Program emphasis is on citizenship training and community service projects, services at national, state and community events, and providing first aid in case of disaster. Fish farming is carried out in rural areas to improve diet.

There is a national community development project at Igbo-Ora, in Oyo State, which includes fish farming, agriculture and a training center for Scouts from all over the country. Scouts have planted crops including maize, melons and pineapples, as well as learned about mortar/mesh technology for the construction of low-cost housing. The project provides a training service to help local farmers learn new techniques.

Scouts sometimes organize social activities with Girl Guides, and the leaders of the two organizations maintain contact with each other.

Sections
The association is divided in three sections according to age:
Cub Scouts - aged 6–12 years
Scouts - aged 12–19 years
Rovers - aged 19–24 years

Ideals
Scout Promise

He served for three months as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the National League Party, a short-lived party which advocated closer ties with the United Kingdom. He was a member of the Cork Corporation, served a term as Lord Mayor of Cork.

He was born in Limerick, the son of a County Cork ironmonger, was otherwise a master plumber.

He was elected at the June 1927 general election as a TD for the Cork Borough constituency, taking his seat as one of eight National League TDs in the 5th Dáil. However, the 5th Dáil was short-lived, and at the September 1927 general election Horgan and all but two of his party's TDs lost their seats. The party went bankrupt in 1928, and was formally disbanded in 1931.

Horgan subsequently joined Cumann na nGaedheal, and stood again as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate in Cork Borough at the 1932 and 1933 general elections, but did not regain his seat.

As a member of Fine Gael, Horgan was Lord Mayor of Cork for the term from 1941 to 1942. He retired from Cork Corporation in 1949 after 25 years' membership.

He died at his residence, at 2, The Orchards, Glasheen Road, Cork, on 27 June 1955 aged 79. and is buried at St. Finbarr's Cemetery. His grandson, Seán O'Leary, served as Lord Mayor of Cork (1972–73).

116,68301474,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibbertia%20nemorosa,Hibbertia nemorosa,"Hibbertia nemorosa is a species of flowering plant in the family Dilleniaceae and is endemic to north Queensland. It is a shrub with ridged branches, oblong leaves and yellow flowers arranged singly or in pairs in leaf axils with 40 to 48 stamens and up to eight staminodes arranged around two or three carpels.

Description
Hibbertia nemorosa is a shrub with spreading, woody, ridged branches, and hairy foliage. It rarely grows to a height of more than . The leaves are oblong,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flowers are arranged singly or in pairs in leaf axils along the upper branches on a stiff peduncle  long, with linear to narrow spatula-shaped bracts  long. The five sepals are joined at the base, the outer sepal lobes  long and the inner lobes  long. The five petals are egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, yellow,  long and there are 40 to 48 stamens and up to eight staminodes arranged around the two or three densely hairy-scaly carpels, each carpel with three or four ovules. Flowering occurs from January to August.

Taxonomy
This hibbertia was first formally described in 2010 by Hellmut R. Toelken, and given the name Hibbertia heterotricha in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens from specimens collected in 1962 in the Mount Spec Range near Paluma by Clifford Gittins, in 1962. Later in 2010, in a subsequent edition of the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, Toelken changed the name to Hibbertia nemorosa because the name H. heterotricha was already in use for a different taxon (H. heterotricha Bureaeu ex Guillamin). The specific epithet (nemorosa) means ""growing in woods"", referring to the habitat of this species.

Distribution and habitat
This hibbertia grows in wet forest in the Paluma and Mount Spec ranges and on Hinchinbrook Island in north Queensland.

Conservation status
Hibbertia nemorosa is classified as of ""least concern"" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.

History
Lauterbach was founded between 400 and 800 AD. In 812 the town was mentioned for the first time in a document of the church in Schlitz. In the Middle Ages, Lauterbach belonged to the cloister in Fulda. Then in the 12th century Lauterbach became a fief of the count Ziegenhein from the cloister in Fulda. In 1266, Lauterbach received municipal rights. In the same year, Lauterbach started to build the castle (Burg) and the city wall.

Over the following centuries, ownership rights of Lauterbach changed often and were complicated.  Lauterbach became Lutheran following the Reformation.  With a pact in 1684, Lauterbach came under the control of the Riedesel zu Eisenbach (Riedesel). Up to 1806, the Riedesels had a small but independent territory. Following the Napoleonic Wars and Congress of Vienna, Lauterbach belonged to the grand duchy of Hesse. In 1852, Lauterbach became the seat of the new founded district (Kreis) of Lauterbach. In 1972, local governments were re-organized, and the new, larger district Vogelsberg was founded of which Lauterbach remains the seat of government.

Villages that belong to Lauterbach

In 1972, several villages were incorporated into the town of Lauterbach:
Allmenrod, Frischborn, Heblos, Maar, Reuters, Rimlos, Rudlos, Sickendorf, Wallenrod and Wernges.

Features
Ankerturm

The 'Ankerturm' is the only remaining tower of the city wall. It was used to be an observation tower. Temporarily it was also used as a prison.

Lauterbacher beer

Lauterbacher beer is the oldest beer in Hesse. The brand has existed since 1527.

Schrittsteine (Stepping stones)

Biography 
Williams, who had served on the Phoenix city council since 1989, was selected by the council to serve as an interim mayor of the city on March 29, 1994, following the resignation of former mayor Paul Johnson.  Johnson, who was announcing his candidacy for the office of Governor of Arizona, was forced to resign his position due to state law prohibiting current officeholders from seeking another office except in the last year of their term.  Coincidentally, Johnson had first been elevated to the office of mayor under similar circumstances when former mayor Terry Goddard had resigned his office to run for governor in 1990.

Williams chose not to seek election to the office of mayor during the 1994 special election, and resumed her duties as councilwoman on November 3, 1994.  Williams chose to challenge the new incumbent Skip Rimsza for the office during the regular elections in 1995 but was defeated; having not run for reelection in her council seat, she left the city council in 1996.  Williams ran for a new term in 2007 and was elected to a four-year term on the Phoenix city council on September 11, 2007. Williams was elected to another four-year term in 2011.

Williams was once again Phoenix's interim mayor following the resignation of Greg Stanton, who resigned in order to run successfully for U.S. Congress, on May 29, 2018. She did not declare for the ensuing special election.

125,21422847,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison%20Harvard,Allison Harvard,"Allison Elizabeth Harvard (born January 8, 1988) is an American model, artist, actress, and Internet celebrity, best known as the runner-up of both America's Next Top Model Cycles 12 and 17: All-Stars. Harvard has appeared on a number of magazine covers, such as Harper's Bazaar, L'Officiel, ONE, WeTheUrban, and one of the Philippines' leading fashion magazines, Mega. She also featured as the brand endorser of the Belo Medical Group and covered their special edition magazine.

Early life
Harvard was born in Houston, Texas, and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. She attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge before transferring to the University of New Orleans, where she studied art during Spring 2009. Her artwork is featured in the 2007 novel The Story Told at Night by Liza Kuznetsova.

In 2005, before her appearance on America's Next Top Model, Harvard gained notoriety as an Internet meme on 4chan, where she became known as Creepy-chan.

America's Next Top Model

America's Next Top Model Cycle 12 

After being contacted through an email by a casting agent who had seen her look online, Harvard successfully auditioned for the reality television show America's Next Top Model Cycle 12. During the audition, Harvard stated that she thought nosebleeds were pretty and that she was fascinated by blood.

Harvard was the fourth finalist selected (after Aminat Ayinde, Natalie Pack and Fo Porter) for the top thirteen. Her roommates in the Upper East Side New York City home were Isabella (Kelly Marie) Falk, Kortnie Coles, Sandra Nyanchoka, London (Lauren) Levi-Nance, Natalie Pack and Celia Ammerman. Over her stay, Harvard received four first call-outs and was selected to participate in two challenge prizes won by fellow contestant Celia Ammerman. Harvard had two collective bottom two appearances. The first where she overanalyzed her shoot with London (Lauren) Levi-Nance  which she survived over Nijah Harris who was eliminated third in her first ever bottom two appearance. The second time Harvard was called forward was for her lackluster commercial and her one-dimensional look that led the judges to question her versatility. This time Harvard survived for the second time over Tahlia Brookins who was eliminated sixth in her first ever bottom two appearance.
 
During the Cycle 12 Finale of ANTM in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Harvard shot a convincing CoverGirl commercial and was praised for her improvement from the previous commercial. Despite Harvard's (and Aminat Ayinde's) better performances in the CoverGirl commercial, Teyona Anderson was ultimately crowned the twelfth winner of America's Next Top Model.

America's Next Top Model Cycle 17: All-Stars 

After her first appearance on the show, Harvard was selected to return to America's Next Top Model to represent Cycle 12 (along with fellow semifinalist, later Cycle 14 contestant Angelea Preston) on the first All-Star edition of the show along with twelve other returning models from past America's Next Top Model cycles. Throughout the competition, Harvard developed her own perfume, performed in a music video for her song ""Underwater"", won two challenges, received two first call-outs and survived her first-ever bottom two appearance over Laura Kirkpatrick from America's Next Top Model Cycle 13: the ""Petite Edition"".

Career 

Harvard is currently signed with NEXT Model Management and Elite Model Management. In June 2009, Harvard signed with the Los Angeles-based Nous Model Management, but is no longer included in the agency's current roster. Since ANTM, Harvard has modelled for KarmaLoop, walked at the 2012 New York Fashion Week for Gemma Kahng and Malan Breton, and was featured in a spread for ONE Magazine. She has also modelled for Chromat and Richie Rich.

Harvard is the face of Michael Cinco's ""Impalpable"" perfume with international male model Tierry Vilson, and walked in the Philippine Fashion Week 2012 with fellow All-Stars contestant Dominique Reighard in Bench fashion shows. She was on the cover of the fifth issue of online publication WeTheUrban. In mid-2012, she appeared in promotional photos for G Fine Body Art, a beauty brand that was set to launch glittery body art services at salons and spas starting later in the fall of 2012.

In celebration of Bench's twenty-fifth anniversary, Harvard walked the runway at Bench Universe: The 2012 Denim & Underwear Show in September 2012, along with Reighard and Sophie Sumner.

On October 6, 2012, Harvard made an appearance in an episode of I Am Meg: Own the World in Style, a Philippine TV Lifestyle show on ETC.

On October 10, 2012, a behind-the-scenes clip showed Harvard in a fashion shoot for Bello Magazine, titled ""Hippie Trail"". On October 17, Harvard walked for NAVEN at the Los Angeles Fashion Week.

In October 2013, it was announced that Harvard would be one of the hosts of the Philippine television show Mega Fashion Crew: Reloaded on ETC. In 2014, she became one of the judges in a dance competition television show Celebrity Dance Battle in Philippines, which premiered on TV5 on March 22. In August 2014, Harvard booked another show for Bench called The Naked Truth and established CatxBench, a watercolor illustration designed by her, as a part of Bench Collection in December. The same month, she was a guest judge for the grand finals of Miss Earth 2014, and also appeared on America's Next Top Model to shoot in Tyra's new makeup line called TYRA along with the finalist of the season. She was also featured in the March 2015 issue of High Street Magazine with her boyfriend, Jeremy Burke.

Harvard confirmed that she would judge the Cosplay Authority Global Challenge (The CAGE) co-located with AsiaPOP Comicon Manila 2015 in Manila.

Acting

128,36294141,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement%20Weaver,Clement Weaver,"Clement Weaver (c. 1620-1683), also known as Clement Weaver Jr. and Sergeant Clement Weaver, was a member of the House of Deputies of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in 1678, one of the founders of East Greenwich, and the immigrant ancestor of thousands of Weaver descendants in the United States.  Clement Weaver and his ancestry and descendants are the subject of a 740-page volume, History and Genealogy of a Branch of the Weaver Family, published in 1928.

Early life and family

Clement Weaver was born in Glastonbury, England around 1620.  He was the son of Clement Weaver Sr. and Rebecca Holbrook, daughter of William Holbrook, a resident of that town.  Clement Weaver Sr. was the son of Thomas Weaver and Margaret Adams. There is some indication that Thomas Weaver was the son of John Weaver of Presteigne/Stapleton and London, and cousin of Richard Weaver (MP).

Clement Weaver Sr. and Rebecca Holbrook had three known children: son Clement, and daughters Elner and Elizabeth.

Life in New England

Clement Weaver and his family were part of the Great Migration to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, arriving some time before July 1640.  Clement Weaver Sr. is listed as a property owner in Weymouth in 1643, adjacent to his brother-in-law Thomas Holbrook who came to Weymouth with Rev. Joseph Hull's company in 1635.

The Weaver family's religious views at the time of their migration are not known, but they had been affiliated with the Anglican churches of Glastonbury, and were associated by marriage to the Holbrook family who held views that were in conflict with the strict Puritans of Massachusetts.  Some time after 1643, Clement Weaver and family moved to the more religiously tolerant Colony of Rhode Island.

Clement Weaver married Mary Freeborn, the daughter of William Freeborn of Essex, England, one of the signers of the Portsmouth Compact and an early member of the Society of Friends (Quakers).  Clement Weaver and Mary Freeborn had four children between 1647 and 1661: Clement, William, John and Thomas.  They also became members of the Society of Friends, and some of their descendants maintained that tradition for many generations.

By 1651, Clement Weaver ""Juneor of Nuport"" [sic] owned multiple properties in Portsmouth.  His primary farm and residence, portions of which remained in the family for over two hundred years, was west of the West Main Road between Newport and Portsmouth in what is today called Middletown.  Clement is known to have owned land in Newport, Portsmouth, Westerly, Providence and East Greenwich.  He is thought to have been a ""wall builder"" by trade.  In 1655, ""Clement Weaver Jr."" and his father are included in a list of Freemen in the Newport settlement.  Clement is referred to as Sergeant in later Newport town records - the origin and significance of the title is unknown.

Clement Weaver is listed among the 48 founders of East Greenwich who were granted 100-acre tracts in 1677 ""for the services rendered during King Philip's War"".  In 1678 Sergeant Clement Weaver became a member of the House of Deputies of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, representing the new settlement of East Greenwich, under then Governor Benedict Arnold.  He also served on the Grand Jury at various times from 1671 through 1683.

In 1680 Sergeant Clement Weaver is known to have deeded 90 acres of his grant in East Greenwich to his son Clement, also known as Captain Clement Weaver.  The Clement Weaver House built in East Greenwich in 1679 is still in existence.  It is the oldest documented dwelling house in Kent County and one of the oldest homes in Rhode Island.

Sergeant Clement Weaver died in Newport in 1683, as his will was probated in that year.  According to Quaker death records, he and his wife are buried in the Friends Cemetery in Newport (unmarked).  Clement Weaver Sr. also died in Newport in 1683, ""nearly a hundred years old"".  Captain Clement Weaver continued to represent East Greenwich in the House of Deputies at various times from 1683 to 1690.

129,2319156,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great%20Oil%20Sniffer%20Hoax,Great Oil Sniffer Hoax,"The Great Oil Sniffer Hoax was a 1979 scandal involving French oil company Elf Aquitaine.  The company spent millions of dollars to develop a new gravity wave-based oil detection system, which was later revealed to be a scam.  Elf lost over $150 million to the hoax. In France, the scandal is known as the ""Avions Renifleurs"" (""Sniffer Aircraft"").

Although Bonassoli's ""sniffer"" was a hoax, gravity is used by professional geologists to locate oil using very sensitive gravity meters. This works because gravity is a function of the mass of an object, and oil-rich deposits' density is different from the surrounding subterranean geology.

Prior to Elf 
Aldo Bonassoli, a telephone-company electrician in Ventimiglia in Italy, invented a new type of desalination system. In 1965, Belgian Count Alain de Villegas became interested in the idea and later said that ""We can live without oil, but not without water."" When the device proved not to work as expected, the team started work on a related concept, a ""water sniffer"" that would find water.

De Villegas was also a member of the Pan-European Union, an anti-communist group headquartered in Brussels. Through contacts in this group, in 1969 they met Jean Violet, a lawyer who worked for the Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage (SDECE), the French intelligence agency. Violet, who was an influential behind-the-scenes player in the pro-Europe anti-communist world, had formed the Pinay Circle in the 1950s around its titular leader, Antoine Pinay.

Violet expressed interest in the water sniffer, and agreed to attempt to arrange development funding. An attempt to interest Crosby Kelly in New York failed when Kelly stated he would only put up money if the device first proved itself able to work. A friend of Violet's, Italian industrialist Carlo Pesenti, proved more interested and agreed to start funding early development. A new company formed in Switzerland: Fisalma, Inc. (registered in Panama), under the direction of Philippe de Weck, president of Union des Banques Suisses (later part of UBS AG from the 1990s). Through contacts in Opus Dei, Violet arranged for Spain's tourism minister, Alfredo Sánchez Bella, to put several test sites in Spain at the team's disposal.

Although the tests found the sniffer to be unsuccessful, in the midst of the testing the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 broke out and oil prices quadrupled. De Villegas kept his project alive by announcing that the machines could also detect oil, persuading Pesenti to invest additional funds. Using contacts provided by Pinay, they flew their equipment to South Africa and gained government authorization to conduct tests over Zululand. Pesenti's engineers fitted one of the machines into a Douglas DC-3 for the surveys. A site claimed to be promising was identified and drilling began, but by the end of 1975 the costs had become so great that Pesenti opted out. The Zululand bore eventually bottomed out at 6,000 metres with a drill stem and no oil.

Elf involvement
Although the connection remains unclear to this day, some time in 1976 de Villegas and Bonassoli were introduced to Elf officials, apparently through de Villegas or Violet's connections in the French intelligence services. Bonassoli explained that he had been tinkering with televisions when he hit upon the idea of building his gravity wave detector that could be used to detect masses underwater - not just oil, but submarines as well. He had developed these into two machines, ""Delta"" detected oil from the air and output a paper report, while ""Omega"" mapped out the resources from closer ranges and displayed on a TV screen. He was willing to demonstrate the devices, but only if there were no scientists present, claiming that they might steal his ideas. Information about the pair's invention quickly made their way up the French political hierarchy.

In spite of the obvious scientific problems that would have turned up had they been investigated, there is no record of anyone involved having attempted any sort of scientific due diligence. Nor is there any record of any sort of background check, which would have turned up the string of previous failures. Such an obvious oversight on the part of the officials might sound odd, but writers have commented on a sort of political chauvinism that surrounded the project. At the time Elf was almost wholly controlled by the government, as were similar companies in other European nations and Canada. Unlike those companies, Elf had little crude oil supply of its own, and few known deposits for future commercialization. Elf was in danger of losing its status as a producer, at some point becoming nothing more than another refiner. If the devices could find new sources of oil practically anywhere, as was being claimed, Elf might remain among the small family of oil-producing European nations. This possibility was so attractive that the official involved overlooked any doubts that were expressed, while also keeping the project completely secret.

Between 30 April and 7 May 1976 the devices were demonstrated for Elf officials, who obliged Bonassoli's ""no scientists"" request. The devices, not much larger than a few photocopiers, were installed in a transport plane behind curtains and flown around over known oil fields. Sure enough the device flashed lights, drew lines on the attached TV, and printed paper with a sort of topographical map on it. The map looked almost identical to previously published public exploration reports. The Elf observers, including company founder Pierre Guillaumat, were completely convinced that the devices were real.

In May 1976 Elf signed a 200 million Swiss Franc (USD 80 million) contract for a two-year exclusive use while the device was tested. When this contract was complete, a second would take over in 1978 for an additional 250 million Francs (USD 130 million), expenses not included. This was apparently done without Elf's civilian board of directors being made aware of the project.

France's president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, was told of the devices in June 1976 and was aware of the development contracts being given to de Villegas' Fisalma. Four months later the new prime minister, Raymond Barre, learned of devices when his signature was required to waive various currency restrictions in order to transfer the funds abroad to the company's Swiss bank account. To keep the project secret, the funds were transferred through previously small Elf bank accounts.

Exposure
In spite of numerous ""successful"" flights, every attempt to drill at the indicated locations came up empty. Bonassoli repeatedly stated that it appeared to be ""too accurate"" to be used and required further development. Their Elf contacts remained confident in the devices in spite of the failures, and would happily provide documentation of previous studies on the fields that were going to be flown over in the tests. These studies were then parroted back through the devices, further convincing the Elf managers that the devices worked.

Things started to change when management of Elf passed from Guillaumat to Albin Chalandon. Initially a supporter of the project, after examining project documentation, Chalandon was forced to admit that there was not a single usable result from the tests. In May 1979 he arranged for Jules Horowitz, chief of research and development for France's atomic energy agency, to visit the lab and examine ""Omega"". Instead of examining the device itself, he started asking Bonassoli questions about the Omega's capability to detect various common objects through a wall. After two failures, Bonassoli eventually agreed that it could easily detect a metal ruler. Bonassoli turned on the device, and sure enough out came a piece of paper with a short line on it. Horowitz returned from behind the wall and held up the ruler, which he had bent into a L shape while hidden from view.

Oddly, work continued. A month later another demonstration further revealed the hoax. Omega was shown to be outputting graphics projected from within the box. Further investigation showed that what was inside one cabinet did not simply appear to be a photocopier, but actually was a photocopier. This was the reason the devices' output always looked so similar to previous reports; Bonassoli was hand-copying them, and then simply pressed ""copy"" to generate output that looked similar, but slightly different, than the originals they had provided. Bonassoli attempted to deflect all criticism by stating that the entire secret of the device was one key component, which was locked in a box that he refused to open. But it was too late, Elf realized they had been hoodwinked.

Even after the hoax was discovered, the government did little to address the problem. Bonassoli managed to successfully return to Italy, where he became something of a folk hero. Elf never completed paying for the final contract, but nevertheless had spent over $150 million in total.

Political scandal 
All of France's quasi-public corporations were audited by the Cour des Comptes. In 1979 the magistrate in charge of Elf's audit, François Giquel, asked about the sudden change in certain accounts. These had contained only small amounts of money for many years, around 3 million Francs, and then suddenly grew to hundreds of millions of Francs over the last three years. The President personally informed Giquel that it was a matter of military secret, and he was sworn to secrecy. In 1982, Bernard Beck, president of the Cour des Comptes and a political ally of Giscard d'Estaing, shredded three key documents about the case at the auditor's office, as well as Giquel's office copy.

The story finally broke in December 1983. The junior Secretary for the Treasury publicly accused Beck of forfaiture (""abuse of authority"") for destroying the documents. The same week Pierre Péan published a complete history of the story in the satirical magazine Le Canard Enchaîné, apparently tipped off by government insiders. The new president, François Mitterrand, seized on the story to attack his predecessor for his involvement in the ""cover up"", going on to claim that they had destroyed all of the documents. Giscard d'Estaing responded on television, brandishing another copy of the report which he had in his own possession, and claiming that its existence proved that the entire affair was simply a case of political maneuvering.

This proved to be a bad idea; the report was seized and subsequently published in full. On 2 January 1984 it was released live on television by the new Prime Minister, Pierre Mauroy. Mauroy sarcastically accused Barre and Giscard of trying to cover up the embarrassing story. Giscard appeared on television a second time, attacking Mitterrand for ""having allowed his predecessor to be attacked"". The Economist claimed that Mitterrand used his influence to have a public investigation into Giscard quashed.

Bonassoli reappears
In January 1984, Bonassoli held a press conference in Italy, claiming that he would hand over all the data on his machine to the Italian National Research Council (CNR). He also stated that the Soviets had expressed an interest in the machine. When asked about the claims of fraud, Bonassoli simply replied that the machine had been greatly improved since the 1970s. Nothing ever came of the announcement.

130,1713163,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain%20hut,Mountain hut,"A mountain hut is a building located high in the mountains, generally accessible only by foot, intended to provide food and shelter to mountaineers, climbers and hikers. Mountain huts are usually operated by an Alpine Club or some organization dedicated to hiking or mountain recreation. They are known by many names, including alpine hut, mountain shelter, mountain refuge, mountain lodge, and mountain hostel.

Mountain huts can provide a range of services, starting with shelter and simple sleeping berths. Some, particularly in remote areas, are not staffed, but others have staff which prepare meals and drinks and can provide other services, including providing lectures and selling clothing and small items.  Mountain huts usually allow anybody to access their facilities, although some require reservations.

While shelters have long existed in mountains, modern hut systems date back a century and a half. The Swiss Alpine Club has built huts since 1863. In the United States, the Appalachian Mountain Club built its first hut at Madison Spring in New Hampshire in 1889.

Huts

The Alps
The construction of refuges and shelters in the Alps date back to ancient times, when Roman roads led across the mountain passes. In the High Middle Ages, hospitales were erected along the trade routes; cottages and sheds on the high mountain pastures served for Alpine transhumance. The long history of mountaineering from the 19th century onwards has led to a large number of Alpine club huts as well as private huts along the mountaineering paths. These huts are categorised according to their location and facilities. They may have beds or a mattress room (Matratzenlager) for overnight stays.

Just as the Margherita Hut in the Valais Alps is the highest alpine refuge at 4,554 m, the Rifugio Mario Premuda in Trieste owned by the Italian Alpine Association is the lowest refuge in the Alps at 82 m.

Britain
In the United Kingdom the tradition is of unwardened ""climbing huts"" providing fairly rudimentary accommodation (but superior to that of a bothy) close to a climbing ground; the huts are usually conversions (e.g. of former quarrymen's cottages, or of disused mine buildings), and are not open to passers-by except in emergency. Many climbing clubs in the UK have such huts in Snowdonia or in the Lake District. A well-known example is the Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut (the 'CIC Hut') - a purpose-built hut below the northern crags of Ben Nevis in Scotland.
In the past, some shelters in Scotland were built in exposed locations at high elevation, often as part of military training exercises. However, and particularly following the 1971 Cairngorm Plateau Disaster, these were deliberately demolished because they were thought to pose dangers exceeding their benefits.

Norway
The Norwegian Trekking Association operates about 460 cabins mostly in the mountains and in forested areas, of which about 400 have lodgings. Many cabins are unstaffed and open all year, while the staffed cabins often are just open during summer.

Poland
In Poland most mountain shelters and huts are run by the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society, with some being privately owned. In the Polish mountains, there are about 100 shelters. Most mountain shelters offer multi-person rooms and refreshments. Polish mountain huts are obliged by their own regulations to overnight each person who is not able to find any other place before sunset, though the conditions may be spartan (e.g. a mattress in a hall or warm basement).

Slovakia
In Slovakia there is a dense network of mountain huts (""chata"") in most mountain and forest regions, serving a culture of hiking. In the past they were managed by the official tourist union, but now are mostly in private hands. Official mountain huts are similar to guest houses and are run by full-time managers. In winter, some refuges are closed.

United States
There are many huts in the United States, for example in the Rocky Mountains, the Appalachian Mountains and other ranges. The High Huts of the White Mountains in New Hampshire are generally ""full service"" (cooks serve food) through summer and early fall, while some are open the rest of the year as self-service huts, at which hikers bring and prepare their own food.

Canada
The Alpine Club of Canada operates what it calls the ""largest network of backcountry huts in North America.""

New Zealand 
The New Zealand Department of Conservation ""manages a network of over 950 huts of all shapes and sizes.""

The Himalayas
The mountains of Asia do not have a well-developed system of public mountain huts, although hiking, trekking and mountain climbing are common. In 2015, a competition was launched to design huts that could be located along trekking trails of Nepal.

South Africa 
Many places in Africa have hiking huts but they are usually privately owned and require payment and reservations. At least one hut is open for public use on Table Mountain in South Africa, part of Table Mountain National Park.

The season begins six months after the birth of Tina and Bette's daughter, Angelica. New characters in this season include Moira Sweeney (a working class butch portrayed by Daniela Sea who is Jenny's girlfriend for most of the season) and Angus Partridge (portrayed by Dallas Roberts), Angelica's male nanny who later becomes Kit's lover. Sweeney starts the process of transitioning switching his name to Max. Erin Daniels' character, Dana Fairbanks, starts in a multi-episode storyline dealing with a breast cancer battle and culminating with her death. Notable of this season is that each episode begins with a short pre-credits vignette of two individuals meeting romantically or sexually. As the season progresses, lines from Alice's chart (see here) connect one member of each vignette with a new individual in the next. Helena's character storyline was switched from being Bette's rival into a new member of the circle of friends. Her story arc for the season involves the acquisition of a movie studio in which Tina later works and which further derives a sexual harassment lawsuit that triggers her mother to cut her off financially in the season finale. Sarah Shahi's character, Carmen de la Pica Morales, ends her appearance in the show in the finale when Shane leaves her at the altar.

133,63345042,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Neade,William Neade,"William Neade () was an English inventor, known for inventing a weapon combining a longbow and a pike.

The invention
Neade began experiments in James I's reign with a ""warlike invention of the bow and the pike"", an arrangement by which a bow could be attached to a movable pivot in the middle of the pike, thus making a combined weapon for offence or for close quarters. In 1624 he exhibited his invention before the King in St James's Park, and the Honourable Artillery Company soon afterwards made trial of it.

A manuscript Neade had presented to the King was published in 1625, with six plates, as The double-armed man, by the new invention: briefly shewing some famous exploits atchieved by our Brittish bowmen, with severall portraitures proper for the pike and bow.

In July 1633 he petitioned the council to approve ""a direction for a commission to authorise the inventor to teach the service and for a proclamation to command the general exercise thereof"". On 12 August the proclamation was issued at Oatlands Palace, and five days later a commission was given to Neade and his son William to instruct lieutenants of counties and justices of the peace in the exercise. The specification of the patent which was granted to Neade in the following year recites that he had spent many years in practising the weapon.

In 1635 and again in 1637 Neade informed the King that he had laid out his whole estate of £600 on his invention, ""but by the evil example of the city of London the service is now wholly neglected"", although three hundred of the Artillery Company had given an exhibition of the weapon in action before King Charles in St James's Park. The council seems to have meditated some fresh concessions to Neade, but no further reference to the matter exists.

134,493842,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution%20in%20Germany,Prostitution in Germany,"Prostitution in Germany is legal, as are other aspects of the sex industry, including brothels, advertisement, and job offers through HR companies. Full-service sex work is widespread and regulated by the German government, which levies taxes on it. In 2016, the government adopted a new law, the Prostitutes Protection Act, in an effort to improve the legal situation of sex workers, while also now enacting a legal requirement for registration of prostitution activity and banning prostitution which involves no use of condoms. The social stigmatization of sex work persists and many workers continue to lead a double life. Human rights organizations consider the resulting common exploitation of women from Eastern and Southeastern Europe to be the main problem associated with the profession.

History

Middle Ages to Confederation (1815) 
Sex work in historically German lands has never been outlawed and has been described since the Middle Ages. Since the 13th century, several German cities operated brothels known as Frauenhäuser (""women's houses"");

the practice of sex work was considered a necessary evil, a position already held by Saint Augustine (354-430). Some municipalities actively encouraged it and far from existing on the margins, sex workers were often honoured guests, who maintained domestic order as an outlet and lesser evil to such things as adultery and rape. The city also gained tax revenues from the prostitutes.

Emperor Sigismund (1368–1437) thanked the city of Konstanz in writing for providing some 1,500 workers for the Council of Constance which took place from 1414 to 1418.

Sex workers were more vigorously persecuted beginning in the 16th century, with the start of the Reformation and the appearance of syphilis. In 1530, Charles V ordered the closure of brothels throughout the German Holy Roman Empire.

Section 999 of the 1794 General State Laws for the Prussian States determined that ""dissolute female persons who want to do business with their bodies ... would have to go into the whoredom houses tolerated under the supervision of the state"".

The Confederations (1815–1871)
Beginning in the 19th century, sex workers in many regions had to register with police or local health authorities and submit to regular health checks to curb venereal diseases.

The so-called Bremer Regulations of 1852 stated that prostitution was ""not a trade in the true sense"". By this distinction between prostitution and other trades, immorality of prostitution was defined in law.

German Empire (1871–1918)
In Imperial Germany (1871–1918) attitudes to sex work were ambivalent. While sex work was tolerated as a necessary function to provide for male sexuality outside of marriage, it was frowned on as a threat to contemporary moral images of women's sexuality. Therefore, state policy concentrated on regulation rather than abolition. This was mainly at the municipal level. The Criminal Code of 1871 prohibited brothels and ""commercial fornication"". In the 1876 version, prostitution was only punishable if the woman worked outside police supervision. State regulation at the time created an atmosphere which defined what was considered proper, and what was proper feminine sexuality.

Controls were particularly tight in the port city of Hamburg. The regulations included defining the dress and conduct of prostitutes both inside and outside the brothel, thus making the occupation define their lives as a separate class of women on the margins of society.

At the beginning of the 20th century, prostitution was considered ""harmful to communities"".  Nevertheless, there existed or originated in the 20th century, various brothel and red-light districts such as Helenenstraße in Bremen (from 1878), Linienstraße in Dortmund (from 1904), Stahlstraße in Essen (from about 1900), Rampenloch in Minden (from 1908), Im Winkel in Bochum (from about 1912), and the Flaßhofstraße in Oberhausen (from 1910 and 1963). It is estimated that in 1900 there were 50,000 women working in Berlin (population 1 December 1900: 1,888,848).

Weimar Republic (1918–1933)
In Weimar-era Germany the economy collapsed due to the loss of the First World War and the imposition of war reparations at the Treaty of Versailles. As a result, the middle class lost their savings and the working class were unemployed. The Republic ended up printing money to pay its bills which lead to hyperinflation in 1923. The outcome of all of this was that women, including the millions of war widows, turned to prostitution. Licentiousness and streetwalking were common in this period and Weimar Berlin is famed for its decadence.

An STD Act was discussed and adopted in 1927. It was accompanied by the decriminalisation of prostitution.

Nazi era (1933–1945) 
During the Nazi era, street based sex workers were seen as ""asocial"" and degenerate and were at times sent to concentration camps, especially to the Ravensbrück camp. The Nazis did not entirely disapprove of sex work though and instead installed a centralized system of city brothels, military brothels (Wehrmachtsbordelle), brothels for foreign forced laborers, and concentration camp brothels.

During the Second World War, the German Wehrmacht established about 100 Wehrmacht brothels in the occupied territories, including France, Poland, Italy, and Norway. Lothar-Günther Buchheim described his impressions from Brest: ""If a large ship had arrived, the hookers simply laid there between sailors."" Military prostitution was regulated, ""Only a permit from the military command brothel allowed you to visit. Always use a condom (rubber protection). For the German soldiers there was a disinfectant syringe in the urethra.""

Between 1942 and 1945, camp brothels were installed in ten concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Himmler intended these as an incentive for cooperative and hard-working non-Jewish and non-Russian inmates, in order to increase the productivity of the work camps. Initially the brothels were staffed mostly with former sex worker inmates who volunteered, but women were also put under pressure to work there.
In the documentary film, Memory of the Camps, a project supervised by the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information during the summer of 1945, camera crews filmed women who stated that they were forced into sexual slavery for the use of guards and favored prisoners. The filmmakers stated that as the women died they were replaced by women from the concentration camp Ravensbrück.

None of the women who were forced to work in these concentration camp brothels ever received compensation, since the German compensation laws do not cover persons designated as ""asocial"" by the Nazis.

In a famous case of espionage, the Nazi intelligence service SD took over the luxurious Berlin brothel Salon Kitty and equipped it with listening devices and specially trained sex workers. From 1939 to 1942 the brothel was used to spy on important visitors.

German Democratic Republic (GDR 1945–1990) 

After World War II, the country was divided into East Germany (German Democratic Republic) and West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany from 1949–90). In East Germany, as in all countries of the communist Eastern Bloc, full-service sex work was illegal and according to the official position, it didn't exist. There were high-class sex workers working in the hotels of East Berlin and the other major cities, mainly targeting Western visitors; the Stasi employed some of these for spying purposes. Street-based workers were available for the pleasure of visiting Westerners, too.

Federal Republic of Germany (BRD 1945–2001) 
In West Germany, the registration and testing requirements remained in place but were handled quite differently in the regions of the country. In Bavaria, in addition to scheduled Sexually transmitted disease (STD) check-ups, regular tests for HIV were required from 1987, but this was an exception. Many sex workers did not submit to these tests, avoiding the registration. A study in 1992 found that only 2.5% of the tested workers had a disease, a rate much lower than the one among comparable non-sex workers.

In 1967, Europe's largest brothel at the time, the six-floor Eros Center, was opened on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg. An even larger one, the twelve-floor building now called Pascha in Cologne was opened in 1972. The AIDS scare of the late 1980s had an effect on the business, and the Eros Center closed, as well as several other brothels in Hamburg. The Pascha continued to flourish, and has evolved into a chain with additional brothels in Munich and Salzburg.

Anything which led to the ""promotion of prostitution"" (Förderung der Prostitution) remained a crime until 2001, even after the extensive criminal law reforms of 1973. This placed operators of brothels under the threat of potential legal action. Most brothels were, therefore, run as a bar with an attached but legally separate room rental. Many municipalities built, ran and profited from high rise or townhouse-style high-rent Dirnenwohnheime (lit.: ""whores' dormitories""), to keep street-based sex work and pimping under control. Here workers sold sex in a room they rented by the day. These establishments, called ""Laufhäuser"" in Johns' jargon are now mostly privatized and operate as Eros Centers. Even before the 2001 reform, many upmarket sex workers operated in their own apartments, alone or with other women. Luxurious country houses, called ""FKK-Sauna-Clubs"" are the exclusive end of prostitution in Germany. There, women and men pay the same entrance fees ranging from about €50 to 100 and usually include meals and drinks and the sex workers negotiate their deals with the individual clients, thus avoiding the appearance of pimping (""Zuhälterei""). Illegal variations on that business model, like ""Flaterate-Clubs"" and ""Pauschalclubs"" also exist and advertise openly in daily newspapers and the Internet. These establishments charge an ""all-you-can handle"" fee of about €75 to €90.

Before the 2002 prostitution law, the highest courts of Germany repeatedly ruled that sex work offends good moral order (verstößt gegen die guten Sitten), with several legal consequences. Any contract that is considered immoral is null and void, so a sex worker could not sue for payment. Sex workers working out of their apartments could lose their leases. Finally, bars and inns could be denied a licences if sex work took place on their premises.

In 1999, Felicitas Weigmann lost the licence for her Berlin cafe Psst!, because the cafe was being used to initiate contacts between customers and sex work and had an attached room-rental also owned by Weigmann. She sued the city, arguing that society's position had changed and sex work no longer qualified as offending the moral order. The judge conducted an extensive investigation and solicited a large number of opinions. In December 2000 the court agreed with Weigmann's claim. This ruling is considered as precedent and important factor in the realization of the Prostitution Law of 1 January 2002. Only after an appeal process though, filed by the Berlin town district, was Weigmann to regain her café license in October 2002.

The compulsory registration and testing of workers was abandoned in 2001. Anonymous, free and voluntary health testing has been made available to everyone, including illegal immigrants. Many brothel operators require these tests.

Modern era

Legislative reform (2002) 
In 2002 a one-page law sponsored by the Green Party was passed by the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Greens in the Bundestag. The law, the Prostitution Act (Prostitutionsgesetz), removed the general prohibition on furthering full-service sex work and allowed sex workers to obtain regular work contracts. The law's rationale stated that sex work should not be considered as immoral anymore.

The law has been criticized as having not effectively changed the situation of the sex workers, believed to be because some workers themselves don't want to change their working conditions and contracts. The German government issued a report on the law's impact in January 2007, concluding that few sex workers had taken advantage of regular work contracts and that work conditions had improved only to 35% workers.

Post 2002 

Between 2000 and 2003, the visa issuing policies of German consulates were liberalized. The opposition claimed that this resulted in an increase in human trafficking and sex workers entering the country illegally, especially from Ukraine. The episode led to hearings in 2005 and is known as the German Visa Affair 2005.

In 2004, the Turkish gang leader Necati Arabaci was sentenced to 9 years in prison for pimping, human trafficking, assault, extortion, weapons violations and racketeering. His gang of bouncers controlled the night clubs in Cologne's entertainment district, the Ring, where they befriended girls in order to exploit them as sex workers. After Arabaci's arrest, informants overheard threats against the responsible prosecutor, who received police protection and fled the country in 2007 when Arabaci was deported to Turkey.

In 2004, the large FKK-brothel Colosseum opened in Augsburg, and police suspected a connection to Arabaci's gang, which owned several similar establishments and was supposedly directed from prison by its convicted leader.

After several raids, police determined that the managers of the brothel dictated the prices that the women had to charge, prohibited them from sitting in groups or using cell phones during work, set the work hours, searched rooms and handbags, and made them work completely nude (charging a penalty of €10 per infraction). In April 2006, five men were charged with pimping. The court quashed the charges, arguing that the prostitution law of 2002 created a regular employer-employee relationship and thus gave the employer certain rights to direct the working conditions. Colosseum remained in business.

In early 2005, the media in Great Britain reported that a woman refusing to take a job as a sex worker might have her unemployment benefits reduced or removed altogether.
A similar account had appeared in mid-2003; a woman received a job offer through a private employment agency. In this case, the agency apologized for the mistake, stating that a request for a sex worker would normally have been rejected, but the client misled them, describing the position as ""a female barkeeper."" To date, there have been no reported cases of women actually losing benefits in such a case, and the employment agencies have stated that women would not be made to work in sex work.

In March 2007, the brothel ""Pascha"" in Cologne announced that senior citizens above the age of 66 would receive a discount during afternoons; half of the price of €50 for a ""normal session"" would be covered by the house. Earlier, in 2004, a 20% discount for long-term unemployed had been announced by a brothel in Dresden.

Also in 2007, authorities in Berlin began to close several apartment brothels that had existed for many years. They cited a 1983 court decision that found that the inevitable disturbances caused by brothels were incompatible with residential areas. Sex workers' rights groups and brothel owners fought these efforts. They commissioned a study that concluded that apartment brothels in general neither promote criminality nor disturb neighbors.

The economic downturn of 2009 has resulted in changes at some brothels. Reduced prices and free promotions are now found. Some changes, the result of modern marketing tools, rebates, gimmicks. Brothels introducing all-inclusive flat-rates, free shuttle buses, discounts for seniors and taxi drivers. ""Day passes."" Some brothels reportedly including loyalty cards, group sex parties, rebates for golf players. Clients have reported reducing their number of weekly visits.

In 2009, the Bundessozialgericht ruled that the German job agencies are not required to find sex workers for open positions in brothels. The court rejected the complaint of a brothel owner who had argued that the law of 2002 had turned sex work into a job like any other; the judges ruled that the law had been passed to protect the employees, not to further the business.

The effects of the reforms continue to be debated. A five-part series in Der Spiegel in 2013 claimed it was a failure. Others have argued that, while the German model still has many weaknesses, it has reduced violence against sex workers.

In 2014, a startup in Berlin launched Peppr, an app for prostitution.

The Criminal Code was amended in October 2016 to criminalise clients of trafficked or coerced prostitutes. This change was led by Social Democrat Eva Högl.

The Prostituiertenschutzgesetz (Prostitutes Protection Act) came into force in July 2017. Amongst the provision of the Act are registration of prostitutes, annual health checks and mandatory condom use. Brothel operators also need to register and prove their 'good conduct' before registration. The legislation also places restrictions on advertising.

Football World Cup 2006 

Officials speculated that up to 40,000 illegal sex workers, mainly from Eastern European countries, would enter Germany for the Football World Cup, held in Germany in the summer of 2006. Women and church groups were planning a ""Red card to forced prostitution"" campaign with the aim of alerting World Cup visitors to the existence of forced sex trafficking. They asked for support from the national football team and the national football organization but were initially rebuffed. In March 2006, the president of the German football federation turned around and agreed to support a campaign named ""Final Whistle – Stop Forced Prostitution"". The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Nordic Council and Amnesty International also expressed concern over an increase in the trafficking of women and forced sex trafficking up to and during the World Cup.

In March 2006, the campaign ""Responsible John. Prostitution without compulsion and violence"" was started by the government of Berlin. It provides a list of signs of forced sex trafficking and urges sex workers' customers to call a hotline if they spot one of those signs.

In April 2006, an advertisement for the Pascha brothel in Cologne that featured a several story-high image of a half-naked young woman with the flags of 2006 FIFA World Cup countries sparked outrage after Muslims were offended by the inclusion of the Saudi Arabian and Iranian flags. Pascha's owner, Armin Lobscheid, said a group of Muslims had threatened violence over the advertisement, and he blacked out the two flags. The Tunisian flag that features the Muslim crescent remained on the advertisement.

On 30 June 2006, The New York Times reported that the expected increase in prostitution activity around the World Cup had not taken place. This was confirmed by the 2006 BKA report on human trafficking, which reported only 5 cases of human trafficking related to the World Cup.

COVID-19 pandemic
Social distancing as a preventative measure during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany caused a marked reduction in the number of visitors to brothels, some operators reporting a 50% reduction in business. Several federal states ordered entertainment venues to close on 14 March 2020, followed by the Central Government ordering a nationwide closure on 22 March 2020. (Brothels are classed as entertainment venues in Germany.)

According to Susanne Bleier Wilp of the Association for Erotic and Sexual Services Providers lobby group in Berlin, 80% of the prostitutes working in Germany are foreign, mainly from Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, and Ukraine. Many of them lived in the brothels. Whilst most have returned to their home countries, some had been made homeless by the brothel closures.

The Berufsverband erotische und sexuelle Dienstleistungen (the association of erotic and sexual services) published a new hygiene concept for sex workers. It has three parts, one for sex workers who work in their own apartments, one for escorts and one for street prostitutes.

Thuringia
The Thuringian Corona Ordinance has decided to keep all the prostitution-related facilities closed until 31 August 2020. The hygiene concepts referred to by brothel operators were all denied. Due to the physical closeness related to such services, it is impossible to counteract the dangers of getting infected effectively.

Hamburg
On Herbertstraße on St. Pauli, 400 prostitutes and brothel operators protested for the reopening of brothels on 11 July 2020. According to the professional association for erotic and sexual services, the fact that body-related services such as tattoo studios, hairdressers and massage salons are allowed to work during the COVID-19 crisis is unfair.

Munich
As of March 2020, all brothels in Trudering, Munich are closed due to the coronavirus crisis. Prostitutes continue to work outside of regulated establishments. They are allowed to set appointments with clients in the non-restricted areas of the city. As long as brothels are not allowed to open, prostitution will continue to take place outside the brothels.

Extent of prostitution and associated issues 
Studies in the early 1990s estimated that about 50,000–200,000 women and some men did sex work in Germany. The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality, published in 1997, reported that over 100,000 women work in prostitution in Germany. A 2005 study gave 200,000 as a ""halfway realistic estimate"". The prostitutes' organization Hydra puts the number at 400,000, and this number is typically quoted in the press today. A 2009 study by TAMPEP also gave the Hydra estimate of 400,000 full or part-time prostitutes, with 93% being gender female, 3% transgender and 4% gender male.

The same study found that 63% of the sex workers in Germany were foreigners, with two thirds of them coming from Central and Eastern Europe. In 1999 the proportion of foreign sex workers had been 52%. The increase was attributed to the EU enlargement.

From other studies, it is estimated that between 10% and 30% of the male adult population have had experiences with sex workers. Of those 17-year-old males in West Germany with experience of intercourse, 8% have had sex with a sex worker.

A 2009 survey identified the following main vulnerability factors for German sex workers (in the order of importance):
 Financial problems, including debts and poverty.
 Violence and abuse by police, clients, and pimps.
 No professional identity; lack of self-confidence.
 Stigma and discrimination.
 Exploitative personal dependencies.

Forms of female prostitution

Street prostitution (Straßenstrich) 

Regular street-based sex work is often quite well organized and controlled by pimps. Most cities established ""Sperrbezirke"" (off-limits zones) and charge the street based workers an amusement tax, that in the city of Bonn for instance is paid by the sex workers at parking meters, six euro for a period of about eight night hours. The same fee is collected from sex workers in apartments and brothels, sometimes by municipal tax collectors in person. Some sex workers have a nearby caravan, others use the customer's car, still, others use hotel rooms. With recent economic problems, in some large cities ""wild"" street-based sex work has started to appear: areas where women work temporarily out of short-term financial need.  A ""sex drive-in"", or ""Verrichtungsbox"", is a facility of structures to enclose cars to provide a safer place for sex work using cars.

Prostitution for the procurement of narcotics 
In every major German city, there are prostitutes who offer their services to procure drugs. This often takes place near the main railway stations, while the act usually takes place in the customer's car or in a nearby rented room. These prostitutes are the most desperate, often underage, and their services are generally the cheapest. Pimps and brothel owners try to avoid drug-addicted prostitutes, as they are inclined to spend their earnings solely or primarily on drugs. Other prostitutes tend to look down on them as well, because they are considered as lowering the market prices.

In a unique effort to move drug-addicted streetwalkers out of the city center and reduce violence against these women, the city of Cologne in 2001 created a special area for tolerated street prostitution in Geestemünder Straße. Dealers and pimps are not tolerated, the parking places have alarm buttons and the women are provided with a cafeteria, showers, clean needles and counselling. The project, modelled on the Dutch tippelzones, is supervised by an organisation of Catholic women. A positive scientific evaluation was published in 2004.

Bars 
In bars, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual services. Sex usually takes place in a separate but attached building. Prices are mostly set by the bar owner and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. The prevalence of such practices has diminished as a result of the registration obligation in the Prostitutes Protection Act.

Eros centers (Bordell, Laufhaus)

An eros center is a house (Laufhaus) or street (Laufstraße) where women can rent small one-room apartments for 80–150 euro per day. Then they solicit customers from the open door or from behind a window. Prices are normally set by the prostitutes; they start at 250–500 euros for short-time sex. The money is not shared with the brothel owner. Security and meals are provided by the owner. The women may even live in their rooms, but most do not. Minors and women not working in the eros center are not allowed to enter. Eros centers exist in almost all larger German cities. The most famous is the Herbertstraße near the Reeperbahn in Hamburg. The largest brothel in Europe is the eros center Pascha in Cologne, a 12-storey building with some 120 rooms for rent and several bars.

Apartment prostitution (Wohnungspuffs) 
There are many of these advertised in the daily newspapers. Sometimes run by a single woman or man and sometimes by a group of roommates.

Partytreffs and Pauschalclubs 
These are a variation on partner-swapping swing clubs with (sometimes, but not always) paid prostitutes in attendance, as well as 'amateur' women and couples. Single men pay a flat-rate entrance charge of about €80 to €150, which includes food, drink and unrestricted sexual activity, with the requirement that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests. Women normally pay a low or zero entrance charge.

FKK sauna clubs 

Typically, these are brothels in houses or large buildings, often with swimming pool and sauna, a large 'meet and greet' room with bar and buffet on the ground floor, TV/video screens, and bedrooms on the upper floor(s). Operating hours are usually from late morning until after midnight. The female sex workers are typically nude (hence the FKK euphemism, erroneously referring to the German FKK 'Freikörperkultur' nudist culture) or topless, customers or club members wear robes or towels. Men and women often pay the same entrance fee, from €35 to €70, including use of all facilities and refreshments (beer is allowed, but most FKK sauna clubs do not allow liquor). Some clubs will admit couples. This form of prostitution, which was mentioned in the rationale of the 2002 prostitution law as providing good working conditions for the women workers, exists all over Germany, Austria and parts of the Netherlands, but mainly in the Rhein-Ruhrgebiet and in the area around Frankfurt am Main. Among the largest clubs of this type are: Artemis in Berlin, opened in the fall of 2005, the new Harem in Bad Lippspringe and the long-established FKK World near Giessen and FKK Oase in the countryside near Bad Homburg.

Escort services (Begleitagenturen) 
Escort services, where a potential male client calls for a woman to visit a residence or at a hotel for sexual services, exist in Germany.

For special groups
Sexual services for the disabled and elderly. The agency Sensis in Wiesbaden connects prostitutes with disabled customers. Nina de Vries somewhat controversially provides sexual services to severely mentally disabled men and has been repeatedly covered in the media. Professional training is available for 'sex assistants'.

Forms of male prostitution 
A comparatively small number of males offer sexual services to females, usually in the form of escort services, meeting in hotels. The vast majority of male prostitutes serve male clients. In 2007 it was estimated that there were 2,500 male prostitutes in Berlin. The above-mentioned Pascha brothel in Cologne reserves one entire floor for male and transgender prostitutes.

Legal situation 
Prostitution is legal in Germany. However, since 2017, prostitutes are required to obtain two-year valid registration certificates after undergoing prescribed health advice, while businesses involved in prostitution must possess legal permits. Both prostitution without the use of condoms and the advertisement of prostitution involving either no condoms or pregnant women is also illegal as well. Prostitutes may work as regular employees with contract and also supposed to register with the local authority which provides them a document colloquially called hurenpass, though the vast majority work independently. Brothels are registered businesses that need a special brothel licence; if food and alcoholic drinks are offered, the standard restaurant licence is also required.

Prostitutes have to pay income taxes and have to charge VAT for their services, to be paid to the tax office. In practice, prostitution is a cash business and taxes are not always paid, though enforcement has been strengthened. The Länder North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden Württemberg and Berlin have initiated a system where prostitutes have to pay their taxes in advance, a set amount per day, to be collected and paid to tax authorities by the brothel owners. North Rhine-Westphalia charges €25 per day per prostitute, while Berlin charges €30. In May 2007, authorities were considering plans for a uniform country-wide system charging €25 per day.

Until 2002, prostitutes and brothels were technically not allowed to advertise, but that prohibition was not enforced. The Bundesgerichtshof ruled in July 2006 that, as a consequence of the new prostitution law, advertising of sexual services is no longer illegal.  Many newspapers carry daily ads for brothels and for women working out of apartments. Many prostitutes and brothels have websites on the Internet. In addition, sex shops and newsstands sell magazines specialising in advertisements of prostitutes (""Happy Weekend"", ""St Pauli Nachrichten"", ""Sexy"" and many more).

Foreign women from European Union countries are allowed to work as prostitutes in Germany. Women from other countries can obtain three-month tourist visas for Germany. If they work in prostitution, it is illegal, because the tourist visa does not include a work permit.

Pimping, (Zuhälterei = exploiting and/or controlling a sex worker) admitting prostitutes under the age of eighteen to a brothel, and influencing persons under the age of twenty-one to take up or continue work in prostitution, are illegal. It is also illegal to contract sex services from any person younger than 18, per Article 182 (paragraph 2) of the Criminal Code. Before 2008 this age limit was 16. This law also applies to Germans traveling abroad, to combat child prostitution occurring in the context of sex tourism.

Municipal regulation 
The first city in Germany to introduce an explicit prostitution tax was Cologne. The tax was initiated early in 2004 by the city council led by a coalition of the conservative CDU and the leftist Greens. This tax applies to striptease, peep shows, porn cinemas, sex fairs, massage parlors, and prostitution. In the case of prostitution, the tax amounts to €150 per month and working prostitute, to be paid by brothel owners or by privately working prostitutes. (The area Geestemünder Straße mentioned above is exempt.) Containment of prostitution was one explicitly stated goal of the tax. In 2006 the city took in €828,000 through this tax. The neighboring city of Bonn collects a nightly sex work tax of six euro from street prostitutes in the Immenburgstrasse by vending machines identical to German parking meters. All other areas of the city are Sperrbezirk (off-limits for street prostitution).

Every city has the right to zone off certain areas where prostitution is not allowed (Sperrbezirk). Prostitutes found working in these areas can be fined or, when persistent, jailed. The various cities handle this very differently. In Berlin prostitution is allowed everywhere, and Hamburg allows street prostitution near the Reeperbahn during certain times of the day. Almost the entire center of Munich is Sperrbezirk, and under-cover police have posed as clients to arrest prostitutes. In Leipzig, street prostitution is forbidden almost everywhere, and the city even has a local law allowing police to fine customers who solicit prostitution in public. In most smaller cities, the Sperrbezirk includes the immediate city center as well as residential areas. Several states prohibit brothels in small towns (such as towns with fewer than 35,000 inhabitants).

This concept has been the subject of a number of legal challenges. In North Rhine-Westphalia a Minden court has ruled against 'Sperrbezirk', as have courts in Hesse and Bavaria. The court ruled that a general prohibition of prostitution infringed a basic right to choose one's occupation, as laid down in the 2002 Prostitution Act.

Health 
Annual health checks for prostitutes are mandated by law in Germany.
Previously, in Bavaria (Bayern), law mandates the use of condoms for sexual intercourse with prostitutes, including oral contact. In 2017 this was extended to the whole of Germany.

Crime 
The 1957 murder of the high-class prostitute Rosemarie Nitribitt in Frankfurt drew great media attention in postwar Germany. The circumstances of her death remain obscure. Police investigations turned up no substantial leads other than a prime suspect who was later acquitted due to reasonable doubt. Several high-profile, respectable citizens turned out to have been among her customers, a fact on which the media based insinuations that higher social circles might be covering up and obstructing the search for the real murderer. The scandal inspired two movies.

Werner Pinzner was a contract murderer active in the brothel scene of Hamburg in the 1980s. Captured in 1986, he confessed to eight murders of people involved in prostitution businesses. His long-time female lawyer and his wife conspired to smuggle a gun into the Hamburg police headquarters on 29 July 1986, and Pinzner proceeded to kill the attending prosecutor, his wife and himself. The lawyer was sentenced to six years in prison for aiding in murder.

Six persons were murdered in a brothel in Frankfurt am Main in 1994. The Hungarian couple managing the place as well as four Russian prostitutes were strangled with electric cables. The case was resolved soon after: it was a robbery gone bad, carried out by the husband of a woman who had worked there.

In 2012 it was reported that police were investigating the owners of a number of high-class brothels in Düsseldorf. Allegedly, numerous customers had been incapacitated with date rape drugs or other drugs in order to charge exorbitant amounts to their credit cards; those who complained were blackmailed with video footage.

Organized crime
According to Klaus Bayerl, head of the Kriminalpolizei Augsburg, the large brothels created since 2002 are facilities in which official directors are irreproachable persons, while the background, the brothels are run by pimps or criminal gangs and almost always have close ties to organised crime.

Competing for supremacy in the red-light districts include several motorcycle gangs. Again and again there were massive clashes between the Bandidos and the Hells Angels. Both associations are known arms and drug traffickers and promoters of prostitution.

Involved in the fight for control of the red-light districts are the Black Jackets. In 2013, the Lustpark brothel in Neu-Ulm was being used as a weapons warehouse by the Black Jackets. It became known in 2012 that the Dutch gang Satudarah MC were active in Germany. Satudarah is deeply involved in prostitution, drug trafficking and violent crime.

Likewise, the bouncer Gang United Tribuns are involved in the power struggle. The bouncer scene is considered a key position also in recruiting new prostitutes. Other organisations involved in prostitution and trafficking include the Gremium MC, Outlaws MC, the Red Legion, and the Rock Machine MC, whose members are involved in the dispute with the brothel Murat C. in Neu-Ulm in December 2012 when someone was shot.

One of the leading figures in the scene is the German-Turkish Necati Arabaci. He is involved, inter alia, in the brothels Babylon in Elsdorf near Cologne and Wiago in Leverkusen, and also in brothels in Augsburg and Mallorca among others. In 2013 the Augsburg prosecutor established suspicion of money laundering against a person connected to the Hells Angels in the large Colosseum brothel in Augsburg.

The Hanoverian Frank Hanebuth was arrested in July 2013 in Mallorca, Spain, along with 20 other Hells Angels members. As head of the Hells Angels Spanish chapter, he is accused of forming a criminal organisation, promoting illegal prostitution, drug trafficking and money laundering. Hanebuth had acquired several Spanish brothels and is also involved in the mistreatment of prostitutes.

André Schulz, head of the German Criminal Investigation Association warned in July 2016 of ""an escalation of turf wars between enemy biker gangs in Germany"".

Sex trafficking 

Illegal human trafficking is a major focus of police work in Germany, yet it remains prevalent. In 2007, Germany was listed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as a top destination for victims of human trafficking.

In 2009, 710 victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation were discovered, an increase of 5% in comparison with 2008.

In 2008, authorities identified 676 sex-trafficking victims.

In 2007, law enforcement authorities recorded 689 victims trafficked for sexual exploitation. Most victims (419) were between the ages of 18 and 24; 184 were nationals of the country. Approximately 12 percent were under the age of 18, including 39 citizens. One percent (seven) were under 14 years of age.

The trafficking in women from Eastern Europe is often organized by perpetrators from that same region. The German Federal Police Office BKA reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside of Germany.

According to the report, in 2006 about 35% of the victims of human trafficking reported that they had agreed from the beginning to work in prostitution; often they did not know about the working conditions and debts incurred. Some others hoped for a job as waitress, maid or au pair; some were simply abducted. Once in Germany, their passports are sometimes taken away and they are informed that they now have to work off the cost of the trip. Sometimes they are brokered to pimps or brothel operators, who then make them work off the purchase price. They work in brothels, bars, apartments; as streetwalkers or as escorts and have to hand over the better part of their earnings. Some women reconcile themselves with this situation as they still make much more money than they could at home; others rebel and are threatened or abused. They are, reportedly, sometimes told that the police have been paid off and will not help them, which is false. They are, reportedly, also threatened with harm to their families at home.

The report states that victims are often unwilling to testify against their oppressors: the only incentive they have to do so is the permission to remain in the country until the end of the trial (with the hope of finding a husband during that time), rather than being deported immediately. Prostitutes from EU countries are not prohibited from traveling to and working in Germany. There is a large influx from Poland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Romania, for instance. Actually, the income prospects for them are not larger than at home, but they prefer to work in the better and safer German environment, as long as they can avoid pimps exploiting and controlling them. German law enforcement aggressively tries to eradicate pimping. In one raid in 2013 near Bonn, 24 males were arrested for exploiting prostitutes, one of them just 15 years old.

Scandals and news coverage 

In 2003, German CDU politician Michel Friedman, popular TV talk show host and then assistant chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, became embroiled in an investigation of trafficking women. He had been a client of several escort prostitutes from Eastern Europe who testified that he had repeatedly taken and offered cocaine. After receiving a fine for the drug charge, he resigned from all posts. Since 2004 he has been hosting a weekly talk show on the TV channel N24.

Also in 2003, artist and art professor Jörg Immendorff was caught in the luxury suite of a Düsseldorf hotel with seven prostitutes (and four more on their way) and some cocaine. He admitted to having staged several such orgies and received 11 months on probation and a fine for the drug charges. He attempted to explain his actions by his ""orientalism"" and terminal illness.

In 2012, Bettina Wulff, the ex-wife of German ex-president Christian Wulff, won several court settlements with some media outlets and the search engine Google requiring them to not connect her with an alleged past as a prostitute.

Politics 
The coalition of Social Democrats and the Green Party that governed the country from 1998 until late 2005 attempted to improve the legal situation of prostitutes in the years 2000–2003. These efforts were criticized as inadequate by prostitutes' organizations such as Hydra, which lobby for full normality of the occupation and the elimination of all mention of prostitution from the legal code. The conservative parties in the Bundestag, while supporting the goal of improving prostitutes' access to the social security and health care system, have opposed the new law because they want to retain the ""offending good morals"" status.

German churches run several support groups for prostitutes. These generally favor attempts to remove stigmatization and improve the legal situation of prostitutes, but they retain the long term abolitionist goal of a world without prostitution and encourage all prostitutes to leave the occupation.

Alice Schwarzer rejects all prostitution as inherently oppressive and abusive; she favors a legal arrangement similar to the situation in Sweden, wherein 1999 after heavy feminist lobbying a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and leftists outlawed the buying but not the selling of sexual services. German-American journalist and men's rights activist Jerry Hoss likens the push for prostitution prohibition to a demand for a ""final solution of the prostitution problem by Feminazis."" He asserts that pimping, forced labor, abduction, false imprisonment, illegal immigration, extortion, rape, bodily injury, etc. are already strictly forbidden in Germany and no new laws are needed, just better enforcement.

In 2005, the ruling grand coalition of CDU and SPD announced plans to punish customers of forced prostitutes, if the customer could reasonably have been aware of the situation. In April 2009, it was reported that the plans would provide for a penalty of up to 5 years in prison. The law had not been enacted when the center-right CDU-FDP coalition came to power in November 2009. In 2014, the coalition of CDU and SPD renewed their plans to increase regulation and control of prostitution. Several organisations protested against these plans, amongst them prostitutes organisations as Hydra, Doña Carmen, the 'Berufsverband erotische und sexuelle Dienstleistungen', and an anonymous group of customers, the Freieroffensive. In 2016 and 2017 many of the proposals were brought into law.

135,1282402,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid%20to%20Families%20with%20Dependent%20Children,Aid to Families with Dependent Children,"Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) was a federal assistance program in the United States in effect from 1935 to 1997, created by the Social Security Act (SSA) and administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provided financial assistance to children whose families had low or no income.

The program grew from a minor part of the social security system to a significant system of welfare administered by the states with federal funding. However, it was criticized for offering incentives for women to have children, and for providing disincentives for women to join the workforce. In July 1997, AFDC was replaced by the more restrictive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.

History

The program was created under the name Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) by the Social Security Act of 1935 as part of the New Deal. It was created as a means tested entitlement which subsidized the income of families where fathers were ""deceased, absent, or unable to work"". It provided a direct payment of $18 per month for one child, and $12 for a second child. In 1994, the average payment was $420/month.

The federal government required contributions from individual states, and authorized state discretion to determine who received aid and in what amount. ADC was primarily created for white single mothers, who were expected not to work. Black mothers, who had always been in the labor force, were not considered eligible to receive benefits. In 1961 a change in the law permitted states to extend benefits to families where the father was unemployed, a measure which 25 states eventually adopted. The words ""families with"" were added to the name in 1962, partly due to concern that the program's rules discouraged marriage.

The Civil Rights Movement and the efforts of the National Welfare Rights Organization in the 1960s expanded the scope of welfare entitlements to include black women. The welfare rolls racial demographics changed drastically. The majority of welfare recipients still remained white and most black female recipients continued to work. Starting in 1962, the Department of Health and Human Services allowed state-specific exemptions as long as the change was ""in the spirit of AFDC"" in order to allow some experimentation. By 1996 spending was $24 billion per year. When adjusted for inflation, the highest spending was in 1976, which exceeded 1996 spending by about 8%. In 1967 the federal government began requiring states to establish the paternity of children eligible for the program, and extended benefits to ""unemployed male parents with a work history"".

Man-in-the-house rule
A number of states enacted so called ""man-in-the-house"" rules, which disqualified families if there was any adult male present in the household whatsoever. As Williams and Hardisty phrased it:

States had wide discretion to determine eligibility and many states conditioned the receipt of welfare on the sexual morality of the mother, using ""suitable home"" and ""man in the house"" rules to disqualify many African American single mothers.

The ""man-in-the-house"" rule was struck down in 1968 by the Supreme Court in King v. Smith. Thereafter, families with males in the household were eligible for benefits if they were not deemed to be actual or substitute parents, although any financial contribution on the part of the male to the family was still considered a part of the family's total income. By 1981, the Supreme Court went further and required that states take into consideration the income earned by step-fathers.

Thirty-and-a-third rule

The year 1967 saw the establishment of the thirty-and-a-third rule, which allowed families to keep their first $30 earned along with one third of their income following the first $30 without the change affecting their eligibility for benefits. This and other factors led to a large increase in enrollment. For example, caseloads rose 24% from 1960 to 1965, but rose 126% in the period from 1965 to 1970.

Criticism

Early in the program, there were concerns about whether it encouraged unwed motherhood. Some advocates complained that the rule had the effect of breaking up marriages and promoting matriarchy:

[T]he AFDC program tended to treat households with a cohabiting male who was not the natural father of the children much more leniently than those with a resident spouse or father of the children. This feature created a clear disincentive for marriage and also a clear incentive for divorce, because women who married face the reduction or loss of their AFDC benefits.

In 1984, libertarian author Charles Murray, author of The Bell Curve, suggested that welfare causes dependency. He argued that as welfare benefits increased, the number of recipients also increased; this behavior, he said, was rational: there is little reason to work if one can receive benefits for a long period of time without having to work. His later work and that of Richard J. Herrnstein and others suggested possible merit to the theory of a dysgenic effect, however, the data are not entirely clear.

One economist was unable to find convincing evidence that welfare programs have a strong effect on the dissolution of marriages.  But right or wrong, this argument was among the stepping stones leading to the modification of AFDC toward TANF.

Termination
In 1996, President Bill Clinton negotiated with the Republican-controlled Congress to pass the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which drastically restructured the program. Among other changes, a lifetime limit of five years was imposed on the receipt of benefits; the newly limited nature of the replacement program was reinforced by calling AFDC's successor Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Many Americans continue to refer to TANF as ""welfare"" or AFDC.

TANF has remained controversial. In 2003, LaShawn Y. Warren, an ACLU Legislative Counsel, said that TANF gives states an incentive ""to deny benefits to those who need it most. The solution to getting people out of the cycle of poverty is not to prematurely kick them off welfare. Too many have been denied aid unfairly, creating a false impression that the number of people who need help has decreased."" In 2006, a New Republic editorial wrote, ""A broad consensus now holds that welfare reform was certainly not a disaster—and that it may, in fact, have worked much as its designers had hoped.""

The exact location of Hubushkia is unknown. The kingdom appears in the Assyrian annals of the tenth and ninth centuries B.C., which record the names of some kings of Hubushkia, such as Kaki and Data or Dadi. The Assyrian references primarily record the relations between the Assyrian Empire and Hubushkia towards the end of the ninth century. Assyrian expeditions crossed Hubushkia several times, receiving tribute from its kings, or taking it by force when they resisted. Disputed by Assyria and the kingdom of Urartu, Hubushkia eventually lost its independence. A position between these contending forces suggests to some scholars that the kingdom of Hubushkia was centred on the headwaters of the Great Zap River, in what is now Hakkâri Province in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey.

The descendants and heirs of the kingdom of Hubushkia were Armenian naxarardoms (principalities) Moks (Mokk, Mogk, Moxoene) and Andzevatsik.

It takes a file in Unix mbox format and generates an HTML archive, complete with an index and various sorting options. It is commonly used for creating mailing list archives, but it can archive any collection of emails. Originally written in 1994 by Tom Gruber using Common Lisp, it was rewritten in C by Kevin Hughes for its initial public release in 1994.

The mbox format is used by several email clients on various platforms, including most Unix and Linux ones. Popular examples of email clients that use the mbox format (and as such are compatible with Hypermail) include Kmail, pine and Mozilla Thunderbird.

Hypermail is operated at the command-line. It was originally intended for use in Unix-like platforms such as Linux. However, it is also possible to use the program in Microsoft Windows by compiling it with MinGW, or by using the Cygwin library.

Building for Windows

It is possible to compile Hypermail as a fully native Windows program by using MinGW. However, certain modifications need to be made to the program's source code. Building Hypermail for Windows using MinGW, by Israel G. Lugo, provides a patch to apply these modifications, as well as step by step instructions on how to accomplish the whole process and some usage examples.

Instructions are also available for creating the executable using Cygwin. Building HYPERMAIL on WIN32 with CYGWIN, by Bob Crispen, guides the user through the steps required, and offers a usage example as well.

Elizabeth was the only daughter of Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, a younger son of the Hungarian king Charles I, and member of the Hungarian branch of the Capetian House of Anjou. Her mother was Margaret of Bavaria, and her only known sibling John, Duke of Slavonia (1354–1360). Elizabeth was regarded as heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary after the death of her brother, as her uncle Louis I had no children. Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, wanted her to marry his eldest son, Wenceslaus. However, the marriage negotiations were ended in 1370, when a daughter named Catherine was born to Elizabeth's uncle. Catherine was followed by two sisters, which meant that Elizabeth would not inherit the Holy Crown of Hungary.

In October 1370, Elizabeth married Philip II, Prince of Taranto, a 41-year-old widower and pretender to the Latin Empire. Philip had survived his children by his previous marriage and was in need of heirs. As her dower, Elizabeth was granted Corfu as a personal fief. Their only known child, a son named Philip, was born in 1371 and died the same year. Elizabeth was widowed on 25 November 1374. She appears to have died before the end of the 1380s.

142,8751548,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplae%20district,Laplae district,"Laplae or Lablae (, ) is a district (amphoe) in the western part of Uttaradit province, northern Thailand.

History
In the past, the district office of Laplae was in Mueang Thung Yang. Later it was moved to Mon Cham Sin (), about 1 km north of the present location. As the location of the office was inconvenient to reach, Luang Si Phanon Mat ordered to move the district office to Mon Sayammin (). At the same time, King Chulalongkorn visited Laplae and chose Mon Cham Sin as the location of the Buddha statue named Phra Luea (). This statue was made from the gold left after completion of the Buddha statue called Phra Phuttha Chinnarat in neighboring Phitsanulok.

Legend of Laplae
Laplae means 'hidden from sight'. One guess as to the origin of the name is that the path to get there is so obscure that the uninitiated get lost. Another idea is that in ancient times the people of the cities of Nan and Phrae would seek refuge in the densely forested valleys of Laplae in times of war. The local people believe that only a good man can reach Laplae.

There is a story that has been passed down known as ""the legend of Laplae"". It tells that once upon a time, there was a man who saw two beautiful women walking out from Laplae carrying leaves. The women proceeded to hide these leaves. The man was curious so he took one of the leaves. In the afternoon, one of the women came back and couldn't find her leaf. The man then appeared before her and offered her a trade: she had to take the man to Laplae with her if he gave her the leaf. She accepted and led the man to Laplae. 
Then the man noticed that in Laplae there were only women. The woman explained that in Laplae there is a rule that no one is allowed to lie and that the men couldn't keep their word and only the women could.

Time passed by and the man and woman fell in love with each other and they married and had a child. One day, the woman went outside and the baby cried so the man lied to it and said that his mother was coming back. The mother came back and heard the man lie so he needed to leave Laplae. Before the man left Laplae, the woman prepared filled a bag with food and turmeric roots for him to take back to his own village. The man took the bag but during his journey it became very heavy so he threw out some of the turmeric roots. When he arrived home he found that the one remaining turmeric had turned into gold. He was very surprised so he ran back to where he had thrown away the rest but these had changed back into ordinary turmeric roots. He tried to return to Laplae but he couldn't find it so he went back to his own village.

Geography
Neighboring districts are (from the east clockwise) Mueang Uttaradit, Tron of Uttaradit Province, Si Satchanalai of Sukhothai province and Den Chai of Phrae province

Economy
Approximately 27,000 rai, 43 km2, of Laplae district is cultivated in durians, making it the biggest durian producer in northern Thailand.

Handwoven cotton from Laplae, using natural dyes, are a five-star OTOP product.

Administration
The district is divided into eight sub-districts (tambon), which are further subdivided into 63 villages (muban). There are three townships (thesaban tambon): Si Phanom Mat covers tambon Si Phanom Mat, Hua Dong parts of tambon Mae Phun, and Thung Yang parts of the tambon Thung Yang and Phai Lom. There are a further seven tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

Festivals

 The Atthami Bucha Festival Laplae is held each year a week after Vesak at Wat Phra Borom That Thung Yang to commemorate the cremation of the Buddha.
 The Durian Festival is held each year around the beginning of June.

143,34208889,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga%20%28Buddhism%29,Raga (Buddhism),"Raga (Sanskrit, also ; Pali ; Tibetan:  ) is a Buddhist concept of character affliction or poison referring to any form of ""greed, sensuality, lust, desire"" or ""attachment to a sensory object"". Raga is represented in the Buddhist artwork (bhāvacakra) as the bird or rooster. Raga (lobha) is identified in the following contexts within the Buddhist teachings:
 One of the three poisons within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition
 One of the three unwholesome roots within the Theravada Buddhist tradition
 One of the six root kleshas within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings
 One of the fourteen unwholesome mental factors within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings

Definitions
 literally means 'color or hue' in Sanskrit, but appears in Buddhist texts as a form of blemish, personal impurity or fundamental character affliction. As a philosophical concept, the term refers to 'greed, sensuality, desire' or 'attachment to a sensory object'. It includes any form of desire including sexual desire and sensual passion, as well as attachments to, excitement over and pleasure derived from objects of the senses. Some scholars render it as 'craving'.

Raga is one of three poisons and afflictions, also called the ""threefold fires"" in Buddhist Pali canon, that prevents a being from reaching nirvana. To extinguish all raga (greed, lust, desire, attachment) is one of the requirements of nirvana (liberation) in Buddhism.

The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: 
What is craving (raga)? It is attachment to the three realms of existence. Its function consists of engendering suffering.

Raga is said to arise from the identification of the self as being separate from everything else. This mis-perception or misunderstanding is referred to as avidya (ignorance).

The review was intended to guide tax system reforms over the next 10 to 20 years.

Remit
The review was commissioned as one of the specific outcomes from the Australia 2020 Summit held in April 2008.

The review was a ""root and branch"" review, restricted only in that it could not consider increasing the rate or broadening the base of the Goods and Services Tax, imposing tax on superannuation payments to retirees over 60 years of age, or already-announced personal income tax changes.

Panel
The review panel members were:

 Dr Ken Henry (Chair), Secretary to the Treasury
 Dr Jeff Harmer, Secretary, Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs
 Professor John Piggott, Professor of Economics and Associate Dean, Research, Australian School of Business, University of New South Wales
 Ms Heather Ridout, Chief Executive, Australian Industry Group
 Mr Greg Smith, Adjunct Professor, Economic and Social Policy, Australian Catholic University

Recommendations
The report made 138 specific recommendations, grouped under nine broad themes.

 Concentrating revenue raising on four efficient tax bases: personal income, business income, private consumption, and economic rents from natural resources and land.  Other taxes may be retained if they serve a specific policy purpose such as discouraging smoking or traffic congestion.  Taxes fitting into none of these categories should eventually be abolished.
 Configuring taxes and transfers to support productivity, participation and growth.
 An equitable, transparent and simplified personal income tax: a much higher tax-free threshold (around AUD 25,000), only two tax brackets, and a simplification of superannuation, deductions and offsets.
 A fair, adequate, and work supportive transfer system.
 Integrating consumption tax compliance with business systems.
 Efficient land and resource taxation.
 Completing retirement income reform and securing aged care.
 Toward more affordable housing: substantially increase rent assistance, gradually move to a uniform land tax and remove transfer taxes (stamp duty), and gradually move to a neutral treatment of rental and owner-occupied housing.
 A more open, understandable and responsive tax system.

Reception

Rudd government 
Rudd endorsed and implemented only 3 of the 138 recommendations.

The major item from the Henry Review implemented by the Rudd Government was the move to create a resources Super Profit Tax. The proposal was highly controversial, and has been suggested as the main reason why Rudd lost power. Following the his replacement by Julia Gillard as Prime Minister, the proposed tax was replaced by a Mineral Resource Rent Tax. Most of the remaining recommendations were not implemented.

Waterstops are grouped in two distinct categories. Waterstops for joints without any movement of the adjoint concrete sections (construction cold joints) and waterstops for joints with movement of the adjoint concrete sections (dilation joints).

Types 
Waterstops are manufactured from a variety of materials depending on the functionality and their intended use. The most common types are:

 Waterstops made from extruded plastics such as flexible polyvinyl chloride PVC, polyethylene (PE) or thermoplastic vulcanized rubber (TPV); formed metal such as stainless steel, copper, or carbon steel - with or without polymeric coatings; extruded thermosets such as natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, or neoprene rubber.

 Hydrophobic Polymer waterstops such as PVC, PE, TPV, or rubber are supplied to the construction site in coils (usually 25 m long), and are generally anywhere from 120 mm to 320 mm wide in a variety of profiles that are designed to simultaneously provide an interlock with the concrete they are installed in and to provide for a limited amount of movement within the joint. PVC, PE and TPV waterstops are made continuous for the length of the concrete joint by heat welding, using simple thermoplastic welding equipment. PE and TPV waterstops are generally installed in joints of secondary containment structures to prevent the passage of hazardous fluids other than water such as fuel oils, acids, or process chemicals. The German national standards DIN 18541  and DIN 7865  regulate dimensions and material properties of polymeric waterstops.

 Metal waterstops are delivered in coils of up to 50 m with a typical dimension of 1.0 to 1.5 mm thickness and width of 250 to 300 mm. Splices can be welded, overlapped or joined with a sealant. A subcategory of metal waterstops is coated with polymeric and/or hydrophilic materials in order to provide a higher bond to the concrete and form a secondary barrier against waterseapage. These waterstops come in 25 m coils or in 2.0 - 2.5 m sections. Multi-purpose customized waterstops may also function as shuttering or crack-inducer for cold joints.

 Hydrophilic or ""water-loving"" waterstops are strips of rubber, modified with a hydrophilic agent (such as bentonite) so they swell in the presence of moisture to effectively seal concrete construction joints. Hydrophilic strip applied waterstops should not be used in contraction or expansion joints per the instructions of most commercial manufacturers. Hydrophilic waterstops can only be effective if they are allowed to swell; therefore, water must be present to activate the hydrophilic agent. Initial leaking is possible until the waterstop expands to seal the joint. The American Concrete Institute recommends against the use of hydrophilic waterstops for hazardous fluids such as fuels, acids, and process chemicals, as the products may not swell as intended in fluids other than water. Hydrophilic waterstops are also available as moulded plugs and rings to create a seal around formwork spacers, center pens and tie rods.

History

Austin is known for being the site of the 1911 Austin Dam failure which destroyed much of the town and killed 78 people.

The town was rebuilt, under the slogan ""the town too tough to die"". This was later changed to ""the best town by a dam site"".

On November 9, 2021, Kate Crosby, aka Kaitlyn Crosby Wolfel, won the mayoral election against Jim Setzer. They received 38 and 30 votes, respectively. On July 7, 2021, Crosby pleaded guilty for the felony crime of aggravated assault by vehicle on December 21, 2014, which resulted in the death of 62-year-old David Croyle and the maiming of 25-year-old Patrick Hornung. Both men were struck by Crosby’s vehicle while walking along Old West Creek Road, Shippen Township, Cameron County. The Potter Leader-Enterprise wrote that Crosby's felony conviction may render her ineligible to hold office as mayor, because the Pennsylvania Constitution bars anyone convicted of an ""infamous crime"" from holding office in Pennsylvania. Once in office, the DA or attorney general would need to file a quo warranto to remove her.

152,1134344,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department%20of%20Canadian%20Heritage,Department of Canadian Heritage,"The Department of Canadian Heritage, or simply Canadian Heritage (), is the department of the Government of Canada that has roles and responsibilities related to initiatives that promote and support ""Canadian identity and values, cultural development, and heritage.""

The department is administered by the Deputy Minister, currently Hélène Laurendeau, who is appointed by the Governor in Council, and it reports directly to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is currently Pablo Rodríguez.

Under its current mandate, the jurisdiction of Canadian Heritage encompasses, but is not limited to, jurisdiction over: the promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms and related values; multiculturalism; the arts; cultural heritage and industries, including performing arts, visual and audio-visual arts, publishing, sound recording, film, video, and literature; national battlefields; the encouragement, promotion, and development of sport; the advancement of official bilingualism; state ceremonial and Canadian symbols; broadcasting, except in regards to spectrum management and the technical aspects of broadcasting; the development of cultural policy, including such policy as it relates to foreign investment and copyright; the conservation, exportation and importation of cultural property; the organization, sponsorship, and promotion of public activities and events, in the National Capital Region, that will ""enrich the cultural and social fabric of Canada;"" and national museums, archives and libraries.

To fulfill these tasks, the department coordinates a portfolio of several agencies and corporations that operate in a similar area of interest. While the roles and responsibilities of Canadian Heritage have remained relatively constant over the years, the department and composition of its portfolio remain in flux due to continuing structural changes.

History 
Founded on 25 June 1993, the Department of Canadian Heritage was initially created by Kim Campbell from parts of several other federal departments, combining responsibility for official languages, arts and culture, broadcasting, parks, and historic sites, as well as programs in the areas of multiculturalism, citizenship, state ceremonial, amateur sport and the National Capital Commission. In 1994, the Department of Canadian Heritage inherited Parks Canada from Environment Canada, as well as activities that formerly belonged to the Departments of Communications, of Multiculturalism and Citizenship, and of Fitness and Amateur Sport, and the Secretary of State. Since then, Canadian Heritage has gone through several structural and portfolio changes.

In 2003, Canadian Heritage added the Public Service Staff Relations Board (PSRB) to its portfolio, while Parks Canada was returned to the jurisdiction of Environment Canada. Eleven years later, in 2014, the PSRB was removed from the portfolio upon the enactment of the Public Service Labour Relations and Employment Board Act, which established the PSRB as a quasi-judicial tribunal that operates at arm's length from the government.

In late 2008, the multiculturalism section of Canadian Heritage was transferred to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, then transferred back again in November, 2015.

In 2018, the Status of Women secretariat moved out from the umbrella of Canadian Heritage to become its own department.

In 2020, Canadian Heritage introduced established the Federal Anti-Racism Secretariat as part of its national Anti-Racism Strategy.

Department 

The Department of Canadian Heritage is headquartered in the Jules Léger Building (South) () in Terrasses de la Chaudière, Gatineau, Quebec, across the Ottawa River from the Canadian capital of Ottawa.

The department is an umbrella organization that has one of the largest portfolios in the Canadian federal government, and the organizations in the portfolio support the department in the pursuit of its priorities while also striving to achieve their individual mandates.

The departmental framework (as of 2019–20) is:

 Creativity, arts and culture

In addition to coordinating with the organizations in its portfolio, the department also partners with provincial and territorial governments to organize and oversee visits from the Queen of Canada and other members of the royal family.

Structure 
Canadian Heritage is administered by the Deputy Minister, currently Hélène Laurendeau, who is appointed by the Governor in Council. The Deputy Minister is accompanied by an Associate Deputy Minister (currently Isabelle Mondou) and a Deputy Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth and Senior Associate Deputy Minister (currently Gina Wilson).

Activities at the department are overseen by several senior officials, and reports directly to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is currently Steven Guilbeault. Activities related to official languages report to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, currently held by Mélanie Joly; and diversity, inclusion and youth activities report to the Minister of Diversity, Inclusion and Youth, who is currently Bardish Chagger. 

The department is divided into five different areas that each have their own Assistant Deputy Minister:

Programs and budget 
In 2020, the department had a budget of CA$3.89 billion—this is an increase from the $3.66 billion of the previous year, but a minimal decrease from the $3.9 billion budget of 2018.

In the 2019‒20 fiscal year, the total actual spending of Canadian Heritage amounted to $1.55 billion and its total actual full-time equivalents were 1,843.3.

Expenses 
Through its Multiculturalism Programs, in 2019‒20, Canadian Heritage allocated more than $30 million of funding for 116 projects, 372 events, 56 ""Community Support for Black Canadian Youth"" initiatives, a ""National Anti-Black Racism Education and Awareness"" campaign, and 77 ""Community Capacity Building"" initiatives.

In 2019‒20, through its Creative Export Strategy (which is in its 2nd year), Canadian Heritage invested almost $7.2 million in 23 ""export-ready projects"" to support creative entrepreneurs in maximizing their export in the global marketplace. Launched in 2019–20 was the ""Local Journalism Initiative"" with an investment of $50 million over five years, supporting the creation of original civic journalism that covers the multidimensional needs of underserved communities across the country. Partnering with TV5Monde public broadcasters, the Canadian government supported the creation of a French-language digital platform with an investment of $14.6 million over five years, beginning in 2019–20.

In 2019–20, the Celebration and Commemoration Program funded 207 National Indigenous Peoples Day events across Canada, and provided $1.3 million in funding to the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) to organize and host the 2019 APTN Indigenous Day Live in Calgary, AB, Whitehorse, YT, and Winnipeg, MB. (APTN is headquartered in Winnipeg.)

In June 2019, the Department's Legacy Fund supported the centennial anniversary of the Winnipeg general strike, funding a major monument across from Winnipeg's City Hall in the shape of a tipped streetcar, a reference to 21 June 1919, or 'Bloody Saturday'.

Grants and financial support 
Canadian Heritage gives out roughly $1.2 billion in grants annually, available for programs that contribute to the objectives of the department. These departmental objectives include those that relate to supporting culture, history, heritage, sport and Canada's official languages.

In 2019, it was reported that Canadian Heritage provided over $130,000 in public grant money to organizations with ties to the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department, which published ads critical of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests.

The department  requires that application forms be submitted by the deadlines that are specified under the application guidelines of the particular funding program in order to be considered for financial support. A confirmation notice is sent by the department within two weeks of getting an application, and a decision on whether funding will be granted or not is made within thirteen to thirty weeks, depending on the funding program. The first payment is made on or before the fourth week after the Department of Canadian Heritage has sent out a written notice that an application has been approved.

Programs 
In February 2020, the joint Human Rights Program submitted a report to the United Nations, Canada's Interim Report under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, coordinating input between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments.

Also in 2020, Canadian Heritage introduced the national Anti-Racism Strategy, which includes the Anti-Racism Action Program, several new measures, and funding for hundreds of projects to ""foster diversity and inclusion across the country."" The department established the Federal Anti-Racism Secretariat as part of this strategy. Canadian Heritage was additionally given a new mandate to host and support the activities of two secretariats: the LGBTQ2 Secretariat, which promotes the societal contributions of LGBTQ2 communities and ""ensures that [their] rights are protected;"" and the Youth Secretariat, whose activities include ""coordinating meetings of the Prime Minister’s Youth Council and recruiting the next cohort of young people for the Council.""

In 2019, among the various celebrations supported by Canadian Heritage was the 50th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada. Also that year, Sport Canada supported the development of the ""Universal Code of Conduct to Prevent and Address Maltreatment in Sport."" While the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo were postponed (due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Canadian Heritage remained committed to Canadian athletes, high-performance athletes in particular.

153,19043446,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Buster,John Buster,"John Edmond Buster (born July 18, 1941) is an American physician who, while working at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, directed the research team that performed the first embryo transfer from one woman to another resulting in a live birth. It was performed at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, reported in July 1983, and culminated in the announcement of the birth on February 3, 1984. In the procedure, an embryo that was just beginning to develop was transferred from the woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby.

Buster and other members of the UCLA research team were featured in People Magazine, and Time Magazine. Building upon Buster's research, over 200,000 live births resulting from donor embryo transfer have been recorded by the Centers for Disease Control(CDC) in the United States.

Buster continues to practice medicine as a reproductive endocrinologist at Women and Infants' Fertility Center in Providence, Rhode Island.

Education 
Buster attended Stanford University for his undergraduate degree and earned both his medical degree and residency training in obstetrics and gynecology from the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, where he later completed fellowship training in reproductive endocrinology and infertility.

Career
Buster works in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island.  He is also engaged in private practice and in clinical teaching of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the Women & Infants/Alpert Medical School (Brown University) fellowship in reproductive endocrinology and infertility.

Research
Buster's research and clinical practice in reproductive medicine include published studies in steroid physiology, pre-implantation embryology, pregnancy loss, and menopausal hormone replacement therapy.

Buster authored ""Sex and the 50-Something Woman: Strategies for Restoring Satisfaction"" in the journal Contemporary Obstetrics and Gynecology. The intent was to explain the various causes of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and the simple interventions obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care physicians can recommend. The article attracted national interest with stories appearing in local media.

One of Buster's earliest research studies focused on steroid hormone radioimmunoassay (RIA). He reported an RIA for the androgen prohormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), the direct measurement of which was shown to be possible in un-extracted serum. Refined versions of his methodology are used in the diagnosis and management of androgen excess disorders in women. He also described for the first time the simultaneous progression of multiple androgen, progestin, and estrogen concentrations in maternal blood throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy and into the onset of labor.

Buster helped develop a testosterone delivery system for women researched by Procter & Gamble. It is  marketed in Europe under the brand name Intrinsa. Buster served as lead investigator in another study demonstrating the effectiveness of an estradiol mist, which has pharmacology similar to those of a trans-dermal estrogen patches. Sold in the United States by Perrigo under the name Evamist, it received FDA approval in 2007. Buster's Phase III Study for Evamist was published in the journal, Obstetrics & Gynecology.

In the early 1980s, over a period of 4 years, at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, Buster and his team developed a technique based on in vivo fertilization and uterine lavage – a method adapted from the commercialization of bovine embryo transfer in the cattle industry – as a means to transfer human blastocysts from fertile woman donors to ovulating or agonadal infertile recipient women.  In February 1984, the first live birth, followed 3 months later by a second live birth, resulted from these techniques and was reported by Buster and his team.

Buster updated the uterine lavage technology adapting it to diagnosis and prevention of genetic diseases in embryos. In 2011 Buster founded Previvo Genetics, Inc. He serves on the Board of Directors and Scientific Board.

In April 2019 at the International Federation of Fertility Societies (IFFS)World Congress in Shanghai, China, Buster presented the preliminary results from the first Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) using in vivo Embryos recovered by Uterine Lavage.

In January, 2020, Buster with the Previvo research team reported the first large series (134 hyper stimulation/lavage cycles) describing the successful and safe recovery of 136 in vivo fertilized and matured embryos using in vivo uterine lavage (IVL). 
For controls, 20 of the lavage subjects also underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF).   Most significantly the morphology scores of the IVL blastocysts were significantly higher than the IVF controls.

Awards and honors
Buster received the Legends Award in May 2012 from LA BioMed located at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

In June 2014 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) awarded a permanently endowed lectureship, the John E. Buster, M.D. lectureship on cutting edge reproductive medicine.  This lecture is given annually.

Robbins (August 9, 1885 – July 30, 1962) was an American athlete and a member of the Irish American Athletic Club. He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1908 he was involved in a controversial race in the final of the Men's 400 metres and was later part of a team which broke the world's record for the one mile relay.

1908 Summer Olympics
Robbins advanced to the finals in the 400 metres race at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning his preliminary heat with a time of 50.4 seconds and his semifinal in 49.0 seconds.  In the first running of the final race, Robbins finished in front.  However, teammate John Carpenter was disqualified after being accused of obstructing British runner Wyndham Halswelle and the race was ordered to be repeated without Carpenter. Robbins and fellow American John Taylor refused to compete in the second final in protest of Carpenter's disqualification. Halswelle ran the race alone, and was presented with the Gold medal. This race is the only case of a walkover in Olympic history.

According to Robbins' 1910 trading card, he was ""one of the best quarter-milers in the United States. He was... (a) Cornell University student, and first came to prominence by the part he played in the 400-meter race held at London in 1908. 'Yank,' as he (was) called by his team mates, ran the first 300 yards at such a clip that it 'pulled the great Halswell's cork,' the later finishing in third place. Robbins won the Metropolitan Amateur Athletic Union quarter-mile championship in September, 1909, and two weeks later captured the Canadian quarter-mile title, running the distance in the great time of 48 4/5 seconds.""

1 Mile Relay World's Record
At the Amateur Athletic Union metropolitan championships held at Travers Island in 1909,  Robbins was part of the Irish American Athletic Club's four-man relay team that broke the world's record for the one mile relay, with a time of 3 minutes 20 2/5 seconds. The other three men on the record breaking team were; C.S. Cassara, James Rosenberger and Melvin Sheppard.

161,903100,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20Route%20550,U.S. Route 550,"U.S. Route 550 (US 550) is a spur of U.S. Highway 50 that runs from Bernalillo, New Mexico to Montrose, Colorado in the western United States. The section from Silverton to Ouray is frequently called the Million Dollar Highway.
It is one of the roads on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.

Route description

New Mexico 

U.S. 550 begins just north of Albuquerque at Bernalillo and passes through the towns of San Ysidro, Cuba, Bloomfield, and Aztec.  Except for sections passing through the above listed towns, U.S. 550 in New Mexico has been upgraded to four lanes, offering a high-speed (70 mph) connection for Farmington, New Mexico and Durango, Colorado to Albuquerque and Santa Fe.

Colorado 
Most of U.S. 550 in Colorado is two-lane mountainous highway.  It is one of only two  north–south U.S. Highways in Colorado which runs west of the Continental Divide. (The other route is US 491.) The route travels north through the San Juan Mountains.

The Million Dollar Highway stretches for about  in western Colorado and follows the route of U.S. 550 between Silverton and Ouray, Colorado. It is part of the San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway. Between Durango and Silverton the Skyway loosely parallels the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad.

Though the entire stretch has been called the Million Dollar Highway, it is really the twelve miles (19 km) south of Ouray through the Uncompahgre Gorge to the summit of Red Mountain Pass which gains the highway its name.  This stretch through the gorge is challenging and potentially hazardous to drive; it is characterized by steep cliffs, narrow lanes, and a lack of guardrails; the ascent of Red Mountain Pass is marked with a number of hairpin curves used to gain elevation, and again, narrow lanes for traffic—many cut directly into the sides of mountains.  During this ascent, the remains of the Idarado Mine are visible. Travel north from Silverton to Ouray allows drivers to hug the inside of curves; travel south from Ouray to Silverton perches drivers on the vertiginous outside edge of the highway. Large RVs travel in both directions, which adds a degree of excitement (or danger) to people in cars.  The road is kept open year-round.  Summer temperatures can range from highs between  at the ends of the highway to  in the mountain passes.  The snow season starts in October, and snow will often close the road in winter.  Chains may be required to drive.

North of Durango, the highway passes by Trimble Springs, hot springs that have been open for visitors since the late 19th century.  The highway runs north along the Animas River, under the Hermosa Cliffs.  It enters the San Juan National Forest and goes past Haviland Lake and Electra Lake.  Drivers pass by Engineer Mountain and Twilight Peak before crossing Coal Bank Pass.  Next is Molas Pass, which offers a panoramic view of Molas Lake, the Animas River Gorge, and Snowdon Peak.  Northbound travelers then pass through the town of Silverton, elevation 9,320 feet (2841 m), surrounded by 13,000 foot (4000 m) peaks Sultan Mountain, Kendall Mountain, and Storm Peak.

The highway leaves Silverton and proceeds up Mineral Creek Valley before ascending to Red Mountain Pass.  The ruins of the Longfellow Mine are visible along the way. The highway then goes through a series of steep grades and hairpin turns before reaching Lookout Point, which offers a view of the town of Ouray.

This section of the route passes over three mountain passes:
 Coal Bank Pass, elevation .
 Molas Pass, elevation .
 Red Mountain Pass, elevation .

The origin of the name Million Dollar Highway is disputed.  There are several legends, though, including that it cost a million dollars a mile to build in the 1920s, and that its fill dirt contains a million dollars in gold ore.

There are seventy named avalanche paths that intersect Highway 550 in the  between Ouray and Silverton, Colorado.

U.S. 550 ends at the corner of Townsend Avenue and San Juan Avenue in Montrose, Colorado at the junction of its parent route U.S. Highway 50.

History 

The original portion of the Million Dollar Highway was a toll road built by Otto Mears in 1883 to connect
Ouray and Ironton.
Another toll road was built over Red Mountain Pass from Ironton to Silverton.
In the late 1880s Otto Mears turned to building railroads and built the Silverton Railroad north from
Silverton over Red Mountain Pass to reach the lucrative mining districts around
Red Mountain, terminating at Albany just eight miles (13 km) south of Ouray.
The remaining eight miles (13 km) were considered too difficult and steep for a railroad.
At one point a cog railroad was proposed, but it never made it beyond the planning stage.

In the early 1920s, the original toll road was rebuilt at considerable cost and became the present day US 550. The Million Dollar Highway was completed in 1924.
Today the entire route is part of the San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway.

US 550 was part of the original 1926 federal highway system. The original highway extended 110 miles (177 km) from Montrose, Colorado at U.S. Highway 50 to U.S. Highway 450 (now U.S. Highway 160) at Durango, Colorado. In 1934, Highway 550 was extended through Farmington to Shiprock, New Mexico. In 1989, the western end of US 550 was replaced with US 64 between Farmington and Shiprock. In 2000, US 550 was extended further south from Aztec to Bernalillo to replace the newly upgraded NM 44 and NM 544, at which time all of US 550 in New Mexico was four lanes.

In 2009 US 50 was re-routed onto the San Juan Avenue bypass to avoid downtown Montrose. As a result, U.S. 550 was extended approximately one mile northwest to intersect with the new U.S. 50 alignment.

162,25935211,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20Absalom%20Thom,Robert Absalom Thom,"Robert Absalom Thom (14 June 1873 – 2 November 1955) was the final Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent of the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway, and became a key figure in the locomotive departments of the company's successors, the Great Central Railway and the London & North Eastern Railway. Thom was born at Aberdeen on 14 June 1873. He attended Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen, where he received a technical education.

Career

Early years
He was apprenticed in 1888 to the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) at their locomotive works at Kittybrewster, just outside Aberdeen. On completion of his apprenticeship in 1893, he became an inspector and then deputy works foreman. He left the GNoSR in 1898, moving to the Neasden works of the Metropolitan Railway, where he was foreman; but he did not stay long, moving to join Thomas Beeley & Sons at Hyde Junction, east of Manchester, as works foreman.

Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway
On 24 October 1902, he became the Locomotive Inspector of the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway (LDECR), at their Tuxford locomotive works; the post was later renamed Locomotive Superintendent, and in mid 1906 his yearly salary was £350.

Great Central Railway
The LDECR was absorbed by the Great Central Railway (GCR) at the start of 1907, and he transferred to the GCR's Gorton locomotive works to work as Assistant to the locomotive superintendent John G. Robinson.

London and North Eastern Railway
At the start of 1923, the GCR became a constituent of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER), and in the new organisation he was appointed District Mechanical Engineer for the former GC section. One of his tasks was to produce a scheme for the renumbering of the former GCR and GNoSR locomotives within the block of LNER numbers which ran from 5000 to 6999. In this he was assisted by Thomas E. Heywood, the former Locomotive Superintendent of the GNoSR, who was now Mechanical Engineer and Locomotive Running Superintendent, LNER (Northern Scottish Area). The GCR locos took numbers between 5001 and 6494, and the scheme adopted for the GNoSR locomotives was that 6800 should be added to the former GNoSR numbers.

The LNER was a very devolved organisation. At the very top level, there were officers whose duties covered the LNER as a whole - such as Nigel Gresley, who was Chief Mechanical Engineer of the LNER (and based at ) - but below this, matters were dealt with on a very much more local basis. The LNER was divided into areas and sections, each of which corresponded with one or two of the larger pre-grouping companies. Each of these had its own Area Mechanical Engineer, or equivalent post, whose headquarters was at one of the main workshops, such as Cowlairs or Doncaster.

In 1924, Thom became Mechanical Engineer of the LNER's Scottish Area, and in 1927 became Mechanical Engineer, Doncaster. In both of these promotions, his replacement was Thomas Heywood, mentioned earlier in connection with the renumbering. From 1 January 1934 Thom's duties expanded when his post was combined with that of Mechanical Engineer, Stratford, becoming Mechanical Engineer for the Southern Area of the LNER. He retired in 1938, and his former post was then split again: the new Mechanical Engineer, Doncaster was Edward Thompson, whilst F.W. Carr became Mechanical Engineer, Stratford.

Locomotive design
Thom was responsible for only one new design of locomotive, the large Class D 0-6-4T, nine of which were built between March 1904 and December 1906 for use on the coal trains which ran from the coalfield in northern Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to the docks at Grimsby and Immingham. These became LNER class M1, and were withdrawn between 1939 and 1947. They were direct predecessors of the GCR Class 1B 2-6-4T introduced in 1914, upon which Thom assisted Robinson with the design work.

Death
He died at Ilkley on 2 November 1955.

163,13450357,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiring%20party,Wiring party,"Wiring parties, (or wiring sappers, cutters), were used during World War I on the Western Front as an offensive countermeasure against the enemy’s barbed wire obstacles. Though hazardous and stressful duty, work was done at night to repair, improve, and rebuild their own wire defences, while also sabotaging and cutting the enemy's. In battles all across the Western Front, cutting parties were successful in creating breaches in the wire lines, offering their comrades a better chance to cross no man's land.

Barbed wire was one of the attacker's great problems. There were cutters, but not enough, and men were often killed before they could cut a way.

New technology
The outbreak of World War I led to a revolution in modern warfare, and the use of barbed wire on the battlefield was one of the many technologies relied upon to hamper the enemy's attack. Used by American cattle ranchers since the 1870s, barbed wire was adapted on the Western Front to serve a more gruesome purpose than containing livestock. Transformed into a weapon of war, it was shaped to create deadly obstacles in the path of assaulting enemy troops. Meant to trap, maim, and make easy targets of the opponent, they ranged from a single strand of wire arranged to trip men in the dark, to a 150-metre-long construction  and  tall By spring of 1915, barbed wire entanglements were an unavoidable element in trench warfare, and posed a serious threat to all men going 'over the top'.

The call of duty
The integration of barbed wire as an instrument of war required the formation of tactical teams, or wiring parties. Barbed wire defences needed to be maintained frequently, as shrapnel often cut the wire, or the enemy had sabotaged it during battle or the night before. Workers did not just deal with the actual wire; they also had to clear the entanglements of any bodies or body parts.
Under the cover of darkness, often one-third of units stealthily climbed out of the trenches to perform maintenance on their wires, as well as investigating the status of the enemy's. They were charged with the task of repairing damaged wire and reconstructing the line if necessary. In addition, these working parties attempted to cut and destroy the enemy’s wire in the hopes of preventing their troops from being stopped in the middle of no man's land during the next attack. From as early as 9pm and as late as 3am, they were like ""so many animals, working during the night and sleeping by day"". As the war progressed, it seemed to become 'regular routine', but often one of the most deadly and difficult duties to perform.

Equipment and methods

Due to the extreme dangers inherent with no man's land, specialized tools and methods were implemented to make the process quieter and more effective. Pickets, or metal posts, were originally used to hold up the wire and were hammered in by a muffled mallet. However, this still produced noise, rendering the sappers targets. Therefore, screw pickets or 'cork-screws' were produced. These looped steel posts had a drill-like end, allowing it to be twisted into the ground noiselessly and the wire then wrapped around it.

The wiring parties began by creeping into no man's land carrying all their equipment, including the  screw-pickets and rolls of sharp barbed wire. Often this was a painful task in itself:

You mention in your letter about what I would like or need most ... However, I'm not complaining or asking for anything so don't worry about me. A good stout pair of gloves for handling barbed wire or fur gloves (lined) would be acceptable. (Lt. Cecil Louis' letter to his wife, 1916)

Erecting wire was time consuming and meticulous; sappers had to first repair wire by hand, then construct new defences if needed. Destroying wire, on the other hand, could be done either by going through, over, or under the wire, and could be done by hand or by using wire-cutting shells and mortars.
The object of the wiring parties was to slow down the enemy’s attack, while speeding up their own. For this reason, workers attempted to make it impossible for the enemy to get to their trench, while sabotaging the enemy’s wire for their own benefit. In addition, though the distance between trenches varied between 7 and 500 yards, workers tried to erect barbed wire defences as far away from their trench as possible, to prevent the enemy from getting too close to the trench, or possibly lobbing in grenades.

Dangers
Working with barbed wire was a nasty job under any circumstances, but when you were handling it in the dark and within a hundred yards of rifles and machine guns that would shoot at the least sound, you were doing one of the most nerve-wracking bits of work that could possibly be imagined...the slightest move might mean death for half your party.

Wiring parties faced the constant danger of being noticed by enemy searchlights or troops. Enemy sentries were trained to listen and look for these nighttime raiders, and any suspicious sounds or movements could give away the men's position and consequently bring a concentration of heavy fire that way. Unprotected and often standing, wiring parties were subject to enemy flares which would expose them immediately, causing them to have to lie flat, even on the very wire they were carrying.

To conceal themselves as much as possible, party members left extra supplies in the trench, and only ventured out at night.  The teams scrambled to work as quickly and silently as possible, as such stressful night work and physical labour promoted fatigue and little time to sleep. Also, returning to one's trench in the middle of the night proved tricky, as workers often got lost on their way back. Finally, wiring parties were always wary of the enemy's parties, as they performed the same task each night.

Popular culture
A wiring party is described in detail in the World War I novel All Quiet on the Western Front by E.M. Remarque, as well as the 1930 film based on it.  Paul Baumer, the main character, has one of his first experiences of front line duty in a nighttime wiring party.  Part way through the work, they are shelled and one of his comrades is killed, the first of many of his friends to die in combat.

World War I"
164,65239267,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu%20languages,Ainu languages,"The Ainu languages ( ), sometimes also known as Ainuic, are a small language family, often portrayed as a language isolate, historically spoken by the Ainu people of northern Japan and neighboring islands.

The primary varieties of Ainu are alternately considered a group of closely related languages or divergent dialects of a single language isolate. The only surviving variety is Hokkaido Ainu, which UNESCO lists as critically endangered. Sakhalin Ainu and Kuril Ainu are now extinct. Toponymic evidence suggests Ainu was once spoken in northern Honshu. No genealogical relationship between Ainu and any other language family has been demonstrated, despite numerous attempts.

Varieties
Recognition of the different varieties of Ainu spoken throughout northern Japan and its surrounding islands in academia varies.  (1990:9) and  (1998:2) both speak of ""Ainu languages"" when comparing the varieties of language spoken in Hokkaidō and Sakhalin; however,  speaks only of ""dialects"". Refsing (1986) says Hokkaidō and Sakhalin Ainu were not mutually intelligible.  (1964) considered Ainu data from 19 regions of Hokkaidō and Sakhalin, and found the primary division to lie between the two islands.

Kuril Ainu
Data on Kuril Ainu is scarce, but it is thought to have been as divergent as Sakhalin and Hokkaidō.

Sakhalin Ainu
In Sakhalin Ainu, an eastern coastal dialect of Taraika (near modern Gastello (Poronaysk)) was quite divergent from the other localities. The Raychishka dialect, on the western coast near modern Uglegorsk, is the best documented and has a dedicated grammatical description. Take Asai, the last speaker of Sakhalin Ainu, died in 1994. The Sakhalin Ainu dialects had long vowels and a final -h phoneme, which they pronounced as /x/.

Hokkaidō Ainu
Hokkaidō Ainu clustered into several dialects with substantial differences between them: the 'neck' of the island (Oshima County, data from  and ); the ""classical"" Ainu of central Hokkaidō around  and the southern coast ( and  counties, data from  and ; historical records from Ishikari County and Sapporo show that these were similar);  (on the southeastern cape in , but perhaps closest to the northeastern dialect); the northeast (data from  and ); the north-central dialect (Kamikawa County, data from  and ) and  (on the northwestern cape), which was closest of all Hokkaidō varieties to Sakhalin Ainu. Most texts and grammatical descriptions we have of Ainu cover the Central Hokkaidō dialect.

Scant data from Western voyages at the turn of the 19th–20th century ( 2000) suggest there was also great diversity in northern Sakhalin, which was not sampled by .

Classification
Vovin (1993) splits Ainu ""dialects"" as follows (Vovin 1993:157):

Proto-Ainu
Proto-Hokkaido–Kuril
Hokkaido dialects
Kuril dialects
Proto-Sakhalin
Sakhalin dialects

External relationships
No genealogical relationship between Ainu and any other language family has been demonstrated, despite numerous attempts. Thus, it is a language isolate. Ainu is sometimes grouped with the Paleosiberian languages, but this is only a geographic blanket term for several unrelated language families that were present in Siberia before the advances of Turkic and Tungusic languages there.

A study by Lee and  of Waseda University found evidence that the Ainu language and the early Ainu-speakers originated from the Northeast Asian/Okhotsk population, which established themselves in northern Hokkaido and expanded into large parts of Honshu and the Kurils.

The Ainu languages share a noteworthy amount of vocabulary (especially fish names) with several Northeast Asian languages, including Nivkh, Tungusic, Mongolic, and Chukotko-Kamchatkan. While linguistic evidence point to an origin of these words among the Ainu languages, its spread and how these words arrived into other languages will possibly remain a mystery.

The most frequent proposals for relatives of Ainu are given below:

Altaic
John C. Street (1962) proposed linking Ainu, Korean, and Japanese in one family and Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic in another, with the two families linked in a common ""North Asiatic"" family. Street's grouping was an extension of the Altaic hypothesis, which at the time linked Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, sometimes adding Korean; today Altaic sometimes includes Korean and rarely Japanese but not Ainu (Georg et al. 1999).

From a perspective more centered on Ainu, James Patrie (1982) adopted the same grouping, namely Ainu–Korean–Japanese and Turkic–Mongolic–Tungusic, with these two families linked in a common family, as in Street's ""North Asiatic"".

Joseph Greenberg (2000–2002) likewise classified Ainu with Korean and Japanese. He regarded ""Korean–Japanese-Ainu"" as forming a branch of his proposed Eurasiatic language family. Greenberg did not hold Korean–Japanese–Ainu to have an especially close relationship with Turkic–Mongolic–Tungusic within this family.

The Altaic hypothesis is now rejected by the scholarly mainstream.

Austroasiatic 
Shafer (1965) presented evidence suggesting a distant connection with the Austroasiatic languages, which include many of the indigenous languages of Southeast Asia. Vovin (1992) presented his reconstruction of Proto-Ainu with evidence, in the form of proposed sound changes and cognates, of a relationship with Austroasiatic. In Vovin (1993), he still regarded this hypothesis as preliminary.

Language contact with the Nivkhs
The Ainu appear to have experienced intensive contact with the Nivkhs during the course of their history. It is not known to what extent this has affected the language. Linguists believe the vocabulary shared between Ainu and Nivkh (historically spoken in the northern half of Sakhalin and on the Asian mainland facing it) is due to borrowing.

Language contact with the Japanese
The Ainu came into extensive contact with the Japanese in 14th century. Analytic grammatical constructions acquired or transformed in Ainu were probably due to contact with the Japanese language. A large number of Japanese loanwords were borrowed into Ainu and to a smaller extent vice versa. There are also a great number of loanwords from the Japanese language in various stages of its development to Hokkaidō Ainu, and a smaller number of loanwords from Ainu into Japanese, particularly animal names such as  (""sea otter""; Ainu ),  (""reindeer""; Ainu ), and  (a fish, Spirinchus lanceolatus; Ainu ). Due to the low status of Ainu in Japan, many ancient loanwords may be ignored or undetected, but there is evidence of an older substrate, where older Japanese words which have no clear etymology appear related to Ainu words which do. An example is modern Japanese  or , meaning ""salmon"", probably from the Ainu  or  for ""salmon"", literally ""summer food"".

According to P. Elmer (2019), the Ainu languages are a contact language, i.e. have strong influences from various Japonic dialects/languages during different stages, suggesting early and intensive contact between them somewhere in the Tōhoku region, with Ainu borrowing a large amount of vocabulary and typological characteristics from early Japonic.

Other proposals 
A small number of linguists suggested a relation between Ainu and Indo-European languages, based on racial theories regarding the origin of the Ainu people. The theory of an Indo-European—Ainu relation was popular until 1960, later linguists dismissed it and did not follow the theory any more and concentrated on more local language families.

Tambotsev (2008) proposes that Ainu is typologically most similar to Native American languages and suggests that further research is needed to establish a genetic relationship between these languages.

Geography 
Until the 20th century, Ainu languages were spoken throughout the southern half of the island of Sakhalin and by small numbers of people in the Kuril Islands. Only the Hokkaido variant survives, with the last speaker of Sakhalin Ainu having died in 1994.

Some linguists noted that the Ainu language was an important lingua franca on Sakhalin.  (2005) reported that the status of the Ainu language was rather high and was also used by early Russian and Japanese administrative officials to communicate with each other and with the indigenous people.

Ainu on mainland Japan

It is occasionally suggested that Ainu was the language of the indigenous  people of the northern part of the main Japanese island of Honshu. The main evidence for this is the presence of placenames that appear to be of Ainu origin in both locations. For example, the  common to many northern Japanese place names is known to derive from the Ainu word  (""river"") in Hokkaidō, and the same is suspected of similar names ending in  in northern Honshū and , such as the  and  rivers in Toyama Prefecture. Other place names in  and , such as Mount Ashigara (),  (modern Tokyo), Keta Shrine (), and the Noto Peninsula, have no explanation in Japanese, but do in Ainu. The traditional  hunters of the mountain forests of  retain Ainu words in their hunting vocabulary. However Japonic etymologies have also been suggested, which got borrowed into early Ainu and lost in contemporary Japonic dialects.

The direction of influence and migration is debated. It has been proposed that at least some Jōmon period groups spoke a proto-Ainu language, and that they displaced the Okhotsk culture north from southern Hokkaido when the Ainu fled Japanese expansion into northern Honshu, with the Okhotsk ancestral to the modern Nivkh as well as a component of the modern Ainu. However, it has also been proposed that the Ainu themselves can be identified with the Okhotsk culture, and that they expanded south into northern Honshu as well as to the Kamchatka Peninsula, or that the Emishi spoke a Japonic language, most closely related to ancient Izumo dialect, rather than anything related to Ainu, with Ainu-speakers migrating later from Hokkaido to northern Tōhoku. The purported evidence for this are old-Japanese loanwords in the Ainu language, including basic vocabulary, as well as distinctive Japonic terms and toponyms found in Tōhoku and Hokkaido, that have been linked to the Izumo dialect.

Eady was born in 1956 in the village of Buqu'ya in the Upper Galilee region of Israel, and took an interest in theater from an early age. He earned a B.A. in social work from the University of Haifa, and then worked as the artistic director of a theater. He then moved to the United States to study theater, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts in theater from the University of Wisconsin and a Master of Fine Arts in drama and directing from the University of Washington in Seattle.

After obtaining his third academic degree, Eady opened the New Image Theater Company, where he wrote and produced numerous plays, including Seeing Double (1991) and Abraham's Land (1992). The play Suhmata, which he co-wrote with Edward Mast, depicts the 1948 destruction of a Palestinian village of that name during the 1948 Palestine war. The play debuted in Seattle in 1996 and has since been performed in various theaters in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.

It is located to the north of the prominent crater Tsiolkovskiy, and east-southeast of Dobrovol'skiy. Overlying the southeastern rim of Volkov is the satellite crater Volkov J, and the two have merged to form a figure-8 shape. The crater Lander is attached to the southwest rim of Volkov J, making this a triple-crater formation.

The outer rim of Volkov is moderately eroded, with a small crater across the northeast rim and a gap in the southeast where it joins Volkov J. The inner walls are relatively featureless, with a few tiny craterlets marking the surface. The interior floor of the crater is lumpy, with low hills and a few tiny craterlets.

It is named after Russian–Soviet cosmonaut Vladislav Volkov who died in Soyuz 11 mission on 30 June 1971 during the vehicle's return to the Earth.

Satellite craters 

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Volkov.

It is a story portraying an ordinary woman who is framed by the Mafia, her subsequent quest for vengeance towards them and her later life as a con artist. The novel was adapted into a three-part TV miniseries with the same name in 1986, starring Madolyn Smith and Tom Berenger.

Plot
Tracy is a successful bank-worker in Philadelphia, engaged to a wealthy heir, whose child she is carrying. Then her mother commits suicide, after being scammed by the New Orleans Mafia and left in debt. Tracy gets a gun to frighten the scammer, Joe Romano, into admitting her mother’s innocence, but he tries to rape her and is wounded in the struggle. Her attorney convinces her that she will get a much shorter sentence if she pleads guilty, but the judge sentences her to fifteen years to Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women, and she realises that the judge and the attorney are both working for Romano’s boss, mafia Don Anthony Orsatti. As she goes to jail, her employer and her fiancé abandon her and the unborn child, which she miscarries under the horrendous abuse she suffers from her prison mates. 
 
Tracy now decides to avenge herself on all the men who have ruined her life. Granted an official pardon for saving the life of the warden's daughter, she uses her banking knowledge to divert large sums into Romano’s account, making it look as though he was planning to skip the country, and Orsatti imprisons him for his apparent betrayal. Then she gets the boyfriend of one of her jail-mates to plant evidence in the attorney’s home, making it look as though he was cheating Orsatti at cards, and Orsatti teaches him a lesson too. While the judge is in Russia, she sends him coded letters that implicate him as a spy, and he is sentenced to fourteen years of hard labor in Siberia. She stalks her ex-fiancé and his new wife, but decides that they look so bored and unhappy with each other that no further punishment is needed.

With a criminal record, however, her career is over, and she reluctantly slips into crime, presently finding that she enjoys stealing, especially from those who deserve to be stolen from. In the course of a colorful crime spree all over Europe with FBI, INTERPOL and Federal Police stalking, she falls in love with one of her co-conspirators, Jeff Stevens, and they plan to take their winnings and live the law-abiding life in Brazil. But on the plane, she finds herself sitting next to wealthy top criminal Maximilian Pierpont, who shows a strong interest in her, and we are left wondering if she will try to steal from him too.

178,27758191,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti%20in%20the%20United%20States,Graffiti in the United States,"Graffiti are writing or drawings scribbled, scratched, or sprayed illicitly on a wall or other surface in a public place. Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings. Graffiti, consisting of the defacement of public spaces and buildings, remains a nuisance issue for cities.

In America around the late 1960s, graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists, and also by gangs such as the Savage Skulls, La Familia, and Savage Nomads to mark territory. Towards the end of the 1960s, the signatures—tags—of Philadelphia graffitists Cornbread, Cool Earl, Sketch and Topcat 126 started to appear. Cornbread is often cited as one of the earliest practitioner of modern graffiti. Around 1970–71, the center of graffiti innovation moved to New York City, where graffitists following in the wake of TAKI 183, Tracy 168 and PHASE 2 would add their street number to their nickname, ""bomb"" a train with their work, and let the subway take it ""all city""—along with their fame, if it was impressive or simply pervasive enough. Bubble lettering held sway initially among graffitists from the Bronx, though the elaborate writing Tracy 168 dubbed ""wildstyle"" would come to define the art.  The early trendsetters were joined in the 70s by graffitists like Dondi, Zephyr and Lady Pink.

Graffiti is one of the four main elements of hip hop culture (along with rapping, DJing, and break dancing). The relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffitists practicing other aspects of hip-hop, and it's being practiced in areas where other elements of hip hop were evolving as art forms. By the mid-eighties, the form would move from the street to the art world. Jean-Michel Basquiat would abandon his SAMO tag for art galleries, and street art's connections to hip-hop would loosen. Occasional hip hop paeans to graffiti could still be heard throughout the nineties, however, in tracks like the Artifacts' ""Wrong Side of Da Tracks"", Qwel's ""Brick Walls"" and Aesop Rock's ""No Jumper Cables"".

Origins 

Early modernist graffiti can be dated back to boxcars in the early 1920s yet the graffiti movement seen in today's contemporary world really originated through the minds of political activists and gang members of the 1960s. The ""pioneering era"" of graffiti took place during the years 1969 through 1974. This time period was a time of change in popularity and style. New York City became the new hub (formerly Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and to a lesser degree in Boston) of graffiti tags and images. graffitists during this time period sought to put as many markings up as possible around the city. This was the ultimate goal of exposure. Soon after the migration from Philadelphia to New York City, the city produced one of the first graffiti graffitists to gain media attention in itself, TAKI 183. TAKI 183 was a youth from Washington Heights, Manhattan who worked as a foot messenger. His tag is a mixture of his name Demetrius (Demetraki), TAKI, and his street number, 183rd. Being a foot messenger, he was constantly on the subway and began to put up his tags along with his travels. This spawned a 1971 article in the New York Times titled ""'Taki 183' Spawns Pen Pals"". Julio 204 is also credited as an early graffitist, though not recognized at the time outside of the graffiti subculture.

Also taking place during this era was the movement from outside on the city streets to the subways. Graffiti also saw its first seeds of competition around this time. The goal of most graffitists at this point was having as many tags and bombs in as many places as possible. Graffitists began to break into subway yards in order to paint as many trains as they could with a lower risk, often creating larger elaborate pieces of art along the subway car sides.

By 1971 tags began to take on their signature calligraphic appearance because, due to the huge number of participants, each participant needed a way to distinguish themselves. Aside from the growing complexity and creativity, tags also began to grow in size and scale – for example, many graffitists had begun to increase letter size and line thickness, as well as outlining their tags. This gave birth to the so-called 'masterpiece' or 'piece' in 1972. Super Kool 223 is credited as being the first to do these pieces.

The use of designs such as polka dots, crosshatches, and checkers became increasingly popular. Spray paint use increased dramatically around this time as graffitists began to expand their work. ""Top-to-bottoms"", works which span the entire height of a subway car, made their first appearance around this time as well. The overall creativity and artistic maturation of this time period did not go unnoticed by the public – Hugo Martinez founded the United graffitists (UGA) in 1972. UGA consisted of many top graffitists of the time and aimed to present graffiti in an art gallery setting. By 1974, graffitists had begun to incorporate the use of scenery and cartoon characters into their work. TF5 (The Fabulous Five), was a crew which was known for their elaborately designed whole cars.

New York City

Mid–1970s 

By the mid-1970s, most standards had been set in graffiti writing and culture. The heaviest ""bombing"" in U.S. history took place in this period, partially because of the economic restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to combat this art form with graffiti removal programs or transit maintenance. ""Top-to-bottoms"" evolved to take up entire subway cars. A notable development was the ""throw-up,"" which is more complex than simple ""tagging"" but not as intricate as a ""piece."" Not long after their introduction, throw-ups led to races to see who could do the largest number in the shortest time.

Graffiti writing was becoming very competitive and graffiti participants strove to go ""all-city,"" or to have their names seen in all five boroughs. Eventually, the standards set in the early 1970s began to stagnate, and in the 1980s graffitists began to expand and change the subculture as described in the 1984 book Subway Art.

The late 1970s and early 1980s brought a new wave of creativity to the scene. As the influence of graffiti grew beyond the Bronx, a movement began with the encouragement of Friendly Freddie. Fab 5 Freddy (Fred Brathwaite) is another popular graffiti figure of this time, who started in a Brooklyn ""wall-writing group."" He notes how differences in spray technique and letters between Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn began to merge in the late 70s: ""out of that came 'Wild Style'."" Fab 5 Freddy is often credited with helping to spread the influence of graffiti and rap music beyond its early foundations in the Bronx, and making links with the mostly white downtown art and music scenes. It was around this time that the established art world started becoming receptive to the graffiti culture for the first time since Hugo Martinez's Razor Gallery in the early 1970s.

It was also, however, the last wave of significant graffiti occurrences before the Transit Authority made graffiti eradication a priority. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) began to repair yard fences and remove graffiti consistently. With the MTA consistently abating graffiti, many graffitists have quit applying graffiti on their property.

Decline 

Just as the culture was spreading outside New York City and overseas, the cultural aspect of graffiti in New York City was said to be deteriorating almost to the point of extinction. The rapid decline in writing was due to several factors. The streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning crack epidemic, legislation was underway to make penalties graffiti vandalism more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made shoplifting more difficult. Above all, the MTA greatly increased their anti-graffiti budget. Many favored painting sites became heavily guarded, yards were patrolled, newer and better fences were erected, and buffing of pieces was strong, heavy, and consistent. Stainless steel, to which paint adheres poorly (and was easily removed by the powerful cleaning solutions and spinning brushes used in automatic car washers at the yards) had also become the car body material of choice for new rolling stock, retiring hundreds of worn out carbon-steel bodied subway cars whose exteriors had made an ideal canvas for taggers. As a result of rolling stock being harder to paint, more graffitists went into the streets, which is now, along with commuter trains and box cars, the most prevalent form of writing.

Many graffitists, however, chose to see the new problems as a challenge rather than a reason to quit. A downside to these challenges was that they became very territorial of good spots, and strength and unity in numbers became increasingly important.  Some of the mentionable graffitists from this era were Blade, Dondi, Min 1, Quik, Seen and Skeme. This was stated to be the end for the casual New York City Subway graffitists, and the years to follow would be populated by only what some consider the most ""die-hard"" graffitists. People often found that making graffiti around their local areas was an easy way to get caught so they traveled to different areas.

1985–1989 

The years between 1985 and 1989 became known as the ""die-hard"" era. The last shot for the graffiti participants of this time was in the form of subway cars destined for the scrap yard. With the increased security, the culture had taken a step back. The previous elaborate ""burners"" on the outside of cars were now marred with simplistic marker tags which often soaked through the paint.

By mid-1986 the MTA and the CTA were winning their ""war on graffiti,"" and the population of active graffitists diminished. As their population lowered so did the violence associated with graffiti crews and ""bombing."" Roof tops also were being the new billboards for some '80s graffitists.

Clean Train Movement 
The current era in graffiti is characterized by a majority of participants moving from train carriages to ""street galleries."" The Clean Train Movement started in May 1989, when New York City attempted to remove all of the subway cars found with graffiti on them out of the transit system, as they brought in new graffiti-free rolling stock like the R62,  R62A, R68, and R68A. Because of this, many graffiti vandals were unable to continue vandalizing them. Much controversy arose among the streets debating whether graffiti should be considered an actual form of art. Videograf Productions was the first graffiti video series to document the New York City's clean train movement.

Prior to the Clean Train Movement, the streets were largely left untouched not only in New York City but in other major American cities as well. After the transit company began diligently cleaning their trains, graffiti burst onto the streets of America to an unsuspecting, unappreciative public.

City officials elsewhere in the country smugly assumed that gang graffiti was a blight limited largely to the Big Apple.

No more. The stylised smears born in the South Bronx have spread across the country, covering buildings, bridges, and highways in every urban center. From Philadelphia to Santa Barbara, Calif., the annual costs of cleaning up after the underground artists are soaring into the billions.

During this period many graffitists had taken to displaying their works in galleries and owning their own studios. This practice started in the early 1980s with practitioners such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, who started out tagging locations with his moniker SAMO (Same Old Shit), and Keith Haring, who was also able to take his art into studio spaces.

In some cases, graffiti practitioners had achieved such elaborate graffiti (especially those done in memory of a deceased person) on storefront gates that shopkeepers have hesitated to cover them up. In the Bronx after the death of  rapper Big Pun, several murals dedicated to his life done by BG183, Bio, Nicer TATS CRU appeared virtually overnight; similar outpourings occurred after the deaths of The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Big L, and Jam Master Jay.

St. Louis 

A regularly scheduled event called Paint Louis is held annually St. Louis. Paint Louis brings together graffitists from around the world to paint for two days as a celebration of the craft to paint on the longest continuous wall to make the ""longest mural in the world.""

Regulations 
The application of graffiti is illegal in many cities. Graffiti-making supplies may be regulated by local ordinances.

Oregon 
The intentional application of graffiti is inclusive under the state statute ORS 164.354 - Criminal Mischief II without regard to amount of damage. It is punishable by up to one year of incarceration. Additionally, applying graffiti in which the damage exceeds $1,000 or on certain categories of property such as those owned by railroad is chargeable as a felony.

Additional restrictions may apply through locality specific ordinances that may apply to the acts of applying graffiti, commanding others to apply graffiti, causing graffiti to be applied, as well allowing graffiti to remain on surfaces within their respective jurisdictions.

For example, the city of Forest Grove code states that 
""5.160 Graffiti Prohibited (1) It is unlawful and a violation of this Ordinance for any person to place or put by any means, any drawing, inscription, figure, symbol, mark, or any type of graffiti on any public or private property without the consent of the owner, occupant or responsible party of the premises, or upon natural surfaces such as rocks, trees or any surface whatsoever. It is unlawful and a violation of this Ordinance for any person to solicit or command another person to apply graffiti or aid or abet another person in applying graffiti.""Beaverton's code includes to read regulations against the application as well as keeping of graffiti. 
5.05.093 Graffiti. No person shall place, or cause to be placed, graffiti upon any property in the City of Beaverton. No owner or occupant of property shall allow graffiti to be on the property. Property upon which graffiti has been placed and has remained for more than seven (7) days is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and shall be subject to the provisions of BC 5.05.230 relating to summary abatement.

Public opinion
Graffiti proponents perceive it as a method of reclaiming public space or displaying an art form; their opponents regard it as a nuisance, or as costly vandalism requiring abatement. Graffiti can be viewed as a ""quality of life"" issue, and its detractors suggest that the presence of graffiti contributes to a general sense of squalor and a heightened fear of crime. Graffiti has a strong negative influence on property values and lowers the tax base, reducing the available funding for municipal services, such as schools, fire protection, and sanitation.

In 1984, the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network (PAGN) was created to combat the city's growing concerns about gang-related graffiti. PAGN led to the creation of the Mural Arts Program, which replaced often-hit spots with elaborate, commissioned murals that were protected by a city ordinance, with fines and penalties for anyone caught defacing them.

Philadelphia's Broad-Ridge Spur also features a long-standing example of the art form at the Spring Garden (to 8th and Market). While still existing, it has long been quarantined and features tags and murals that have existed for upwards of 15 years.

Advocates of the broken window theory believe that this sense of decay encourages further vandalism and promotes an environment leading to offenses that are more serious. Former New York City mayor Ed Koch's vigorous subscription to the broken window theory promoted the aggressive anti-graffiti campaign in New York City in the early 1980s, resulting in ""the buff""; a chemical wash for trains that dissolved the paint. New York City has adopted a strenuous zero tolerance policy ever since. However, throughout the world, authorities often treat graffiti as a minor-nuisance crime, though with widely varying penalties. In New York City rooftops became the mainstream graffiti location after graffiti on trains died out.

In 1995 New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani set up the Anti-Graffiti Task Force, a multi-agency initiative to combat the perceived problem of graffiti vandals in New York City. This began a crackdown on ""quality of life crimes"" throughout the city, and one of the largest anti-graffiti campaigns in U.S. history. That same year Title 10–117 of the New York Administrative Code banned the sale of aerosol spray-paint cans to children under 18. The law also requires that merchants who sell spray paint must either lock it in a case or display the cans behind a counter, out of reach of potential shoplifters. Violations of the city's anti-graffiti law carry fines of US$350 per incident.

On January 1, 2006, in New York City, legislation created by Councilmember Peter Vallone, Jr. attempted to make it illegal for a person under the age of 21 to possess spray paint or permanent markers. The law prompted outrage by fashion and media mogul Marc Ecko who sued Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Councilmember Vallone on behalf of art students and graffiti artists. On May 1, 2006, Judge George B. Daniels granted the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction against the recent amendments to the anti-graffiti legislation, effectively prohibiting (on May 4) the New York Police Department from enforcing the restrictions.  A similar measure was proposed in New Castle County, Delaware in April 2006 and passed into law as a county ordinance in May 2006.

Chicago's mayor, Richard M. Daley created the ""Graffiti Blasters"" to eliminate graffiti and gang-related vandalism. The bureau advertises free cleanup within 24 hours of a phone call. The bureau uses paints (compatible with the city's 'color scheme') and baking-soda-based solvents to remove some varieties of graffiti.

In 1992, an ordinance was passed in Chicago that bans the sale and possession of spray paint and certain types of etching equipment and markers. The law falls under Chapter 8-4: Public Peace & Welfare, Section 100: Vagrancy. The specific law (8-4-130) makes graffiti an offense with a fine of no less than US$500 per incident, surpassing the penalty for public drunkenness, peddling, or disrupting a religious service.

In 2005, the city of Pittsburgh implemented a customized database-driven graffiti tracking system to build evidence for prosecution of graffiti suspects by linking tags to instances of graffiti. One of the first suspects to be identified by the system as being responsible for significant graffiti vandalism was Daniel Montano, known as MFONE. He was dubbed ""The King of Graffiti"" for having tagged close to 200 buildings in the city, and was later sentenced to 2.5 to 5 years in prison.

Rapid City, South Dakota contains a section of the city known as Art Alley, a back alley in the downtown district between Main Street and Saint Joseph Street and stretching from 6th to 7th Street. It first began to properly form around 2005, and has expanded since. While graffiti is largely illegal in Rapid City and there are no ordinances condoning it, Art Alley is purposefully overlooked by law enforcement and clean up crews and relies on the community of artists and landowners to add to and maintain the space. The alley has become quite popular for tourists and has become a cultural center for the city.

The Chicago Transit Authority has been utilizing the civil court system to sue graffiti vandals or parents of juvenile vandals that have been caught to recover the clean-up costs. The Agency reported they experience about $1 million in graffiti related expenses annually.

Comparison with street art 
Typically, the term street art, or the more specific post-graffiti, is used to distinguish contemporary public-space artwork from territorial graffiti, vandalism, and corporate art. Some people consider street art a crime; others consider it a form of art. It is a borderline issue.

179,3068409,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%20%28system%20call%29,Open (system call),"For most file systems, a program initializes access to a file in a file system using the open system call. This allocates resources associated to the file (the file descriptor), and returns a handle that the process will use to refer to that file.  In some cases the open is performed by the first access.

The same file may be opened simultaneously by several processes, and even by the same process, resulting in several file descriptors for the same file; depending on the file organization and filesystem. Operations on the descriptors such as moving the file pointer or closing it are independentthey do not affect other descriptors for the same file.  Operations on the file, such as a write, can be seen by operations on the other descriptors: a later read can read the newly written data.

During the open, the filesystem may allocate memory for buffers, or it may wait until the first operation.

The absolute file path is resolved. This may include connecting to a remote host and notifying an operator that a removable medium is required. It may include the initialization of a communication device. At this point an error may be returned if the host or medium is not available. The first access to at least the directory within the filesystem is performed.  An error will usually be returned if the higher level components of the path (directories) cannot be located or accessed.  An error will be returned if the file is expected to exist and it does not or if the file should not already exist and it does.

If the file is expected to exist and it does, the file access, as restricted by permission flags within the file meta data or access control list, is validated against the requested type of operations.  This usually requires an additional filesystem access although in some filesystems meta-flags may be part of the directory structure.

If the file is being created, the filesystem may allocate the default initial amount of storage or a specified amount depending on the file system capabilities.  If this fails an error will be returned. Updating the directory with the new entry may be performed or it may be delayed until the close is performed.

Various other errors which may occur during the open include directory update failures, un-permitted multiple connections, media failures, communication link failures and device failures.

The return value must always be examined and an error specific action taken.

In many cases programming language-specific run-time library opens may perform additional actions including initializing a run-time library structure related to the file.

As soon as a file is no longer needed, the program should close it. This will cause run-time library and filesystem buffers to be updated to the physical media and permit other processes to access the data if exclusive use had been required. Some run-time libraries may close a file if the program calls the run-time exit. Some filesystems may perform the necessary operations if the program terminates. Neither of these is likely to take place in the event of a kernel or power failure. This can cause damaged filesystem structures requiring the running of privileged and lengthy filesystem utilities during which the entire filesystem may be inaccessible.

open call arguments
The pathname to the file,
The kind of access requested on the file (read, write, append etc.),
The initial file permission is requested using the third argument called mode. This argument is relevant only when a new file is being created.

After using the file, the process should close the file using close call, which takes the file descriptor of the file to be closed. Some filesystems include a disposition to permit releasing the file.

Some computer languages include run-time libraries which include additional functionality for particular filesystems. The open (or some auxiliary routine) may include specifications for key size, record size, connection speed. Some open routines include specification of the program code to be executed in the event of an error.

Perl language form 
open FILEHANDLE,MODE[,EXPR]

for example:

open(my $fh, "">"", ""output.txt"");

Perl also uses the tie function of the Tie::File module to associate an array with a 
file. The tie::AnyDBM_File function associates a hash with a file.

C library POSIX definition 
The  open call is standardized by the POSIX specification for C language:

int open(const char *path, int oflag, .../*,mode_t mode */);
int openat(int fd, const char *path, int oflag, ...);
int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode);
FILE *fopen(const char *restrict filename, const char *restrict mode);

The value returned is a file descriptor which is a reference to a process specific  structure which contains, among other things, a position pointer that indicates which place in the file will be acted upon by the next operation.

Open may return −1 indicating a failure with errno detailing the error.

The file system also updates a global table of all open files which is used for determining if a file is currently in use by any process.

path 
The name of the file to open. It includes the file path defining where, in which file system, the file is found (or should be created).

openat expects a relative path.

oflag 
This argument formed by OR'ing together optional parameters and  (from <fcntl.h>) one of:

O_RDONLY, O_RDWR and O_WRONLY

Option parameters include:

O_APPEND data written will be appended to the end of the file. The file operations will always adjust the position pointer to the end of the file.

O_CREAT Create the file if it does not exist; otherwise the open fails setting errno to ENOENT.

O_EXCL Used with O_CREAT if the file already exists, then fail, setting errno to EEXIST.

O_TRUNC If the file already exists  then discard its previous contents, reducing it to an empty file. Not applicable for a device or named pipe.

Additional flags and errors are defined in open call.
    
creat() is implemented as:

int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode)
{
    return open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, mode);
}

fopen uses string flags such as r, w, a and + and returns a file pointer used with fgets, fputs and fclose.

mode 
Optional and relevant only when creating a new file, defines the
file permissions. These include  read, write or execute the file by the owner, group or all users. The mode is masked by the calling process's umask: bits set in the umask are cleared in the mode.

180,66966731,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora%20%28film%29,Flora (film),"Flora is a 2017 Canadian independent science fiction thriller and historical drama written and directed by Sasha Louis Vukovic.  He sought to ""make a movie which is not about a bunch of kids running from a horrible slasher"". The film follows a group of students on a university botany expedition as they try to survive and avoid exposure to an unknown pathogen. 

The film is Sasha Louis Vukovic's directorial debut and appeared at several film festivals worldwide.

Plot
In the spring of 1929, a team of student botanists arrive in an uncharted forest somewhere in North America on expedition to chart the native flora. The students arrive to find their professor absent and their food supplies destroyed. After a day of waiting for the his return, they begin a search to find the missing professor. The professor is found deceased, wearing a gas mask, at a nearby abandoned mining town. Gradually, some of the students begin falling ill to an unknown pathogen. 

The professor's protégé, Matsudaira Basho, is able to deduce from the complete absence of animal life in the region that the pathogen may be an endophyte present in the local plant life and transmitted by consumption or plants or through inhalation of pollen.  In light of the lack of food supplies, the students embark on a trek through the forest to reach a railway where they might be able to rendezvous with a monthly train that is scheduled to pass by in several days time. The students prepare foods from local plant material by boiling the harvest in order to render them non-pathogenic and create biohazard suits with gas masks to prevent infection. 

Along the journey, all but one of the students falls ill to the pathogen. She arrives at the railway and sees the train coming.

Production

The film was privately funded by Vukovic’s family and friends, with a micro-budget estimated at $100,000 USD (or $120,000 CAD). Despite a budget of only $2000 for props, Vukovic was able to obtain props appropriate to the 1920s through eBay and a Canadian historian, Alan Skeoch. One of Vukovik's family members owns a 1931 Ford A Tudor which was featured in the opening of the film. Several of the cast members also participated in other aspects of the production, for example with Doran both playing the character Ora and leading Art Direction.

Principal photography was carried out over six weeks from June 29 through August 16, 2015. Post-production was completed on October 1, 2016. Filming was performed in Val-Jalbert, a preserved ghost town in Québec, as well as Ottawa and Manitoulin Island in Ontario. Post-production was performed at Eggplant Picture & Sound in Toronto and completed on October 1, 2016.

Release
Flora premiered at Sci-Fi-London on April 29, 2017 and was submitted to 70 festivals around the world. 
 
The film was released on Blu-Ray on August 7, 2018.

Reception
The screenplay for Flora, written by Sasha Vukovic, won the 2015 Van Gogh Award in the Feature Screenplay Competition. The film was praised as ""a refreshing take on the ‘monster-in-the-woods’ canon"" and received the Sci-Fi-London festival award for Best Feature 2017. 

Other awards include the 2017 Van Gogh Cinematic Vision Award from the Amsterdam Film Festival; five awards including Best Science Fiction Feature at the Miami International Science Fiction Film Festival; The 2018 Museum of Science Fiction Maria Award for Excellence for Best Feature and Best Acting at Escape Velocity Film Festival;  and the 2017 award for Best Score at FilmQuest.  

Many critics have noted the film's quality despite the extremely low budget on which it was produced. It has been compared with The Happening, and described as being atypical of the typical ""nature's revenge"" horror scenario. Vukovik has stated that the film is ""science fact more than it is science fiction"".

181,2759726,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers%20of%20Horror,Powers of Horror,"Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection () is a 1980 book by Julia Kristeva. The work is an extensive treatise on the subject of abjection, in which Kristeva draws on the theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan to examine horror, marginalization, castration, the phallic signifier, the ""I/Not I"" dichotomy, the Oedipal complex, exile, and other concepts appropriate to feminist criticism and queer theory.

According to Kristeva, the abject marks a ""primal order"" that escapes signification in the symbolic order; the term is used to refer to the human reaction (horror, vomit) to a threatened breakdown in meaning caused by the loss of the distinction between subject and object, or between the self and the other.

Compared to Lacan
Kristeva's understanding of the ""abject"" provides a helpful term to contrast to Lacan's objet petit a (or the ""object - cause of desire""). Whereas the objet petit a allows a subject to coordinate his or her desires, thus allowing the symbolic order of meaning and intersubjective community to persist, the abject ""is radically excluded and,"" as Kristeva explains, ""draws me toward the place where meaning collapses"" (Powers 2). It is neither object nor subject; the abject is situated, rather, at a place before we entered into the symbolic order. (On the symbolic order, see, in particular, the Lacan module on psychosexual development.) As Kristeva puts it, ""Abjection preserves what existed in the archaism of pre-objectal relationship, in the immemorial violence with which a body becomes separated from another body in order to be"" (Powers 10). The abject marks what Kristeva terms a ""primal repression,"" one that precedes the establishment of the subject's relation to its objects of desire and of representation, before even the establishment of the opposition between consciousness and the unconscious.

Kristeva refers, instead, to the moment in our psychosexual development when we established a border or separation between human and animal, between culture and that which preceded it. On the level of archaic memory, Kristeva refers to the primitive effort to separate ourselves from the animal: ""by way of abjection, primitive societies have marked out a precise area of their culture in order to remove it from the threatening world of animals or animalism, which were imagined as representatives of sex and murder"" (Powers 12-13). On the level of our individual psychosexual development, the abject marks the moment when we separated ourselves from the mother, when we began to recognize a boundary between ""me"" and other, between ""me"" and ""(m)other."" (See the Kristeva Module on Psychosexual Development.) The abject is ""a precondition of narcissism"" (Powers 13), which is to say, a precondition for the narcissism of the mirror stage, which occur after we establish these primal distinctions. The abject thus at once represents the threat that meaning is breaking down and constitutes our reaction to such a breakdown: a reestablishment of our ""primal repression."" The abject has to do with ""what disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules"" (Powers 4) and, so, can also include crimes like Auschwitz. Such crimes are abject precisely because they draw attention to the ""fragility of the law"" (Powers 4).

Eruption of the Real
More specifically, Kristeva associates the abject with the eruption of the Real into our lives. In particular, she associates such a response with our rejection of death's insistent materiality. Our reaction to such abject material recharges what is essentially a pre-lingual response. Kristeva, therefore, is quite careful to differentiate knowledge of death or the meaning of death (both of which can exist within the symbolic order) from the traumatic experience of being actually confronted with the sort of materiality that traumatically shows one's own death:

""A wound with blood and pus, or the sickly, acrid smell of sweat, of decay, does not signify death. In the presence of signified death—a flat encephalograph, for instance—I would understand, react, or accept. No, as in true theater, without makeup or masks, refuse and corpses show me what I permanently thrust aside in order to live. These body fluids, this defilement, this shit are what life withstands, hardly and with difficulty, on the part of death. There, I am at the border of my condition as a living being."" (Powers 3)

The corpse especially exemplifies Kristeva's concept since it literalizes the breakdown of the distinction between subject and object that is crucial for the establishment of identity and for our entrance into the symbolic order. What we are confronted with when we experience the trauma of seeing a human corpse (particularly the corpse of a friend or family member) is our own eventual death made palpably real. As Kristeva puts it, ""The corpse, seen without God and outside of science, is the utmost of abjection. It is death infecting life. Abject"" (Powers 4).

Comparison with desire
The abject must also be distinguished from desire (which is tied up with the meaning-structures of the symbolic order). It is associated, rather, with both fear and jouissance. In phobia, Kristeva reads the trace of a pre-linguistic confrontation with the abject, a moment that precedes the recognition of any actual object of fear: ""The phobic object shows up at the place of non-objectal states of drive and assumes all the mishaps of drive as disappointed desires or as desires diverted from their objects"" (Powers 35 ). The object of fear is, in other words, a substitute formation for the subject's abject relation to drive. The fear of, say, heights really stands in the place of a much more primal fear: the fear caused by the breakdown of any distinction between subject and object, of any distinction between ourselves and the world of dead material objects (reference page?).

Kristeva also associates the abject with jouissance: ""One does not know it, one does not desire it, one joys in it [on en jouit]. Violently and painfully. A passion"" (Powers 9). This statement appears paradoxical, but what Kristeva means by such statements is that we are, despite everything, continually and repetitively drawn to the abject (much as we are repeatedly drawn to trauma in Freud's understanding of repetition compulsion). To experience the abject in literature carries with it a certain pleasure but one that is quite different from the dynamics of desire. Kristeva associates this aesthetic experience of the abject, rather, with poetic catharsis: ""an impure process that protects from the abject only by dint of being immersed in it"" (Powers 29).

Purifying the abject
The abject for Kristeva is, therefore, closely tied both to religion and to art, which she sees as two ways of purifying the abject: ""The various means of purifying the abject—the various catharses—make up the history of religions, and end up with that catharsis par excellence called art, both on the far and near side of religion"" (Powers 17). According to Kristeva, the best modern literature (Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges, Antonin Artaud, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Franz Kafka, etc.) explores the place of the abject, a place where boundaries begin to break down, where people are confronted with an archaic space before such linguistic binaries as self/other or subject/object.

The transcendent or sublime, for Kristeva, is really our effort to cover over the breakdowns (and subsequent reassertion of boundaries) associated with the abject; and literature is the privileged space for both the sublime and abject: ""On close inspection, all literature is probably a version of the apocalypse that seems to me rooted, no matter what its sociohistorical conditions might be, on the fragile border (borderline cases) where identities (subject/object, etc.) do not exist or only barely so—double, fuzzy, heterogeneous, animal, metamorphosed, altered, abject"" (Powers 207 ). According to Kristeva, literature explores the way that language is structured over a lack, a want. She privileges poetry, in particular, because of poetry's willingness to play with grammar, metaphor and meaning, thus laying bare the fact that language is at once arbitrary and limned with the abject fear of loss: ""Not a language of the desiring exchange of messages or objects that are transmitted in a social contract of communication and desire beyond want, but a language of want, of the fear that edges up to it and runs along its edges"" (Powers 38 ).

Lerstad completed his clarinet studies with Olav Rimstad at the Music Concervatory (today the Norwegian Academy of Music) in 1974. After high school, Lerstad studied clarinet with Richard Kjelstrup at the Norwegian Academy of Music, followed by bass clarinet studies with Harry Sparnaay in Holland. Lerstad graduated with a diploma from the Koninklijk Conservatorium, Haag in 1982.

From 1979 to 1981, Lerstad served as clarinetist in the Staff Band of the Norwegian Armed Forces, Halden. Lerstad’s debut concert came in February 1980, and from 1982 he was appointed bass clarinetist in the orchestra of the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet. Lerstad has founded ensembles Bozza Trio and Het Basklarinettencollektief. Lerstad has also been active as a soloist and has performed with the ASKO-ensemble during the Holland Festival in 1982, during the Ny Musikk 1987 Summer Festival, with the Norwegian Radio Orchestra at the 1992 Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival, with the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra in 1993, at the ISCM Festival in Stockholm in 1995 and with Oslo Sinfonietta in 2000. Lerstad is a member of contemporary music ensembles Oslo Sinfonietta and Cikada.

As a composer, Lerstad is predominantly an autodidact, and has a list of works that has surpassed 200. His pre-1972 works are primarily written in a classic/neo-romantic style. The 70s would see a gradual move towards more complex use of harmony and rhythm, while the turn of the decade would see the composer focusing on pre-tonal music from the Renaissance and Medieval Ages as inspirational sources. Over the last three decades, his music has approached modernism, but Lerstad has not written twelve-tone or serial music, instead focusing on influences from renaissance music and traditional music styles from Tibet, Japan and the Balkans.

Biography
Ilse Essers was born Ilse Kober in 1898. She was the daughter of Anne Boeltz and Theodore Kober who worked on the Zeppelin airship. Before going to college, Essers established a new method for calculating measures against the buckling of steel girders. 

She studied physics in Munich before moving on to study engineering in Aachen and graduated in 1926. Essers moved to Berlin where she worked in the aerodynamics department of the Aviation Research Institute. While there Essers discovered how the balance on flaps and rudders affected wing vibrations. She was the first woman awarded a doctorate in mechanical engineering there for her research in 1929. 

Essers married Ernst Essers in 1929 and had four children after 1930. She continued to work and write. She wrote an autobiography and a series of books on the pioneers of science. Essers moved several times from Kiel in 1929 to Berlin in 1944 and Radolfzell on Lake Constance before returning to Aachen in 1946. She died in Aachen in 1994.

An award in her name is given out each year to women students. Ilse-Essers-Strasse is a street in Munich named for her.

The Fugue is a dark bay or brown filly with a white star and stripe and white socks on her hind legs bred by her owner, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Watership Down stud. She was sired by Dansili, whose other progeny include the leading middle-distance winners Harbinger and Rail Link. The Fugue's dam, Twyla Tharp, won only one minor race but was a half sister to Compton Admiral and Summoner. The filly was sent into training with John Gosden at his Clarehaven Stables at Newmarket.

Racing career

2011: two-year-old season
The Fugue made her first appearance in a seven-furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 October 2011. Ridden by Robert Havlin, she was poorly supported in the betting and started at odds of 14/1 in a field of twelve two-year-old fillies. She started slowly and was towards the rear of the field in the early stages before making progress to take the lead inside the final furlong and win by one and a half lengths from Salacia.

2012: three-year-old season
The Fugue made her first appearance of 2012 in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 6 May. Starting at odds of 22/1, she finished fourth of the sixteen runners behind Homecoming Queen. Two weeks later, the filly was then moved up in distance for the Musidora Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. Ridden by William Buick, she took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew clear of her five opponents to win ""very readily"" by four and a half lengths.

On 1 June, The Fugue was made 11/4 favourite for the 234th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. The filly fought Buick's attempts to restrain her in the early stages and turned into the straight in ninth place. She made steady progress in the closing stages to finish third of the twelve runners, beaten a neck and half a length by Was and Shirocco Star. The Daily Express described her as a ""desperately unlucky"" loser. On her next appearance, The Fugue started favourite for the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot but proved no match for the Dermot Weld-trained filly Princess Highway, who beat her into second place by six lengths. In August, The Fugue was brought in distance to contest the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in which her rivals included Was, Nahrain and her stable companion Izzi Top. With Buick being advised by Gosden to ride the 7/4 favourite Izzi Top, The Fugue was ridden by Richard Hughes and started at odds of 11/4. Held up towards the rear of the field, she accelerated in the straight to take the lead fifty yards from the finish and won by a length from Timepiece. Hughes said of The Fugue's performance that ""the more I held her back, the more I knew she was going to really go."" Nineteen days later, The Fugue moved back up in distance for the Yorkshire Oaks and finished second to the French-trained four-year-old Shareta, with Was in third and Shirocco Star in fourth.

On her final race of the season, The Fugue was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park on 2 November. Ridden by Buick, she started the 11/8 favourite against ten opponents. Buick struggled to find racing room and had to switch the filly several times inside the closing stages before obtaining a clear run. The Fugue finished strongly but was an ""unlucky"" third behind Zagora and Marketing Mix.

2013: four-year-old season
According to Gosden, The Fugue did not thrive during the cold winter and spring of 2012/2013, and she did not appear until June, when she took on a field including Camelot, Al Kazeem, Maxios and Red Cadeaux in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Buick, she made steady progress in the straight to finish third of the eleven runners behind Al Kazeem and Mukhadram. The Fugue met Al Kazeem and Mukhadram again in the Eclipse Stakes on 6 July and finished last of the seven runners. A subsequent examination suggested that the filly was suffering from a respiratory infection.

In August, The Fugue ran against all-female competition for the first time in 2013 when she started the 2/1 favourite for the Yorkshire Oaks. Buick sent her into the lead approaching the final furlong, and she drew away from the field to win by four lengths from the Irish-trained Venus de Milo. Gosden expressed his satisfaction with the filly's recovery and nominated the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Breeders' Cup as future targets. On 7 September, The Fugue was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse and started at odds of 4/1 in a field which included Al Kazeem, Trading Leather and Kingsbarns. Buick settled the filly in fourth place as Trading Leather set a strong pace, before moving to the outside to make a challenge in the straight. The Fugue took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Al Kazeem. After the race, Buick said: ""She's one of the greats now. She's always been special and has always been a special one for everybody in the yard. She's very good and has arguably beaten the best around at the moment.""

The Fugue made her final appearance of the year in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on 2 November. Ridden by Buick, she started the 6/4 favourite ahead of the leading North American turf performers Point of Entry, Little Mike, and Big Blue Kitten. The filly settled behind the leaders before moving up to take the lead in the straight. She was caught in the final strides and beaten half a length by the Irish-trained three-year-old Magician.

2014: five-year-old season
In the spring of 2014, The Fugue was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai World Cup at Meydan Racecourse on 29 March but was rerouted to the shorter Dubai Duty Free on turf. Starting the 7/2 second favourite, she tracked the leaders but faded badly in the straight and finished eleventh of the thirteen runners, beaten twenty-six lengths by the winning favourite, Just A Way. On her return to Europe, The Fugue contested the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot on 18 June in which she started at odds of 11/2 in a very strong field including Treve, Magician, Mukhadram and Dank. The mare raced in mid division before moving up to track the leaders in the straight. She overtook Magician approaching the final furlong and won by one and three quarter lengths with Treve a length away in third. The winning time of 2:01.90 was a new course record. After the race, Buick said, ""She's been an absolute star for me and everyone back at the yard. She proved today what she can do against top-class horses. When she gets an uncomplicated run it's no bother to her. When she has a clear run at them she's lethal."" On 5 July, The Fugue started 5/2 favourite to become the third female after Pebbles and Kooyonga to win the Eclipse Stakes. In a race in which many jockeys appeared to misjudge the pace, allowing the front-runners too much leeway, she finished sixth of the nine runners, six lengths behind the winner, Mukhadram.

The Fugue sustained an injury to her left foreleg during the Eclipse Stakes, and her retirement from racing was announced the following week. On the announcement of The Fugue's retirement, Lady Lloyd Webber said ""It is impossible to describe how much fun The Fugue has given us over the last two and a half years... We feel incredibly privileged and lucky to have bred and owned such a magnificent filly and we look forward to her coming home to the stud for her second career"".

Assessment and honours
In the 2012 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, The Fugue was given a rating of 116, making her the 170th best racehorse in the world and the tenth-best three-year-old filly. At the Cartier Racing Awards, The Fugue was named Champion three-year-old filly, despite being rated below Valyra, Ridasiyna, Beauty Parlour, Great Heavens and Princess Highway in the official ratings. In the 2013 World's Best Racehorse Rankings The Fugue was rated the twenty-fourth best racehorse in the world and the best four-year-old filly.

Pedigree
The Fugue was bred by Watership Down Stud (Simon Marsh).

This move has been confirmed by numerous studies. Three other species, M. gatesi, M. kubotai, and M. nana were moved to a new genus, Microdevario, leaving Microrasbora rubescens as the only confirmed species in the genus. However, Fang et al. did not comment on the placement of Microrasbora microphthalma.

196,2574813,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A4ther,Läther,"''Läther'' (, or ""Leather"") is the sixty-fifth official album by Frank Zappa. It was released posthumously as a three-CD set on Rykodisc in 1996. The album's title is derived from bits of comic dialog that link the songs. Zappa also explained that the name is a joke, based on ""bastardized pronunciation of Germanic syllables by the Swiss.""

Läther integrates many aspects of Zappa's musical oeuvre — heavy rock, orchestral works, and complex jazz flavored instrumentals, along with Zappa's distinctive electric guitar solos and satirical lyrics, all edited together in a seemingly random way.

The Läther album was intended for release in 1977 as a four-LP box set, but it never appeared  officially in this format. A variety of bootleg recordings of this material were widely distributed. One of these was a four-LP box on the ""Edison Record"" label and appeared to be  professionally packaged. Zappa's name did not appear on this album but some fans may have been led to believe that it was authorized.

Background
Zappa's relationship with manager Herb Cohen ended in May 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from the DiscReet Records label. The company was co-owned by Zappa and Cohen and distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Zappa was also upset with Cohen for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve.

Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM/Verve over the rights to Zappa's early Mothers of Invention recordings. Legal issues also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa then had his contract re-assigned and took his personal master copies of the album Zoot Allures directly to Warner in October 1976 while bypassing DiscReet. Cohen claimed that this action violated the terms of his contract with Zappa, so the final four albums of Zappa's contract were then assigned back to DiscReet.

Recording sessions
Läther was assembled by Zappa in 1977 from a wide variety of recording sessions stretching back as far as eight years, but mostly between 1972 and 1976. The tracks utilize a constantly changing cast of backing musicians. Most of the songs on Läther are linked together with bits of musical sound effects (musique concrète) and comic dialog from Zappa band members, Terry Bozzio, Patrick O'Hearn, and Davey Moire. More of these same bits, or ""grouts"" as Zappa may have called them, appear on other albums such as Sheik Yerbouti.

Basic tracks for Lemme Take You to the Beach were recorded during 1969 sessions for Hot Rats. The track was finished in 1976 at the Record Plant in Los Angeles. Down in De Dew comes from November 1972 sessions in New York and Los Angeles. For The Young Sophisticate is a 1973 studio recording from Bolic Sound and is different from the later live version on Tinsel Town Rebellion. 

The album's opener Re-Gyptian Strut comes from December 1974 sessions at Caribou Ranch in Colorado. Flambe''' and Spider of Destiny were also recorded at the ranch with additional overdubs in 1976 at the Los Angeles Record Plant. These three are among the songs written by Zappa in 1972 for a stage musical called Hunchentoot. A full script exists, but the recordings of this project were never completed.

The most substantial work is The Adventures of Greggery Peccary, a story set to music, which lasts over 20 minutes. The piece is scored for a large orchestra and was recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1974. More orchestral works come from a September 1975 session with the 37-piece Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra, which was recorded at Royce Hall with conductor Michael Zearott. Zappa said the 1975 orchestral sessions alone cost him about $200,000.

Most of the live tracks were recorded in December 1976 at the Palladium in New York City. The last recordings are live tracks including Tryin' to Grow a Chin from a February 1977 London show at the Hammersmith Odeon. This song also appeared in a different later recording on Sheik Yerbouti.

History
An album titled Six Things was cut as a demo acetate disc at Kendun Recorders in Burbank, California in April 1976. This was an unreleased early edit of music from the orchestral sessions. The same year Zappa tried to negotiate release of an orchestral album with Columbia Masterworks, but the deal fell through when the label did not agree to Zappa's terms. 

During the fall 1976 tour the Zappa band performed in front slide projector images, one of which said ""Warner Bros. Sucks!"" Zappa was upset over inadequate promotion. By late 1976 he was determined to complete his Warner contract as soon as possible. As early as December that year Zappa considered handing multiple individual albums over to Warner and said he had ""more than four"" currently in production. Contracts then stipulated that Zappa deliver four new albums to Warner for release on DiscReet. In December 1977 Zappa said:
""Between last October and December 31 of this year I was required to deliver to Warner Brothers four completed albums. I delivered all four in March of this year.""

Warner was expecting to receive only one album at a time. Upon delivery the label was required to pay Zappa $60,000 per album ($240,000 total) and release the recordings in the United States within six weeks. Warner failed to honor these contractual terms. 

A long legal battle between Zappa and Warner occurred, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Most of the material on Läther would be released during 1978 and 1979 on Zappa in New York, Studio Tan, Sleep Dirt (previously titled Hot Rats III), and Orchestral Favorites. In an October 1978 radio interview, Zappa identified these four individual albums as the ones he previously delivered to Warner and added ""Läther was made out of four albums. Warners has released two of them already and they have two more that they're probably gonna release."" 

The first of these four albums was a two-LP live jazz rock album and was produced with Zappa approved cover art. Two others were single disc jazz rock studio albums, while the last was made up of orchestral recordings. Therefore, the complete four individual album collection actually fills a total of five full length LPs.

After having violated the contract with Zappa, Warner scheduled the release of Zappa in New York on DiscReet in mid 1977. A ""Dateline Burbank"" ad in the June 30, 1977 issue of Rolling Stone magazine described the release of the album as ""imminent"". A few uncensored full length copies appeared but the album was quickly pulled from stores. Warner and Discreet were forced to withdraw it by November due to legal action. Zappa objected to the release at this time. He also claimed that Warner first began to manufacture the album only when they heard he had negotiated to release the recordings with a competing company.

At approximately the same time Zappa was also planning a four-LP box set titled Läther. The album was completed at the Los Angeles Record Plant and Zappa's handwriting on the tape boxes show either EMI or Arista as the intended client. Frank's wife Gail Zappa claimed that Warner, wary of a four-LP box, had declined to release the material in this format.Lowe, 2006, The Words and Music of Frank Zappa, p. 131.Miles, Barry (2004), Frank Zappa, p. 267. Both sets of recordings (five-LP and four-LP) have much of the same music, but each also has unique content. Zappa announced Läther in a mid September 1977 interview, following a concert in San Diego. He described it as his ""current album"".

Zappa attempted to get Läther released in the four-LP box configuration as the first release on the Zappa Records label. He briefly negotiated distribution with Capitol/EMI and then Phonogram Inc. At Phonogram the project reached the test pressing stage and was scheduled for a Halloween, October 31, 1977 release. But Warner interfered with these negotiations by claiming rights over the material.  By this point Zappa had refused a music copyright license to Warner to reproduce the songs. 

Following this Zappa appeared on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ in December 1977 and played the entire test pressing of Läther. While encouraging listeners to record the broadcast Zappa also counterclaimed that Warner did not have rights to the material. Bootlegs of Läther soon appeared. Some came directly from the test pressing, but most were lower quality ones sourced from broadcast tapes. Until the album's official release in 1996 the bootlegs circulated widely.

Eventually, Warner issued all four individual albums starting in March 1978 and running through May of 1979. However, the label censored the 1978 version of Zappa in New York by removing the song Punky's Whips as well as other references to Punky Meadows, a member of the American glam rock band Angel. The change of album title from ""Hot Rats III"" to ""Sleep Dirt"" and editing of the material were also done in violation of Zappa's contract. Since Zappa had supplied only the tapes for the final three albums they were released without musician or songwriting credits. Also, the artwork for these albums was not approved by Zappa. Instead, Warner commissioned the designs from cartoonist Gary Panter. All four individual albums went out of print when the DiscReet/Warner distribution agreement ended in 1982. 

 CD issues 
After contracts with Warner and DiscReet expired Zappa chose to re-issue the four previously released individual albums on CD in 1991 along with the Panter artwork and added credits. Each of them were either remixed and or altered in various ways. The 1991 releases appeared in the US on Zappa's Barking Pumpkin label. 

In 1995 Rykodisc again reissued Zappa's entire catalog up to that date. None of the four albums related to Läther were altered from the original CD issues, though new analog to digital transfers were made.

One year later, Läther was released officially through Rykodisc as a three-CD album. This edition used new 1996 artwork and was released in a plastic jewel case. Gail Zappa confirmed that the stereo master tapes for the four-LP Läther box were used as the source. While Zappa's notes from the tape boxes show a slightly different track listing, the 1996 CD version of Läther is musically identical to the 1977 test pressings. The only difference is that four bonus tracks were also added. Among these is commentary from Zappa taken from his KROQ broadcast. Also, the title of the song ""One More Time for the World"" was changed to ""The Ocean is the Ultimate Solution"", the title under which the same song appears on the album Sleep Dirt.

Along with most of Zappa's material, a ""mini-LP"" CD edition was also released by Rykodisc in Japan, with the artwork reformatted to resemble the packaging of a vinyl album.

In December 2012 an official reissue of Läther appeared in cardboard packaging with the original intended 1977 artwork. This version omits the 1996 bonus tracks.

 Release and reception 

The official version of Läther was finally released with the authorization of Gail Zappa in September 1996, nearly three years after Frank's death.

It is still debated as to whether Zappa had conceived the material as a four-LP box set from the beginning, or only later when working with Phonogram around September-October 1977. In the liner notes to the 1996 release, Gail states that ""As originally conceived by Frank, Läther was always a 4-record box set."" Despite this claim, however, there is no evidence that Zappa ever delivered the four-LP Läther set to Warner, only the four individual albums. Zappa himself actually contradicted Gail's posthumous claims that Warner had broken up Läther into other albums. Several interviews published in 1978 and an album review from 1996 explicitly state that Zappa re-edited the four individual albums into the Läther four-LP box and then presented it to Phonogram. 

In a January 1978 Zappa interview the British publication New Musical Express'' said:
""Since his (Warner) contract had allegedly been breached, Zappa took his copy tapes of the four albums, added some new material, subtracted some old, and prepared a four-record set called ""Läther"", but pronounced ""Leather"".

Allmusic writer Richie Unterberger praised the album, but wrote that it would ""appeal far more to the Zappa cultist than the general listener, though the Zappa cult – which has been craving Läther in its original format for years – is a pretty wide fan base in and of itself.""

205,17251496,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KJAE,KJAE,"KJAE (93.5 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format. Licensed to Leesville, Louisiana, United States, the station serves  Vernon Parish and surrounding areas from a studio located in Leesville, Louisiana.  The station is currently owned by Pene Broadcasting Company, Inc .

The station broadcasts occasionally using the syndicated Westwood One Real Country format during non-locally produced times. It is also broadcasts syndicated LSU sports over the air.  The station is an affiliate of the New Orleans Saints radio network.

History

In late 1975, ownership of KLLA, a 1000 watt AM commercial broadcasting station in Leesville, La., was passed from the station's original builder & owner, Irving Ward Steinman of Alexandria, La. to Pene Broadcasting Co. of Leesville, La.  The company was headed by the station's new General Manager, Nick J. Pollacia, Jr. (The name ""Pene"" was chosen because it was the name of Nick Pollacia, Jr's sister) Pene Broadcasting is a family owned organization, and at the time of KLLA's purchase, plans were also being simultaneously made to build a completely new FM radio station for the Leesville, and Vernon Parish broadcasting area.  That station was to become KJAE.

In early 1980 the station was granted a FCC permit to begin construction of a Class 'A' FM station with a licensed power originally of 3,000 watts broadcasting at 92.7 on the FM dial. Later in the 1980s KJAE's frequency would be changed by the FCC to 93.5.

Planning for the new FM station had been handled out of the original broadcast facilities of KJAE's older sister station KLLA. However that original station's location was deemed too small to support the new studio and control facilities necessary for both KLLA and KJAE, so a new physical plant building was constructed.  This building was separate but also located at the same site as the older building. The original station building still stands today, and is used as a storage facility.

The new facility was much larger building and more than doubled the original space of the older station. It was one that could more comfortably contain both of the two stations broadcast & production studios, and transmitter & equipment control rooms, as well as offices for management, sales and engineering.(two stations operated separately in one building) Anticipatory construction on the facilities had begun in late 1979, and so, final construction on the FM portion was completed in late summer of 1980.

Actual first broadcast operations for KJAE began in the fall of 1980 with the grant of the first FCC license to broadcast. The original KLLA had operated for years with a basically split format that was basically country music in the morning at sign on, and then rock & popular music from noon to sign off, with Christian programming on Sunday mornings. However KJAE had always been meant to be programmed entirely as a country station from sign on to sign off. So when KJAE signed on the air in early 1980, KLLA became a rock music station all day from sign on to sign off. Thus the two stations served the two dominant mainstream forms of music for Leesville & Vernon Parish.  Very popular morning and afternoon shows were created, as well as frequent mobile onsite remote broadcasts that are popular to this day.  Pollacia inaugurated the very well received and popular seasonal broadcasts of the football games of the Leesville High School Wampus Cats, whether they were home games or away, they were also broadcast by remote.

In the mid 70's, just prior to the dawn of live syndicated broadcasting via satellite link, a new form of syndicated all-day programming had been introduced. With this automated format it was possible for two stations operating out of one building to more or less be handled by one staff member. This System operated by using an early form of computerized automation system to control four large 10.5"" 2-track open reel to reel tape decks, two commercial holding rotating carousels for carts, a voice tape/music tape synchronizer and an early computer system to control the entire system.  The hardware system itself was marketed by SMC, or the Sono-Mag Corporation. But it needed the separate all important programming itself, and this was the Top American Country programming created for these automation systems by Century 21 Productions of Dallas, Tx.

Each week a large box arrived via priority mail at the station that contained new 10.5 inch large reel tapes. Two would have the new current & upcoming hits on them in different combinations of two together, and another two reels would have a ""Recurrent"" reel that was music that had just fallen off the charts recently, and an oldie tape and then the all-important voice track tapes.  It was all very organized to program an entire week, 24 hours a day. A 7-day printed set of pages showed exactly where each song on the different decks would be rotated onto the air. Voice tapes ran just like live DJs, and they used these same schedules to record their voice tracks. One 'DJ' would come on for four hours for each section of the day starting at 0600 each day. Century 21 used some of the biggest names in country music radio DJs from across the country to record these tapes.  The automated synchronizer and the SMC system carried out a good deal of the days programming, while KLLA itself remained live with separate DJs for its broadcast day.

Immediately after going on the air at 0600, KJAE went live for three hours until 0900, and it was the first morning radio show in Vernon Parish that was done live.  It had been started on KLLA by owner/manager Nick Pollacia, and when KJAE came on line it transferred over to that new station. The incredibly popular program ""Swap Shop"" was also created by Mr. Pollacia on KLLA airing at 0900 in the morning, and after transferring to KJAE, has continued non-stop to this day.  It remains a regular favorite with listeners.

The automated programming on KJAE was only done until around 1983 or so. Then it was done live for some years until the readily available live satellite programming was used to fill the parts of the night & day when the station was not actually live.  Many segments of the day are currently done live.

Mr. Pollacia left the station in the mid 80's to pursue other opportunities. The day-to-day operation and the station's management was passed into the capable hands of his sister, Mrs. Pene Scoggins. She remains the station's longest active employee/owner, having had a strong influence in the day-to-day operations of both stations since their ownership began in 1975.
  
On January 20, 2000, the station upgraded to its current facilities of 7,500 watts (however, the station jokes about upgrading to 500,000 watts on its website).

210,16512252,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamina%2C%20Texas,"Tamina, Texas","Tamina  is an unincorporated community in southern Montgomery County, Texas, United States.

Tamina is located along the Missouri Pacific line, located  east of Interstate 45 and  south of the city of Conroe.

James H. Berry promoted the community and named it after Tammany Hall, New York City. The letter writer submitting the name to the postal department spelled the name ""Tamina."" The name is pronounced ""Tammany"" by some of the community's older residents.

History
The founding of Tamina can be traced back to 1871, when freedmen in the area helped construct the Houston and Great Northern Railroad. The town became known as ""Tamina"" in 1897 when the name was submitted for the building of the community's first post office.

In the early 1900s, the community survived mostly through its connection with the lumber industry, particularly after the establishment of the Grogan-Cochran Lumber Company's Tamina Mill in 1917. The population of the area dwindled to 50 after the Tamina Mill was closed in 1927.   The post office closed in the late 1930s, followed by the town's black school in 1949. At that time, Tamina students attended Booker T. Washington School in Conroe.

Public Sewer Service
Over the past 50 years, the area surrounding Tamina has undergone significant development, leading to the incorporation of the adjacent cities of Shenandoah in 1974 and Oak Ridge North in 1979. As a result, Tamina became the only community in the area without urban infrastructure, most notably a public sewerage. Most residents of Tamina rely on septic tanks for sewage disposal, while a few residents make use of the more expensive aerobic treatment system for their homes.

The first attempt in the early 2000s to install a public sewerage system, a collaborative project with Oak Ridge North, failed after Tamina residents refused the terms of a Texas Water Development Board loan which would have required Tamina to give up certain rights over usage of the water.

A second attempt at establishing a public sewerage system was initiated in 2006-2007 between Tamina and the City of Shenandoah. The United States Department of Agriculture offered a loan to Tamina for the construction of a public sewerage system on the condition that Tamina find a municipality willing to treat the sewage. Shenandoah eventually backed out of the deal because the loan also prohibits Shenandoah from annexing Tamina until the debt is repaid. While Shenandoah is not currently populous enough under current state law to annex territory, population growth projections estimate that Shenandoah will pass the requisite 5000 person threshold by 2030.

Demographics
Because Tamina is an unincorporated community, the United States Census does not collect demographic data specific only to the Tamina community, but rather divides the Tamina area among three larger census tracts. As a result, estimates of Tamina's population vary, ranging from 200 to 1000.  With its history as a freedmen's town, most of the residents of the community are African-American. Many residents have been living in the community for multiple generations, with some residents tracing their ancestry back to the beginning of the community.

Education
The community is within the Conroe Independent School District.

The area is divided between the attendance zones of Oak Ridge Elementary School and Houser Elementary School.

The following schools serve all of the Tamina area.
Vogel Intermediate School

Vale de Almeida was Ambassador of the European Union to the United Nations from 2015 to 2019 and Ambassador of the European Union to the United States from 2010 to 2014. He was appointed “the first head of the future EU delegation to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” on 1 February 2020.

Biography

Vale de Almeida read history at the University of Lisbon before pursuing further studies in journalism and management in France, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. After working as a journalist for seven years, in 1982 he joined the European Commission delegation in Lisbon.

During his time in the Commission he worked under Presidents Jacques Delors, Jacques Santer, Romano Prodi and  José Manuel Barroso. Under Santer, in 1995, he became deputy chief spokesman for the EC. In 1997 he was promoted Director for Information, Communication, Culture and Audiovisual.

When EC President Romano Prodi took office in 1999, Vale de Almeida was a member of his transition team before being nominated as director for Education and Culture.

Between 2004 and 2009, Vale de Almeida was the Head of Cabinet (Chief of staff and principal adviser) for EC President José Manuel Barroso. He accompanied Barroso in all European Council meetings and ensured coordination with the private offices of Heads of State and Government in all 28 Member States of the EU. He was also the President’s Personal Representative for the negotiations on the Treaty of Lisbon and acted as his personal representative (sherpa) for G8 and G20 summits.

From November 2009 until July 2010 he served as Director-General for External Relations of the European Commission.

Vale de Almeida then served as the first Ambassador of the European Union to the United States of America, from 2010 to 2014, after the Treaty of Lisbon increased the delegation's powers to speak for the whole of the EU (previously, they represented only the Commission). In Washington, he actively engaged in strengthening EU/U.S. relations and was critical to the launching of negotiations of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP).

From 2015 to 2019, Vale de Almeida was the European Union Ambassador to the United Nations.

Since February 1 2020, Vale de Almeida has been the European Union's Ambassador to the UK and has been recognised by the UK as an Ambassador as of 5 May 2021.

Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the ""highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety"" along with ""the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership"" as well as ""commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility"".

The status of Chartered Physicist was introduced in 1985 following approval from the Privy Council. It was originally granted  automatically with corporate membership of the Institute of Physics (IoP). Reform of the membership structure in 1998 saw Chartered Physicist established as a separate qualification from 2001 that could be gained either alongside or after the status of Member or Fellow of the IoP. In order to gain the qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or MPhys integrated master's degree is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies. For physicists gaining the status from 2012, revalidation through proof of continuing professional development is required every three years. 

Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to Chartered Engineer, which the IoP also awards as a member of the Engineering Council UK, and other chartered statuses in the UK. It is also considered a ""regulated profession"" under the European professional qualification directives.

217,46894342,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf%20Abu%20Durra,Yusuf Abu Durra,"Yusuf Sa'id Abu Durra (1900 – 1940) (nom de guerre: Abu Abed) was one of the chief Palestinian Arab rebel commanders during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine. Abu Durra was a close disciple of the Muslim preacher and rebel Izz ad-Din al-Qassam and one of the few survivors of a shootout between British forces and Qassam, in which the latter was killed. When the revolt broke out, Abu Durra led bands of Qassam's remaining disciples and other armed volunteers in the region between Haifa and Jenin. He also administered a rebel court system in his areas of operation, which prosecuted and executed several Palestinian village headmen suspected of colluding with the British authorities. After experiencing battlefield setbacks, Abu Durra escaped to Transjordan, but was arrested on his way back to Palestine in 1939. He was subsequently tried later that year and executed by the authorities in 1940.

Early life and work
Abu Durra was born during the Ottoman era, in 1900, in the village of Silat al-Harithiya, located near Jenin in Jabal Nablus (Samarian highlands). He hailed from the Jaradat clan, which at the time was part of a larger confederation of clans and tribes in Palestine and Transjordan known as the Qais. The Qais also included the Tuqan and Jarrar clans, and the Bani Saqr tribe.

During the period when the British administered Palestine, Abu Durra worked as a porter at a railway station in Zikhron Ya'akov. Later, he became a day laborer in the port city of Haifa, working with the Iraqi Petroleum Company.

Early activism
During his time in Haifa, he became a close disciple of the Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-British rebel Izz ad-Din al-Qassam. As part of his efforts against British rule, Abu Durra actively sought recruits to join an armed struggle led by al-Qassam.

When the British authorities believed al-Qassam was responsible for the killing of a British police officer, they set out to arrest him. Al-Qassam and twelve of his close supporters (known as ""Qassamiyun"" or ""Qassamites""), including Abu Durra, evaded the authorities for a time before being cornered in the hills near Ya'bad in October 1935. The men refused to surrender and opened fire at the besieging British troops; in the ensuing firefight, al-Qassam and three of his men were killed and five arrested, but Abu Durra managed to escape the area.

Regional commander in 1936 revolt

The 1935 confrontation served as a prelude to a countrywide revolt against the British by Palestinian Arabs that broke out in 1936. Abu Durra emerged as one of the major Qassamite commanders of rebels, particularly after the death of commander Ahmad Attiyah Awad in March 1938. Subsequently, Abu Durra assumed the latter's position as the main commander of the region extending from Haifa to Jenin. He eventually became one of four regional commanders of the revolt, the other three being Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir of the Upper Galilee, Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad of the Tulkarm area, and Aref Abd al-Razziq of Arraba. These four commanders were appointed by the Damascus-based Central Committee of National Jihad in Palestine to form the Bureau of the Arab Revolt in Palestine, which was meant to increase coordination among the disparate rebel factions and the exiled Palestinian leaders serving on the Central Committee.

Like other local rebel leaders, Abu Durra organized his forces into a relatively small core of semi-permanent fighters and non-permanent, volunteer-based bands (fasa'il; sing. fasil) headed by local commanders subordinate to the main commander. The fasa'il normally launched nighttime attacks and were often used by Abu Durra for specific operations. His core unit was based in the vicinity of Haifa and he presided over 17 fasa'il, totaling an estimated 250 fighters. His second-in-command was Yusuf Hamdan, who commanded a fasil in the Umm al-Fahm area.

Abu Durra entered into confrontations with the Druze of Mount Carmel due to a number of factors. His earlier recruitment effort to enlist Druze fighters in Haifa was relatively unsuccessful, and his demand for financial contributions from the Mount Carmel villages to purchase 30 rifles were rebuffed. There was also a general suspicion among the rebels that the Druze sheikhs (chiefs) of Mount Carmel were cooperating with the authorities against their cause. In early October 1938, Abu Durra led two successive assaults against the villages of Isfiya and Daliyat al-Karmil. Three Druze men were killed and some local Druze sheikhs were taken prisoner. The rebels also allegedly desecrated Druze religious texts.

Due in part to an alert sent by the Druze residents of Mount Carmel following an attack by Abu Durra in late November 1938, the British Army launched an ambush on his men, while they were on their way to their Umm al-Fahm headquarters. The ensuing engagement became known as the ""Battle of Umm al-Zinat [or Umm al-Daraj]"", due to its location outside of the village of Umm al-Zinat, which was situated in the southern foothills of Mount Carmel. The British force numbered over a thousand and were backed by 13 fighter planes, while the rebel force was considerably smaller. Abu Durra was wounded and 43 of his fighters were killed, but he managed to escape.

Head of Haifa rebels court
In the course of the revolt, Abu Durra headed a rebel court in his areas of operation, which were the vicinity of Haifa, Mount Carmel, Wadi Ara, and the Jezreel Valley. The court dealt with issues that ranged from suspected treachery to petty crimes. Abu Durra gained a reputation for ordering the deaths of suspected collaborators among Palestinian village headmen (makhatir, sing. mukhtar). According to interviews conducted by historian Ted Swedenberg of former Palestinian rebels and civilians who lived during the revolt, offhand estimates of the number of makhatir Abu Durra ordered to be executed ranged from around 20 to 85. However, the latter figure was considered ""fantastical"" by Swedenberg.

The memoirs of Palestinian historian Izzat Darwaza mention an anecdote in which a British citizen pressed the Haifa Magistrates' Court to speed up the recovery of her stolen jewelry from known suspects, was told by the judge that her request would take time and that she might have better luck with Abu Durra's court. Although the judge made the latter suggestion in jest, the woman did go to one of Abu Durra's courts in Ein al-Sahala with the suspects' names; one week later she was summoned back to the court, where her jewelry was restored to her.

Arrest and execution
In 1939, as the revolt was close to being suppressed, Abu Durra departed Palestine for Damascus. Sometime later, he set out for Hashemite Transjordan. On 24 July, while he was traveling in the eastern Jordan Valley, apparently with the intention of returning to Palestine, he was arrested by the Arab Legion headed by British general John Glubb Pasha. According to Glubb, he was dressed in civilian attire, but had in his possession a military uniform and a ""rebel order of battle"". He was subsequently detained in a prison in al-Karak until being extradited to Palestine. Abu Durra's arrest and extradition were unpopular among the people of Transjordan and as his convoy passed through various towns on its way to Palestine, it was surrounded by crowds cheering for him. 

Abu Durra was tried and sentenced to death for ordering the assassinations of thirty-eight mukhtars on 4–5 January 1939. The mukhtars had been sentenced to death in absentia by rebel courts run by Abu Durra's subordinates. They were charged with selling land illegally, land speculation and collaborating with the British government and Jewish institutions. During the operation, four mukhtars and a prominent rural leader were killed, six mukhtars were wounded, while the remainder had been warned and sought safety. The assassinations of the local leaders contributed to the growing split between the Palestinian Arab public and the rebel leadership. Abu Durra was executed in 1940. According to the memoirs of British Mandatory police officer Geoffrey Morton, Abu Durra walked to his death with his head held high. He was considered a martyr by his supporters, and during the 1970s, a Palestine Liberation Organization unit that launched raids into Israel was named after him.

218,2515416,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwell%2C%20Nottinghamshire,"Southwell, Nottinghamshire","Southwell (, ) is a town in the district of Newark and Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, England. It includes Southwell Minster, the cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham. A population of under 7,000 rose to 7,297 at the 2011 Census, and was put at 6,853 in 2019. The origin of the name is unclear. It lies on the River Greet, about 14 miles (22 km) north-east of Nottingham. Other historic buildings include prebendal houses in Church Street and Westgate and the Methodist church, which has a right of way beneath it, so that the upper floor seats more than the lower. The workhouse (1824) was a prototype for many others. Owned by the National Trust, it shows its appearance in the 19th century. Behind the Minster is a partly ruined palace, once a residence of the Archbishop of York. It includes the recently restored State Chamber, Cardinal Wolsey's former dining room, and gardens among the ruins.

Toponymy
The origin of the name is unclear. Several sites claim to be the original ""well"", notably at GR  where a plaque has been placed; in the Admiral Rodney pub; on the south side of the Minster, known as Lady Well in the 19th century; and one by the cloisters called Holy Well. Norwell, eight miles north-west, may support the idea of a pair of ""south"" and ""north"" wells.

Early history
The remains of an opulent Roman villa were excavated beneath the Minster and its churchyard in 1959. Part of a mural from the excavation is displayed in the Minster. It is one of three of its type found in the territories of the Corieltauvi (or Coritani) tribes – along with Scampton in Lincolnshire and Norfolk Street in Leicestershire. A stretch of the Fosse Way runs on the far bank of the River Trent, with evidence of Roman settlement at Ad Pontem (""to the bridge"" or ""at the bridge""), north-west of the village of East Stoke. There is no clear evidence of a road between Ad Pontem and Southwell. Other evidence of Roman settlement includes the use of Roman bricks in prebendary buildings around the Minster, remains of a ditch or fosse discovered at Burgage Hill in the 19th century, and possibly Roman remains beneath the Church Street site of the recently vacated Minster School.

The Venerable Bede records a multiple baptism in the ""flood of the Trent"" near ""Tiovulginacester"" by Paulinus in the presence of Edwin of Northumbria, whom he had converted to Christianity in 627. There is disagreement on the location of Tiovulginacester, but Paulinus certainly visited it and may have founded the first church in Southwell.

Remains of Eadburh, Abbess of Repton and daughter of Ealdwulf of East Anglia were buried in Southwell's Saxon church. Eadburh was appointed Abbess under the patronage of King Wulfhere of Mercia. She appears in the Life of Guthlac and is thought to have died about AD 700. Her remains were buried or translated to Southwell Minster, and revered there in the Middle Ages. The only reference is in a Pilgrims Guide to Shrines and Burial Places of the Saints of England supposedly written in 1000: ""There resteth St. Eadburh in the Minster of Southwell near the water called the Trent.""

Eadwy of England gave land in Southwell to Oskytel, Archbishop of York, in 956, this charter being the first dated reference to Southwell. In 1051 Archbishop Ælfric Puttoc died at Southwell, which indicates that the archiepiscopal residence and church might have been established by then. A tessellated floor and the 11th-century tympanum over a doorway in the north transept are evidence of construction of the Minster after this time. The Domesday Book (1086) gives detail of an archiepiscopal manor in Southwell.

A custom known as the ""Gate to Southwell"" originated after 1109, when the Archbishop of York, Thomas I, wrote to each Nottinghamshire parish for contributions to building of a new mother church. Annually at Whitsuntide, the resulting ""Southwell Pence"" were taken to the Minster in a procession from Nottingham, headed by the Mayor and followed by clergy and lay people bound for Southwell's Whitsun Fair. The Pence were paid at the Minster's north porch to the Chapter Clerk. The ""gate"" in the name of Southwell Gate means ""street"", as in many East Midland and North-Eastern street names. The custom in its original form persisted well into the 16th century. It was revived in 1981 by the Dolphin Morrismen, but imposition of traffic-management costs forced the organisers to abandon it in 2014. It is survived by the Gate to Southwell Festival, a broad musical event held every early June since 2007 on a site near Southwell and at various venues in the town.

Geoffrey Plantagenet was ordained a priest at Southwell in 1189. On 4 April 1194, Richard I and the King of Scots, William I, were in Southwell, having spent Palm Sunday in Clipstone. King John visited Southwell between 1207 and 1213, ostensibly to hunt in Sherwood Forest, but also on the way to expedition to Wales in 1212.

1300–1800
The Saracen's Head was built in 1463 on land gifted in 1396 by Archbishop Thomas Arundel of York to John and Margaret Fysher. When built, the first floor overhung the roadway in the style of the time.

In 1603, James VI of Scotland passed through Southwell on his way to London to be crowned King James I.

In the English Civil War, King Charles I spent his last night as a free man in May 1646 in the Saracen's Head (then the King's Head), before surrendering to the Scottish Army stationed at nearby Kelham. The town, the Minster and the Archbishop's Palace suffered under Oliver Cromwell's troops, as they sequestered the palace to stable their horses, broke monuments, and ransacked graves for lead and other valuables. In 1793, there were still iron rings in the walls to secure the horses. By end of the war the Archbishop's Palace was in ruins apart from its Great Hall. It is reputed that Cromwell also stayed at the King's Head.

A Bridewell built on the Burgage in 1656 was enlarged in 1787 to become a county prison. There is evidence that a house of correction was built in 1611, so that the Bridewell may itself have been an enlargement. Mary Ann Brailsford of apple fame (see below) was baptised at Southwell in May 1791, and Matthew Bramley in 1796 in Balderton.

19th century and later
By 1801 the population was 2,305. In 1803, Lord Byron stayed with his mother in Burgage Manor during holidays from Harrow and Cambridge. His mother rented the house. By that time he had become 6th Baron Byron of Rochdale, but the family home, Newstead Abbey, still required repairs, which they could not afford.

Southwell today
As the site of an Anglican cathedral, the town is sometimes taken as a city and was treated as such in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. However, its city status is not recognised by the government. Southwell has an active Town Council.

The town is something of an oddity in North Nottinghamshire, being visibly affluent compared with neighbouring Newark-on-Trent and Mansfield. Agriculture and coal have seen the fortunes of the other two fluctuate over the years, while Southwell has remained a place where wealthier Nottinghamians like to reside. It appeared in the Sunday Times shortlist of Best Places to Live 2017 for the Midlands region.

In most of Nottinghamshire, Southwell is pronounced SUH-thull, with a voiced ""th"" and a silent ""w"". Southwell's own residents tend to pronounce it as it is spelt.

The Town Council, since the 2019 elections, consists of eight Liberal Democrat councillors, four Conservatives and two Independents. The Council Chair was held in 2019–2021 by Mrs Lyn Harris (Lib. Dem.) and since then by Sally Reynolds (Independent). The Chair of the Town Environment Committee is Peter Harris, that of the Governance and Finance Committee Martin Stott and that of the Planning Committee Peter Scorer (all three Lib. Dem.) The town and surrounding villages and hamlets are represented as District Councillors by Malcolm Brock (Lib. Dem.), Peter Harris (Lib. Dem.) and Penny Rainbow (Con.)

The town's two infant schools (aged 3–5) are Southwell Holy Trinity C of E and Lowes Wong . The latter also teaches children aged 7–11. The local secondary school is Southwell Minster School, which also educates the choristers of the Minster and gifted musicians in its Junior Department. It has particularly good GCSE and AS/A level results for Nottinghamshire.

The Bramley cooking apple was first seeded in Southwell, by Mary Ann Brailsford in 1809. Henry Merryweather, a local nurseryman then 17 years old, saw potential and cultivated it from cuttings. The apple is widely used and renowned for its acidic taste and for cooking into a smooth purée. One local football club, Southwell City, is nicknamed ""The Bramleys"" and the town's new library and youth centre are termed the Bramley Centre. In March 2009, a stained-glass window was placed in Southwell Minister to mark the apple's bicentenary.

The local community newspaper is The Bramley, of which some 11,200 copies a month are delivered free in and around Southwell.

Sports clubs include Southwell Rugby Club (known as the Redmen), formed in 1922–1923. In the 2011–2012 season, it won a historic treble as RFU Midlands 4 (East) North League Champions, Nottinghamshire Junior Cup winners and Nottinghamshire/Lincolnshire/Derbyshire Plate winners. There is also a Southwell Cricket Club. Southwell City Football Club, an FA Charter Standard Community Club, involves over 400 local players in 35 teams aged five years to veteran.

Southwell has a leisure centre run by a local trust, with trustees from the community, although the district council also provides limited support.

The annual Southwell Music Festival is held every August in Southwell Minster and other nearby venues. The Gate to Southwell Festival of roots and acoustic music is held each year in early June.

Southwell Racecourse, owned by the Arena Racing Company, is situated on the outskirts of the town near Fiskerton and has an all-weather track. It hosts jump and flat racing.

The town is linked to Newark and Nottingham by the A612, although this has now been downgraded to a C road, and to north Nottingham and villages to the west by B6386. The A617 primary route passes 2 miles north of the town in Hockerton, and the A1 and A46 trunk routes are 7 miles away in Newark. The railway station at the nearby village of Fiskerton has gained a small car park in recent years to cater for Southwell commuters. Southwell is also served by Nottingham City Transport's rural Pathfinder 26 service to Nottingham and Stagecoach East Midlands (Mansfield) service to Mansfield and Newark. There are other infrequent services to nearby villages.

The town is twinned with Sées in France,, Sarzana in Italy, and Český Brod in the Czech Republic.

The historic town centre is based around the cathedral area, but nearby outlying communities grew and eventually were subsumed into the town.

 The Prebendage was the heart of Southwell centred on the Minster and the surrounding prebendary properties
 Burgage was north of the cathedral, around Burgage Green, traditionally hosting burgage properties
 Hightown was to the north west along Westgate, along the main shopping street
 East Thorpe and West Thorpe were hamlets on either side of these areas, St Catherine's Well, at the extremity of West Thorpe, was formerly noted for treating rheumatism.

Localities 
Separated further afield from the core urban area, but within the parish are the following places:

 Normanton, a hamlet on the east side of the River Greet positioned around Corkhill Lane, it hosts a sizeable garden centre business
 Maythorne, an area based around a former silk mill north of the town, alongside the River Greet
 Brackenhurst, an agricultural campus for Nottingham Trent University, is to the south
 Brinkley is a hamlet to the south east along Fiskerton Road.

Bus services

Railway stations
Southwell was previously served by a branch line which ran from Rolleston Junction to Mansfield. There was a station on the line which served the town. It was opened in 1847, but closed to passengers in 1959 and to goods traffic in 1964. The station survives as a private residence. The trackbed towards Mansfield is now the Southwell Trail. The trackbed to Rolleston Junction is now covered by housing within the town and goes on to form a private access road from Southwell to Southwell Racecourse. Today, the nearest station to the town is over two miles away in Fiskerton, although Rolleston Junction is also near the racecourse. Both stations offer a service between Matlock, Lincoln, Leicester, Newark-on-Trent, Derby and Nottingham.

Education
Secondary education in the town is predominantly provided by The Minster School, which still educates choristers of Southwell Minster. The Minster School is a Specialist College for Humanities and Music and was rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2011/2012. Pupils may also choose to attend school at Newark-on-Trent, which is about a 20-minute drive east. The School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences is part of Nottingham Trent University. and offers further and higher education courses in agricultural-related subjects at its Brackenhurst campus just outside Southwell.

For example, many people consider a market in human organs to be a repugnant market or the ability to bet on terrorist acts in prediction market to be repugnant.  Others consider the lack of such markets to be even more immoral and uncaring, as trade bans (e.g. in organ transplants and terrorism information) can create avoidable human suffering.

Nobel Laureate Alvin Roth (2007) ""introduced in the economics literature the concept of “repugnance” for a transaction as the aversion toward other individuals engaging in it, even if the parties directly involved benefit from that trade (i.e. “There are some things no one should be allowed to do”). Repugnance considerations have important consequences on the types of markets and transactions that we observe and, as such, they impose a challenge for policy and market design.""

Examples

The repugnance of markets varies according to time, culture, and economic development, among other factors.  Slavery is a market currently considered repugnant while for most of recorded history before circa 1000 AD it was considered acceptable, and was still considered acceptable against certain people groups until circa 1800 AD.  Examples of markets considered repugnant at one time or place include:
Pregnancy/early childhood
 Abortion
 Adoption

225,51105640,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%20North%20Regional%20Force,Green North Regional Force,"Green North Regional Force (, FRNV) was a Chilean regionalist political party active only in the Coquimbo Region. It was legally constituted by the Electoral Service of Chile between 2015 and 2017.

History
It was founded on October 26, 2015 (as recorded in the public deed issued on 22 December 2015 in the Official Journal of the Republic of Chile to establish its constitution) by various split personalities of the New Majority disenchanted with the government of Michelle Bachelet. The founders of the party made the decision after Bachelet replace the Intendant of the Region of Coquimbo Hanne Utreras (current vice president of the party) by Claudio Ibáñez. The creation of the party had the support of prominent political figures in the region, as the deputy Sergio Gahona (UDI).

In its statement, Green North Regional Force claims to be a regionalist and progressive party, whose primary focus is the human being and its rights. Their registration was initially rejected on 4 July 2016 by failing to reach the minimum of signatures required, however on July 13 the errors were corrected and the party was finally registered legally by the Electoral Service in the Region of Coquimbo.

The party will participate in the municipal elections of 2016, in which the party would provide support for the candidates for mayor in Combarbalá (Gustavo Hernandez), La Serena (Hanne Utreras), Punitaqui (Pedro Valdivia) and Río Hurtado (Edgar Ángel). It also will submit lists of candidates for councilors in all municipalities of the Region of Coquimbo.

Despite being active only in the Region of Coquimbo, the party aims to expand to other regions in the future. It has also announced that it will present candidates in parliamentary elections and regional councilors to be held in 2017.

In January 2017, the party agreed to merge with the Regional and Popular Front, the Social Agrarian Regionalist Independent Movement, and We Are Aysén to form the Social Green Regionalist Federation (Federación Regionalista Verde Social, FREVS). It was officially dissolved on April 25, 2017, when the constitution of the FREVS was legalized.

228,4031859,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q%20plot,Q–Q plot,"In statistics, a Q–Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. First, the set of intervals for the quantiles is chosen. A point  on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution (-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution (-coordinate). Thus the line is a parametric curve with the parameter which is the number of the interval for the quantile.

If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on the line .  If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line .  Q–Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a location-scale family of distributions.

A Q–Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions.  Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or theoretical distributions.  The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data can be viewed as a non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions.  A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing histograms of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret.  Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model. This can provide an assessment of ""goodness of fit"" that is graphical, rather than reducing to a numerical summary.  Q–Q plots are also used to compare two theoretical distributions to each other. Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a scatter plot, or even for the numbers of values in the two groups being compared to be equal.

The term ""probability plot"" sometimes refers specifically to a Q–Q plot, sometimes to a more general class of plots, and sometimes to the less commonly used P–P plot. The probability plot correlation coefficient plot (PPCC plot) is a quantity derived from the idea of Q–Q plots, which measures the agreement of a fitted distribution with observed data and which is sometimes used as a means of fitting a distribution to data.

Definition and construction 

A Q–Q plot is a plot of the quantiles of two distributions against each other, or a plot based on estimates of the quantiles.  The pattern of points in the plot is used to compare the two distributions.

The main step in constructing a Q–Q plot is calculating or estimating the quantiles to be plotted.  If one or both of the axes in a Q–Q plot is based on a theoretical distribution with a continuous cumulative distribution function (CDF), all quantiles are uniquely defined and can be obtained by inverting the CDF.  If a theoretical probability distribution with a discontinuous CDF is one of the two distributions being compared, some of the quantiles may not be defined, so an interpolated quantile may be plotted.  If the Q–Q plot is based on data, there are multiple quantile estimators in use.  Rules for forming Q–Q plots when quantiles must be estimated or interpolated are called plotting positions.

A simple case is where one has two data sets of the same size. In that case, to make the Q–Q plot, one orders each set in increasing order, then pairs off and plots the corresponding values. A more complicated construction is the case where two data sets of different sizes are being compared.  To construct the Q–Q plot in this case, it is necessary to use an interpolated quantile estimate so that quantiles corresponding to the same underlying probability can be constructed.

More abstractly, given two cumulative probability distribution functions  and , with associated quantile functions  and  (the inverse function of the CDF is the quantile function), the Q–Q plot draws the -th quantile of  against the -th quantile of  for a range of values of .  Thus, the Q–Q plot is a parametric curve indexed over [0,1] with values in the real plane .

Interpretation 
The points plotted in a Q–Q plot are always non-decreasing when viewed from left to right.  If the two distributions being compared are identical, the Q–Q plot follows the 45° line .  If the two distributions agree after linearly transforming the values in one of the distributions, then the Q–Q plot follows some line, but not necessarily the line .  If the general trend of the Q–Q plot is flatter than the line , the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the vertical axis.  Conversely, if the general trend of the Q–Q plot is steeper than the line , the distribution plotted on the vertical axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis.  Q–Q plots are often arced, or ""S"" shaped, indicating that one of the distributions is more skewed than the other, or that one of the distributions has heavier tails than the other.

Although a Q–Q plot is based on quantiles, in a standard Q–Q plot it is not possible to determine which point in the Q–Q plot determines a given quantile.  For example, it is not possible to determine the median of either of the two distributions being compared by inspecting the Q–Q plot.  Some Q–Q plots indicate the deciles to make determinations such as this possible.

The intercept and slope of a linear regression between the quantiles gives a measure of the relative location and relative scale of the samples. If the median of the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is 0, the intercept of a regression line is a measure of location, and the slope is a measure of scale. The distance between medians is another measure of relative location reflected in a Q–Q plot.  The ""probability plot correlation coefficient"" (PPCC plot) is the correlation coefficient between the paired sample quantiles.  The closer the correlation coefficient is to one, the closer the distributions are to being shifted, scaled versions of each other.  For distributions with a single shape parameter, the probability plot correlation coefficient plot provides a method for estimating the shape parameter – one simply computes the correlation coefficient for different values of the shape parameter, and uses the one with the best fit, just as if one were comparing distributions of different types.

Another common use of Q–Q plots is to compare the distribution of a sample to a theoretical distribution, such as the standard normal distribution , as in a normal probability plot.  As in the case when comparing two samples of data, one orders the data (formally, computes the order statistics), then plots them against certain quantiles of the theoretical distribution.

Plotting positions 
The choice of quantiles from a theoretical distribution can depend upon context and purpose. One choice, given a sample of size , is  for , as these are the quantiles that the sampling distribution realizes. The last of these, , corresponds to the 100th percentile – the maximum value of the theoretical distribution, which is sometimes infinite. Other choices are the use of  , or instead to space the points evenly in the uniform distribution, using .

Many other choices have been suggested, both formal and heuristic, based on theory or simulations relevant in context. The following subsections discuss some of these. A narrower question is choosing a maximum (estimation of a population maximum), known as the German tank problem, for which similar ""sample maximum, plus a gap"" solutions exist, most simply . A more formal application of this uniformization of spacing occurs in maximum spacing estimation of parameters.

Expected value of the order statistic for a uniform distribution 
The  approach equals that of plotting the points according to the probability that the last of () randomly drawn values will not exceed the -th smallest of the first  randomly drawn values.

Expected value of the order statistic for a standard normal distribution 
In using a normal probability plot, the quantiles one uses are the rankits, the quantile of the expected value of the order statistic of a standard normal distribution.

More generally, Shapiro–Wilk test uses the expected values of the order statistics of the given distribution; the resulting plot and line yields the generalized least squares estimate for location and scale (from the intercept and slope of the fitted line).
Although this is not too important for the normal distribution (the location and scale are estimated by the mean and standard deviation, respectively), it can be useful for many other distributions.

However, this requires calculating the expected values of the order statistic, which may be difficult if the distribution is not normal.

Median of the order statistics 
Alternatively, one may use estimates of the median of the order statistics, which one can compute based on estimates of the median of the order statistics of a uniform distribution and the quantile function of the distribution; this was suggested by .

This can be easily generated for any distribution for which the quantile function can be computed, but conversely the resulting estimates of location and scale are no longer precisely the least squares estimates, though these only differ significantly for  small.

Heuristics 
Several different formulas have been used or proposed as affine symmetrical plotting positions. Such formulas have the form  for some value of  in the range from 0 to 1, which gives a range between  and .

Expressions include:
 
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .

 .
For large sample size, , there is little difference between these various expressions.

Filliben's estimate 
The order statistic medians are the medians of the order statistics of the distribution. These can be expressed in terms of the quantile function and the order statistic medians for the continuous uniform distribution by:
 
where  are the uniform order statistic medians and  is the quantile function for the desired distribution. The quantile function is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (probability that  is less than or equal to some value). That is, given a probability, we want the corresponding quantile of the cumulative distribution function.

James J. Filliben  uses the following estimates for the uniform order statistic medians:
 
The reason for this estimate is that the order statistic medians do not have a simple form.

Statistical charts and diagrams"
229,249726,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed%20radix,Mixed radix,"Mixed radix numeral systems are non-standard positional numeral systems in which the numerical base varies from position to position. Such numerical representation applies when a quantity is expressed using a sequence of units that are each a multiple of the next smaller one, but not by the same factor. Such units are common for instance in measuring time; a time of 32 weeks, 5 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes, 15 seconds, and 500 milliseconds might be expressed as a number of minutes in mixed-radix notation as:

 ... 32, 5,  7, 45; 15,  500
 ...  ∞, 7, 24, 60; 60, 1000

or as

32∞577244560.15605001000

In the tabular format, the digits are written above their base, and a semicolon indicates the radix point.  In numeral format, each digit has its associated base attached as a subscript, and the radix point is marked by a full stop or period. The base for each digit is the number of corresponding units that make up the next larger unit. As a consequence there is no base (written as ∞) for the first (most significant) digit, since here the ""next larger unit"" does not exist (and note that one could not add a larger unit of ""month"" or ""year"" to the sequence of units, as they are not integer multiples of ""week"").

Examples
The most familiar example of mixed radix systems is in timekeeping and calendars. Western time radices include decimal centuries, decades and years as well as duodecimal months, trigesimal (and untrigesimal and (for February) octovigesimal and enneavigesimal) days, overlapped with duoquinquagesimal weeks and septenary days.  One variant uses tridecimal months, quaternary weeks, and septenary days. Time is further divided by quadrivigesimal hours, sexagesimal minutes and seconds, then decimal fractions thereof.

A standard form for dates is 2021-04-10 16:31:15 which would be a mixed radix number in this definition, but is different because the number of days in a month varies for each month and in leap years.

A mixed radix numeral system can often benefit from a tabular summary.  The system for describing the 604800 seconds of a week starting from midnight on Sunday runs as follows:

In this numeral system, the mixed radix numeral 37172451605760 seconds would be interpreted as 17:51:57 on Wednesday, and 0702402602460 would be 00:02:24 on Sunday.  Ad hoc notations for mixed radix numeral systems are commonplace.

The Maya calendar consists of several overlapping cycles of different radices. A short count tzolk'in overlaps vigesimal named days with tridecimal numbered days. A haab' consists of vigesimal days, octodecimal months, and base-52 years forming a round. In addition, a long count of vigesimal days, octodecimal winal, then vigesimal tun, k'atun, b'ak'tun, etc. tracks historical dates.

A second example of a mixed radix numeral system in current use is in the design and use of currency, where a limited set of denominations are printed or minted with the objective of being able to represent any monetary quantity; the amount of money is then represented by the number of coins or banknotes of each denomination. When deciding which denominations to create (and hence which radices to mix), a compromise is aimed for between a minimal number of different denominations, and a minimal number of individual pieces of coinage required to represent typical quantities.  So, for example, in the UK, banknotes are printed for £50, £20, £10 and £5, and coins are minted for £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p and 1p—these follow the 1-2-5 series of preferred values.

Prior to decimalisation, monetary amounts in the UK were described in terms of pounds, shillings, and pence, with 12 pence per shilling and 20 shillings per pound, so that ""£1 7s 6d"", for example, corresponded to the mixed-radix numeral 1∞720612.

United States customary units are generally mixed-radix systems, with multipliers varying from one size unit to the next in the same manner that units of time do.

Mixed-radix representation is also relevant to mixed-radix versions of the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, in which the indices of the input values are expanded in a mixed-radix representation, the indices of the output values are expanded in a corresponding mixed-radix representation with the order of the bases and digits reversed, and each subtransform can be regarded as a Fourier transform in one digit for all values of the remaining digits.

Manipulation
Mixed-radix numbers of the same base can be manipulated using a generalization of manual arithmetic algorithms.  Conversion of values from one mixed base to another is easily accomplished by first converting the place values of the one system into the other, and then applying the digits from the one system against these.

APL and J include operators to convert to and from mixed-radix systems.

Factorial number system 

Another proposal is the so-called factorial number system:

For example, the biggest number that could be represented with six digits would be 543210 which equals 719 in decimal: 5×5! + 4×4! + 3×3! + 2×2! + 1×1! It might not be clear at first sight but the factorial based numbering system is unambiguous and complete. Every number can be represented in one and only one way because the sum of respective factorials multiplied by the index is always the next factorial minus one:

 

There is a natural mapping between the integers 0, ..., n! − 1 and permutations of n elements in lexicographic order, which uses the factorial representation of the integer, followed by an interpretation as a Lehmer code.

The above equation is a particular case of the following general rule for any radix (either standard or mixed) base representation which expresses the fact that any radix (either standard or mixed) base representation is unambiguous and complete. Every number can be represented in one and only one way because the sum of respective weights multiplied by the index is always the next weight minus one:

 , where ,
which can be easily proved with mathematical induction.

In this operation, 326 houses were burnt, and more than half of the village's residents were killed. Many women were raped by the French soldiers before being killed. Over 300 civilian residents in Mỹ Trạch were assassinated, of whom 170 were women and 157 were children.

The location of the massacre was in the foot of Mỹ Trạch Bridge, a bridge on the North–South Railway, next to Mỹ Trạch Railway Station. The victims were forced to the foot of the bridge and lined up before being killed with machine gun fire.

Every year, November 29 is mourned as ""Hatred Date"" by the residents in this village.

History 

The Bellevue/William O. Lockridge Neighborhood Library was built in 1959 as the Washington Highlands Branch Library, funded under a public works program for the District of Columbia. The building was renamed by the DC Council after it was rebuilt on the original site in 2012.

Designed by David Adjaye, the new Bellevue/William O. Lockridge Neighborhood Library was described in Architectural Record as ""more like a Brutalist treehouse than the glimmering pavilion that is the Francis A. Gregory Neighborhood Library."" The library is set on a steep, hilly site, named both for a community activist and the Bellevue neighborhood.

237,2136546,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymney%20River,Rhymney River,"The Rhymney River () is a river in the Rhymney Valley, South Wales, flowing through Cardiff into the Severn Estuary. The river formed the boundary between the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire until in 1887, the parishes east of the river, Rumney and St Mellons, were transferred from the jurisdiction of Newport, to Cardiff in Glamorgan.

The river flows south from its source near Rhymney through New Tredegar, Bargoed, Ystrad Mynach, Llanbradach to  Caerphilly at the southern end of the Rhymney Valley. Then past Bedwas, Trethomas, Machen, Draethen, Llanrumney and Rumney and its estuary into the River Severn.

The Rhymney Valley () was created as a glacial valley. Sourced within the valley, on the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons, the Rhymney River descends steeply through the town of New Tredegar towards Ystrad Mynach, and then onwards south across a flat plain before entering the Severn Estuary to the east of Cardiff. The villages of Groesfaen, Deri, Pentwyn and Fochriw are located in the Darran Valley and not the Rhymney Valley, which joins the Rhymney Valley at Bargoed.

Covering a distance of , the catchment is divided into two distinct parts:
 The upper reaches: steep-sided, wet, mountainous upper valley
 The lower reaches: flatter wider valley below Machen, where the river assumes a lowland meandering character

Being located in part of the South Wales coalfield and South Wales Valleys iron producing area, the resultant black river had poor water quality through most of the 19th and 20th centuries. The river is culverted in many of its upper sections, including a tunnel under the former factory complexes in Rhymney, exiting at Pontlottyn. Since the closure of the last of the coal mines in the late 1980s, the water has become a lot cleaner and is now full of fish and insect life and supports plenty of other wildlife. The river now supports a healthy stock of grayling and natural brown trout, and a lot of work has been undertaken to remove former industrial restrictions on the river to allow the fish to gain access to its upper reaches. The river is in the care of Natural Resources Wales and the South East Wales Rivers Trust.

239,68602159,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard%20Klan%20Riot%20of%201978,Oxnard Klan Riot of 1978,"On the afternoon of July 30, 1978, in Oxnard, California, the Ku Klux Klan attempted to show The Birth of a Nation at the municipal community center as a recruiting and fundraising drive. The event was disrupted by a combative protest led by the Progressive Labor Party and Committee Against Racism. The demonstrators outnumbered the Klan and Oxnard Police and Ventura County Sheriffs, who protected the event from the demonstrators. A fight and subsequent hours-long protest ensued between the Klan and Police who faced the demonstrators. After some hours, the police broke up the demonstration.

Background 
Oxnard was, until around the 1970s, a majority-white suburb, with the demographics shifting towards becoming a majority-Latino city. The Klan had a historically weak presence in Ventura County, being stronger in the Los Angeles area, particularly in Inglewood and Anaheim.  While for much of its history the city was majority white, by 1963, Oxnard schools were becoming ""majority-minority."" In the 1970s, segregation became a divisive issue in the city, particularly in the context of schools. After the 1971 Soria v. Oxnard School District Board of Trustees verdict challenged the de facto segregation, with the verdict declaring the Oxnard Elementary School District had a responsibility to have ""a racially balanced elementary school system."" A fight over busing students and school district segregation came to a head, but this did not lead to the Klan's rise in Oxnard as it did in towns like Pontiac, Michigan, at around the same time.  Regardless, racial tensions rose, like they did in many LA area suburbs during integration.

Recent history in the county demonstrated that members of the predominantly working-class communities in Ventura County were willing to use militancy. In the decades prior to the event, working-class Mexican immigrants and Chicanos across Ventura County also participated in strikes, riots, and rebellions. The major instances were in La Colonia in 1971, as well as again in 1974, and in nearby Santa Paula twice in the same year. People fought against police departments for the heavy-handed patrolling of neighborhoods, police brutality, and curfews enforced in neighborhoods like La Colonia, which were enforced in full riot police formations. Also in the county, a circuit of activists formed around organizations like the Community Service Organization (CSO), UFW, both known for their leadership by Cesar Chavez in Oxnard, the NAACP, and the Brown Berets, and several unions.  Additionally, a base of activists formed around campuses in the county, particularly with organizations like MEChA and Black Student Union.  

In 1977, Racial tensions would escalate to their highest before the riot due to a rape and murder case, in which three Latino residents of Oxnard murdered Paul Yenney Jr. and raped and assaulted Linda Fiene, both a high-school couple. In July of 1978, the Klan organizers successfully applied for a permit for an event that would be led by Tom Metzger, the Klan's second most famous leader at the time. The Klansmen chose to show The Birth of a Nation, the seminal Klan propaganda piece that outlines much of their central ideology, and was additionally used to stage recruiting rallies as far back as the 1920s. The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), along with their sub-organization Committee Against Racism (CAR), were allowed to protest the event by the City government, as part of the organization's campaign against fascists and racist organizations.

Skirmish and Protests 
In the early afternoon, a crowd of hundreds of PLP/CAR counter-protesters gathered outside of the community center where the Klan would be screening Birth of A Nation. According to police on the ground, the crowd of counter-protesters was described as ""mostly Mexican-Americans"" as well as there being a more moderate NAACP-led crowd.

At approximately 1:30 in the afternoon, the Klansmen charged into the community center. It was at this point where they were met by PLP and CAR demonstrators. The demonstrators used various weapons such as ""dirt-clods, sticks, unopened soda-pop cans, and steel pipes wrapped in newspaper"". Demonstrators and the Klansmen were ""forcibly separated"" by the Oxnard policemen by the doors and at the windows outside of the community center, much of which had sustained surface damage (broken windows). While the police were not fully collaborating the Klan, their initial mission of peacekeeping meant protecting the Klan's event. At this time, the demonstrators combatted the police using the aforementioned mentioned tactics, and police on the scene were ""outnumbered 150-200 to 9"". Many of the demonstrators, while in combat, were chanting ""Death to the klan, kill the klan, kill the klan and the klan cops; we have done it before and we'll do it again"".

After the scene of combat, the more militant demonstrators returned to the original protest and a ""seemingly peaceful"" protest continued until about 3:15. Around this time, an effigy of a Klansman was burned at the demonstration, and by 3:42, the Oxnard Police declared the protest as an unlawful assembly. Police ordered the protesters to disperse six times (in English and Spanish) but to no avail. Protestors jeered at the Police in response, to the cheering enthusiasm of the residents, many of whom congregated on 9th St.    

At 4:00, fifty Oxnard Police and the Ventura County Sheriffs broke up the demonstration and several of the demonstrators were arrested.

Aftermath 

At the initial reporting of the event, an estimated fifteen people suffered serious injuries, and thirteen people were arrested. One of the activists served a short sentence after being charged on the basis of inciting a riot, and participation in unlawful assembly. 

The events in Oxnard did not lead to mass sympathy for the Klan in Oxnard. No ""Klavern"" (town or city Klan chapter) was ever formed in the city. What occurred in Oxnard was one of several incidences of violence that occurred in California and throughout the country in the late 1970s, and preluded intensified violence and the increasing association of the Klan movement with openly Nazi elements. In Castro Valley just two months later, the Klan battled with the PLP and CAR at an event, also lead by Metzger, against Vietnamese refugees who had settled in the town. By 1979, the Klan ramped up their violence at the Greensboro Massacre, wherein the Klan murdered five members of the Communist Workers Party, and again in 1980 in Oceanside California, when Klansmen brutally assaulted counter-demonstrators.

241,4906148,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libera%20Universit%C3%A0%20Maria%20SS.%20Assunta,Libera Università Maria SS. Assunta,"The Libera Università Maria SS. Assunta, often simply abbreviated as ""LUMSA"", is a private Roman Catholic university founded in 1939 in Rome. It is the second oldest university in Rome after Sapienza.

LUMSA was privately founded but belongs to the national Italian network of universities and is therefore able to confer recognised degrees and diploma titles which have full legal force. The principal aspects of LUMSA are to be found in its humanist vocation and Catholic orientation. It has a humanist vocation because in a society which is scientifically and technologically advanced there is a growing awareness of the need for ‘wise knowledge’ which is rooted in an authentic idea of man and is able to promote progress for the real good of man and the human community. LUMSA belongs to the national and international scientific research network and has research programmes which operate within certain specific areas: education, the social services, the philosophical, philological and literary sciences, mass communications, juridical sciences, economics, computer science and data science.

Organization
The university began its life as the ""Istituto Superiore di Magistero Maria Ss. Assunta"", an educational institute for nuns founded in 1939 by Luigia Tincani (Royal Decree no. 1760 of 26 October 1939). In 1989 it was reconstituted as ""Libera Università Maria SS. Assunta"" (LUMSA), a university for women. The university was opened to men in 1991.

LUMSA is a private Catholic institution with autonomy at all levels of the university. As an Italian accredited institution, its degrees are considered equivalent to those issued by Italian public universities.

The university is governed by a Council which includes a President, a Rector, two Pro-Rectors, a Director General, and general council members. Since 2017, the President has been Cardinal Giovanni Lajolo.

University teaching is distributed across three departments:
 Department of Law, Economics, Politics and Modern languages (Rome)
 Department of Law (Palermo)
 Department of Human Studies, Communication, Education, and Psychology (Rome).

Research
Research and study activities, which are the vital lymph source of every university system, are always characterised in LUMSA by involvement in cultural and scientific dialogue about the great subjects of contemporary debate. Over the years the research activities of the faculties of the university have given rise to a great deal of individual and group research which has been flanked over time by inter-university and international research financed by public and private agencies, by structures providing such services, and by funds provided by the university itself. At the present time research activity is organised around the various research centres of the three faculties.

Teaching
LUMSA University is characterised by the duality of tradition and modernity because it integrates humanistic and classical knowledge with economics, information technology and management. Another characteristic of this university is the emphasis it places on students deserving of financial help. Indeed, the overall level of the fees for the first income band has been made almost the same as that in state universities.

The educational structure of LUMSA is arranged around four divisions. The university offers, through the divisions, undergraduate degrees (Italian laurea) in various social science fields and in data science. In post-graduate education, LUMSA offers several graduate programs and two long-cycle programs in law and education sciences, as well as four PhDs (Italian dottorato di ricerca).

242,4166330,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayt%20al-mal,Bayt al-mal,"Bayt al-mal () is an Arabic term that is translated as ""House of money"" or ""House of Wealth."" Historically, it was a financial institution responsible for the administration of taxes in Islamic states, particularly in the early Islamic Caliphate. It served as a royal treasury for the caliphs and sultans, managing personal finances and government expenditures. Further, it administered distributions of zakat revenues for public works. Modern Islamic economists deem the institutional framework appropriate for contemporary Islamic societies.

History
Bayt al-mal was the department that dealt with the revenues and all other economical matters of the state. In the time of Muhammad, there was no permanent Bait-ul-Mal or public treasury. Whatever revenues or other amounts were received were distributed immediately. During Prophethood, the last receipt was tribute from Bahrain amounting 800000 dirham which was distributed in just one sitting. There were no salaries to be paid, and there was no state expenditure. Hence the need for the treasury at public level was not felt. In the time of Abu Bakr as well there was no treasury. Abu Bakr earmarked a house where all money was kept on receipt. As all money was distributed immediately the treasury generally remained locked up. At the time of the death of Abu Bakr, there was only one dirham in the public treasury.

According to Rahman, the word 'bayt mal al-muslimin' (or 'bayt mal-Allah''') referred originally to the building in early Muslim history where war spoils and other public properties of the caliphate were stored and re-distributed to the community, but over time the term evolved to refer to the societal institution owning such public properties of the Muslims, and hence encompasses the authority in control of the state's public revenue and expenditures.

Establishment of Bait-ul-Maal

In the time of Umar, things changed. With the extension in conquests money came in larger quantities, Umar also allowed salaries to men fighting in the army.  Abu Huraira, who was the Governor of Bahrain, sent a revenue of five hundred thousand dirhams. Umar summoned a meeting of his Consultative Assembly and sought the opinion of the Companions about the disposal of the money. Uthman ibn Affan advised that the amount should be kept for future needs. Walid bin Hisham suggested that like the Byzantines, separate departments of Treasury and Accounts should be set up.

After consulting the Companions, Umar decided to establish the Central Treasury at Madinah. Abdullah bin Arqam was appointed as the Treasury Officer. He was assisted by Abdur Rahman bin Awf and Muiqib. A separate Accounts Department was also set up and it was required to maintain record of all that was spent. Later, provincial treasuries were set up in the provinces. After meeting the local expenditure, the provincial treasuries were required to remit the surplus amount to the central treasury at Madinah. According to Yaqubi, the salaries and stipends charged to the central treasury amounted to over 30 million dirhams.

A separate building was constructed for the royal treasury by the name bait ul maal, which in large cities was guarded by as many as 400 guards. In most of the historical accounts, it states that among the Rashidun caliphs, Uthman ibn Affan was first to struck the coins, some accounts however states that Umar was first to do so. When Persia was conquered, three types of coins were current in the conquered territories, namely Baghli of 8 dang; Tabari of 4 dang; and Maghribi of 3 dang. Umar ( according to some accounts Uthman ) made an innovation and struck an Islamic dirham of 6 dang.

Charity
The concepts of welfare and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of Zakat (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, under the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century. This practice continued well into the Abbasid era of the Caliphate. The taxes (including Zakat and Jizya) collected in the treasury of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to stockpile food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred. Thus, according to Shadi Hamid, the Caliphate can be considered the world's first major ""welfare state"". (see online )

During the Rashidun Caliphate, various welfare programs were introduced by Caliph Umar. Umar himself lived ""a simple life and detached himself from any of the worldly luxuries,"" like how he often wore ""worn-out shoes and was usually clad in patched-up garments,"" or how he would sleep ""on the bare floor of the mosque."" Limitations on wealth were also set for governors and officials, who would often be ""dismissed if they showed any outward signs of pride or wealth which might distinguish them from the people."" This was an early attempt at erasing ""class distinctions which might inevitably lead to conflict."" Umar also made sure that the public treasury was not wasted on ""unnecessary luxuries"" as he believed that ""the money would be better spent if it went towards the welfare of the people rather than towards lifeless bricks.""

Umar's innovative welfare reforms during the Rashidun Caliphate included the introduction of social security. In the Rashidun Caliphate, whenever citizens were injured or lost their ability to work, it became the state's responsibility to make sure that their minimum needs were met, with the unemployed and their families receiving an allowance from the public treasury. Retirement pensions were provided to elderly people, who had retired and could ""count on receiving a stipend from the public treasury."" Babies who were abandoned were also taken care of, with one hundred dirhams spent annually on each orphan’s development. Umar also introduced the concept of public trusteeship and public ownership when he implemented the Waqf, or charitable trust, system, which transferred ""wealth from the individual or the few to a social collective ownership,"" in order to provide ""services to the community at large."" For example, Umar brought land from the Banu Harithah and converted it into a charitable trust, which meant that ""profit and produce from the land went towards benefiting the poor, slaves, and travelers.""

During the great famine of 18 AH (638 CE), Umar introduced further reforms, such as the introduction of food rationing using coupons, which were given to those in need and could be exchanged for wheat and flour. Another innovative concept that was introduced was that of a poverty threshold, with efforts made to ensure a minimum standard of living, making sure that no citizen across the empire would suffer from hunger. In order to determine the poverty line, Umar ordered an experiment to test how many seers of flour would be required to feed a person for a month. He found that 25 seers of flour could feed 30 people, and so he concluded that 50 seers of flour would be sufficient to feed a person for a month. As a result, he ordered that the poor each receive a food ration of fifty seers of flour per month. In addition, the poor and disabled were guaranteed cash stipends. However, in order to avoid some citizens taking advantage of government services, ""begging and laziness were not tolerated"" and ""those who received government benefits were expected to be contributing members in the community.""

Further reforms later took place under the Umayyad Caliphate. Registered soldiers who were disabled in service received an invalidity pension, while similar provisions were made for the disabled and poor in general. Caliph Al-Walid I assigned payments and services to the needy, which included money for the poor, guides for the blind, and servants for the crippled, and pensions for all disabled people so that they would never need to beg. The caliphs Al-Walid II and Umar ibn Abdul-Aziz supplied money and clothes to the blind and crippled, as well as servants for the latter. This continued with the Abbasid caliph Al-Mahdi. Tahir ibn Husayn, governor of the Khurasan province of the Abbasid Caliphate, states in a letter to his son that pensions from the treasury should be provided to the blind, to look after the poor and destitute in general, to make sure not to overlook victims of oppression who are unable to complain and are ignorant of how to claim their rights, and that pensions should be assigned to victims of calamities and the widows and orphans they leave behind. The ""ideal city"" described by the Islamic philosophers, Al-Farabi and Avicenna, also assigns funds to the disabled.

When communities were stricken by famine, rulers would often support them though measures such as the remission of taxes, importation of food, and charitable payments, ensuring that everyone had enough to eat. However, private charity through the Waqf trust institution often played a greater role in the alleviation of famines than government measures did. From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the Waqf'' (charitable trusts) for the purpose of building and supporting public institutions, often Madrassah educational institutions and Bimaristan hospitals.

243,66872138,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia%20for%20Equality,Academia for Equality,"Academia for Equality (A4E; ) is a members' organization working to promote democratization, equality and access to higher education for all communities living in Israel. The organization numbers more than 600 Israeli members, from universities and colleges both in Israel and abroad, including students, researchers, and lecturers. The members of the organization struggle against the complicity of Israeli academia in the occupied Palestinian territories, and actively combat abusive labour relations, sexual harassment, and the silencing of critical voices in Israel and around the world. Prominent members include Joel Beinin, Uri Davis, Neve Gordon, Alon Harel, Rela Mazali, Vered Slonim-Nevo, and Oren Yiftachel.

Establishment and goals 
Academy for Equality is a members’ organization established in 2015, which numbers more than 600 members from different higher education institutions. Academy for Equality is an extra-institutional organization, which accommodates academics of all levels, who are committed to promoting structural changes for achieving an academy free of violence and discrimination. The organization operated democratically, and holds public discussion on different issues, according to the principles of transparency and wide consent. The organizations board is elected in an annual meeting, in which every member can participate. Academia for Equality is a grassroots movement that is organized through small teams or projects lead by members, which are supported by the elected board. Each team is responsible for organizing its own members in Israel and abroad, and for communicating its actions and plans to the board and to the broader membership.

Teams and projects 
Academy for Equality has several teams who are regularly working to promote the organizations vision and goals.

First-generations in higher education 
The team advances awareness to ""first-generation"" as an intersectional policy tool in an effort to tackle institutional blindness to the issue, and address the enormous challenges of diversity work in the context of Israeli academia. Academia for Equality attempts to deal with these multiple forms and challenges of inequality, exclusion and discrimination in higher education through raising awareness, setting the agenda, and supporting and participating in a special workshop designed to provide a space of learning and support for first-generation graduate students in Israeli academia. These workshops are held both in Hebrew and in Arabic, and have taken place in Tel Aviv University, Ben Gurion University in the Negev, and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Fighting sexual harassment 
The team advances a political discourse, that encourages taking responsibility for the widespread complicity in its perpetuation. The team supports and accompanies victims of sexual harassment throughout the various stages of their struggle; organizes public events, gathers information from a broad range of institutions and sources, makes it accessible, and advocates for better institutional policies for handling reports and complaints.

Labor struggles 
The team supports labor struggles in Israeli academia; develops critical knowledge on the conditions of precarity and exploitation in the Israeli context, as well as works towards the establishment of broad cooperation and better coordination between various de-centralized struggles and among various labor unions representing the most vulnerable sections of the academic and the administrative staff, including the cleaners and the adjunct staff.

Neoliberalism 
The team makes critical knowledge on academia available, accessible and relevant to the general public and to Israeli academic institutions. The team promotes a struggle against the neoliberal culture of academia, and opposed the use of arbitrary quantitative matrices during the hiring process. Academy for equality holds public events, where critical knowledge on academia is shared and disseminated, and connects with critical movements in the global academy such as rethink the university, the open-source movement, and the decolonizing the university movement.

Solidarity with Palestinian Academia 
The team works to develop in a responsible and ethical way ties and solidarity relations with individual Palestinian academics and academic institutions. Academia for Equality advance solidarity work among other things by turning the spotlight on Israeli academy complicity and collusion with the occupation, militarization, and the repression of Palestinian academia. The organization protests violations of academic freedoms, as well as of Palestinian basic rights and freedoms.

The team has previously been involved in several activities, including the joint international campaign launched in 2016 by University of Kadoorie and Academia for Equality demanding the removal of military forces from campus territories, monitoring the imprisonment of Palestinian academics and students from the west bank and supporting their release, cooperation with the international organization “Scientists for Palestine” and Palestinian academics in the struggle against academic freedom violations committed by Israel, the establishment of the “complicit academy” database that documents the involvement of Israeli academia in the occupation, and the struggle against the cooperation between the IDF and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem through the intelligence unit “Havatzalot” as well as other activities at the Mount Scopus campus directed and the adjacent neighborhood Isawiya. This activity has gained the support of the European Anthropological society, as well as the human rights committee of the Middle East Studies Association (MESA). The organization has also worked to stop the cooperation between the medicine faculty of Tel Aviv University and Ariel University, which the organization defines as an “apartheid institution”

Global Solidarity work 
The team works to establish ties with and support individuals and institutions whose academic freedoms are threatened. The organization supports academics who are subject to various pressures through campaigns of intimidation and harassment, including academics who are accused of being antisemitic for criticizing Israel, as well as other types of social and political persecution. The organization has sounded protest in cases where academic freedom was violated due to political reasons, including in the case of Lara Al Qasem, the cancellation of a lecture at the Free University of Berlin by the Palestinian research Lila Sharif due to political pressure, and ending the search for candidates for a professorship named after Edward Said at Fresno University in California because all the candidates were of Arab origin. The organization was one of the first to demand an inquiry into the circumstances that forced Dr Dotan Leshem, a member of the organization, to leave the Haifa University due to his public speech and public activity. In January 2018 the organization dispatched a delegation to Turkey to support the academics who were persecuted there by the regime for signing a peace petition.

Career

Karting
Born in Dundee, Williamson began karting at the age of eight, and spent a successful decade racing in the various classes around the United Kingdom. By the time Williamson moved into the junior formulae in 2008, he had claimed three Scottish karting championship titles at Cadet and MiniMax levels, before taking a clean sweep in 2008. The first driver to record such a feat, Williamson won the British Open, British Grand Prix Super Kart, the Scottish Open, as well as the 125 ICC Championship.

Formula Renault
After a guest drive in Formula Jedi at Brands Hatch in which he won one of the two races, Williamson moved up into Formula Renault, contesting the 2008 Formula Renault UK Winter Series after Highland Arena Ltd, an organisation set up by three family friends helping to promote sporting talent from the Scottish Highlands – where Williamson resides – leased a car from CR Scuderia. In his second race in the category at Croft, Williamson finished on the podium, taking a third-place finish behind James Calado and Henry Surtees. He added another third place in the final race at Rockingham Motor Speedway, finishing behind Surtees and Dean Stoneman, to end up in sixth place in the championship standings, a point behind fifth-placed William Buller. He also contested the Estoril round of the Portuguese Formula Renault 2.0 Winter Series, taking second and fifth-place finishes for CR Scuderia.

CR Scuderia, under their new name of CRS Racing, signed Williamson for the 2009 season as part of a four-car team alongside Harry Tincknell, Matias Laine and Joshua Scott. Williamson's Winter Series campaign ruled him ineligible for the Graduates Cup for drivers aged nineteen or under. During the season, Williamson finished 17 of the 20 races, taking a third place at Donington Park and a second place at Brands Hatch en route to a tenth place championship finish.

Williamson moved to defending champions Manor Competition for the 2010 season, again as part of a four-car team with Will Stevens, Thomas Hylkema and Josh Mulholland, with Ollie Millroy replacing Mulholland during the season. In the first round of the season at Thruxton, Williamson claimed the first pole position, and thus became the first driver to take pole in the Barazi-Epsilon-designed car introduced for the 2010 season. Several races later at Brands Hatch, Williamson threw away a chance at his first victory, spinning out of the lead and eventually finishing seventh. The first victory came a month later at Oulton Park, overtaking Tom Blomqvist at the start of the first race and was never headed.

Williamson took further wins at Croft and Silverstone – a rescheduled race from Brands Hatch which Williamson had qualified on pole for – as he and Blomqvist commenced their battle for the championship along with Tamás Pál Kiss and Will Stevens. Williamson trailed Pál Kiss by 27 points and Blomqvist by 15 before the World Series by Renault meeting at Silverstone. Williamson won both races from pole position, to trail Blomqvist by one point on dropped scores heading into the final round at Brands Hatch. In the first race, Williamson finished second, ahead of Blomqvist in third, but Blomqvist claimed fastest lap to draw level with Williamson before the final race. In the final race, Blomqvist made a better start and with team-mate Alex Lynn acting as rear gunner, Blomqvist won the championship with his second place. Despite this, Williamson was nominated for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award due to his performances in the series. On 5 December 2010, after the evaluation tests held at Silverstone, Williamson was named as the winner of the award, taking the £100,000 cash prize and a Formula One test with McLaren.

GP3 Series
After the end of his Formula Renault campaign, Williamson took part in the post-season GP3 Series test in Estoril, Portugal. Driving for Atech CRS GP, Williamson set the fastest time in the afternoon session on the second and third days, having arrived at the circuit the day before after a chance conversation with team boss David Hayle. Williamson was eventually signed by MW Arden to graduate into GP3 in February 2011.

Formula Renault 3.5 Series
After testing for ISR Racing during the final test session of 2010, Williamson took part in the opening round of the 2011 season for the team at Motorland Aragón, deputising for regular driver Daniel Ricciardo who was on third driver duties for Scuderia Toro Rosso at the .

Typically organised in July or August, the event was first held in 1919 (the first summer after the country's formation) until 1992. The competition was not held in the years from 1938 to 1944 due to World War II and ran for 66 editions in total. It was superseded by the Czech Athletics Championships and Slovak Athletics Championships following the country's dissolution in 1993. Czechoslovakia had sometimes hosted separate Czech and Slovak sub-national championships before then.

The Czechoslovak Indoor Athletics Championships was later introduced in 1969 to complement the summer outdoor event with a spring one.

Events
By its final year, the competition programme featured a total of 35 individual Czechoslovak Championship athletics events, 19 for men and 16 for women. For men, there were seven track running events, three obstacle events, four jumps, four throws, and the decathlon. Women did not have pole vault, hammer throw or 3000 metres steeplechase championship contests.

Track running
100 metres, 200 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, 1500 metres, 3000 metres (women only), 5000 metres (men only), 10,000 metres
Obstacle events
100 metres hurdles (women only), 110 metres hurdles (men only), 400 metres hurdles, 3000 metres steeplechase (men only)
Jumping events
Pole vault (men only), high jump, long jump, triple jump
Throwing events
Shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, hammer throw (men only)
Combined events
Decathlon (men only), heptathlon (women only)

Men competed in a 200 metres hurdles until 1967, by which point the event had fallen out of favour in international competitions. The women's programme was gradually expanded from the 1960s onwards, with the 1500 m appearing in 1969, the 3000 m in 1972, the 10,000 m in 1984, and the triple jump in 1990. The women's hurdles events gradually changed too: the 80 metres hurdles became the 100 m version in 1968, a 200 m version was held from 1970 to 1972, then the women's 400 m hurdles began in 1975. The women's combined event was the athletics pentathlon up to 1980.

Separate championship events were held for road running and walks, and cross country running.

Arts and culture

Mahanay Memorial Bell Tower 
Completed in October 1966 at nearly 14 stories or  in height, the  Mahanay Memorial Bell Tower is named for Floyd Mahanay who left an endowment of $350,000 to have the tower built. However, the funds were not sufficient to provide for a full carillon of bells on top. In 2016, upon the 50th anniversary of the tower being built, $440,905 funds were acquired to add a four-octave, 47-bell carillon at the top of the tower. The bells are expected to be chiming the summer of 2017 and will be operated by a digital piano to give tunes for weddings, birthdays, funerals and even the local high school's fight song after games. For many years, the tower provides the current time with a recording of the Westminister Chimes. An elevator in the tower takes visitors to the observation deck for stunning views of cornfields in 5 Iowa counties. As of 2016, there are more than seventeen other buildings in Iowa taller than the Mahanay Tower: 12 in Des Moines, 3 in Cedar Rapids, and 2 in Davenport.

Multi-field dictionaries should be contrasted with single-field dictionaries and sub-field dictionaries.

The typology consisting of these three dictionaries is important for a number of reasons. First of all, a multi-field dictionary is an example of the ordinary technical dictionary, covering numerous subject fields, e.g. banking, economics, finance, insurance and marketing. 

The main problem with multi-field dictionaries is that they tend to cover one or two subjects extensively, whereas the vast majority of subject are only represented by a limited number of terms.

Secondly, the typical multi-field dictionary tends to be a minimizing dictionary, i.e. it covers only a limited number of terms within the subjects covered.

Thirdly, if the lexicographers intend to make a bilingual, maximizing multi-field dictionary they run into problems with the large amount of data that has to be included in the dictionary.

Consequently, the best coverage of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the subject field covered by a dictionary will be found in a single-field dictionary.

Shortly after the release of Lemon Demon's 2008 album View-Monster, Cicierega began work on a follow-up which would be released eight years later as Spirit Phone. 

In July 2009, ""Eighth Wonder"", a song about the cryptid Gef was made available as an mp3 download on lemondemon.com, followed by a music video for the song posted to his Youtube channel in November of that year. This release was nearly identical to the version heard on Spirit Phone. A demo produced during this time titled ""Ivanushka"" would later be adapted into Spirit Phone track ""Touch Tone Telephone"". The original version was eventually released to Neil Cicierega's Patreon in January 2018.

Between 2010 and 2016, Cicierega would tease more early versions of tracks that would eventually appear on Spirit Phone, released online as demos or performed live. In April 2012, an early version of ""Reaganomics"" was uploaded to Neil's second channel, along with a video accompaniment intended for live shows, edited from clips of Ronald Reagan in his final film role The Killers. Reaganomics would be performed live at the anime convention Youmacon 2012, along with early versions of ""As Your Father I Expressly Forbid It"", ""Ancient Aliens"", and ""Cabinet Man"".

In July 2012, Cicierega posted two unused opening themes for the animated television series Gravity Falls to his Tumblr blog, elements of which would become Spirit Phone bonus tracks ""Gravitron"", and ""Moon's Request"" respectively (the latter being a remix of the original opening theme Cicierega made for Gravity Falls that removes any mentions of the show). In October 2014, ""When He Died"" was released on Patreon.

The album was released digitally on February 29, 2016, followed by a physical release on vinyl, CD and cassette in October 2018 by Needlejuice Records.

Reception 
Spirit Phone received generally positive reception, holding a score of 4/5 on AllMusic.

Mashable included ""Touch-Tone Telephone"" and ""Eighth Wonder"" on their official 2019 Halloween playlist, calling ""Touch-Tone Telephone"" one of many ""real gems"". Cultured Vultures called the horror-themed Spirit Phone ""one of the wildest pop albums of the year"". The album was the best-selling album on Bandcamp for the first week of its release.

Cabinet Man, a song about a man who turns himself into a half-human arcade machine would later inspire the indie game Neon Nemesis, featured at the 2019 Alt.Ctrl.GDC Exhibition. The game is played by up to four racers, against a fifth player, the ""nemesis"" who controls their character out of sight of the others, from inside the game cabinet itself.

Track listing 
All tracks are written, performed and recorded by Neil Cicierega, except where noted.

Bonus tracks 
The album also contains 13 bonus tracks; consisting of demos, cut songs, and additional music. The following is the track listing of the deluxe bonus CD. On digital services these tracks are arranged in alphabetical order and all subtitled ""(Bonus Track)""; and ""Sweet Bod (Demo)"" is simply named ""Sweet Bod"".

The vinyl and cassette releases contain the bonus tracks ""Crisis Actors"", ""Redesign Your Logo"", ""Pizza Heroes"", ""You're at the Party"" and ""Angry People"". The bonus track ""Kubrick and the Beast"" was added to the vinyl and cassette releases starting with 2022 pressings. All physical releases also include a download card for the full album, along with album commentary by Cicierega, except for the CD release which already has the full album and commentary.

257,11190269,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajka,Rajka,"Rajka (, ,  ) is a village in Győr-Moson-Sopron County, Hungary. The village has large Slovak and  German minorities.

Etymology
The name comes from the Slavic personal name Rajko, Rajka (derived from rajь: paradise). 1297 Royka.

Geography
Rajka is located in the Little Hungarian Plain  north-west of Mosonmagyaróvár, near the point where the borders of Hungary, Austria, and Slovakia join. M15 motorway (E65/E75), Highway 150, and the Budapest–Hegyeshalom–Rajka railway line all cross the village. The Hungarian-Slovak border crossing between Rajka and Čunovo was lifted on 21 December 2007, when Hungary and Slovakia acceded to the Schengen Area.

History
Rajka was established before the 13th century. According to the Hungarian Royal Treasury (Magyar Királyi Kincstár) it was an ethnic German settlement in Hungary, called Rackendorf in 1495. In the 18th century it was a market town (mezőváros) in Moson County. The Jewish community was forcibly deported in 1944. After the Soviet occupation of Hungary in 1946, 859 German civilians were expelled from Rajka. They were replaced by ethnic Hungarians expelled from Czechoslovakia.

Population
Mayor Vince Kiss spoke in 2012 of 1,000 Slovak citizens living in Rajka and making up one-third of the population. Most of these are ethnic Slovaks, but a significant proportion are ethnic Hungarian citizens of Slovakia or conversant with the Hungarian language. These Slovak citizens form a fragmented, dormitory community of people working or studying in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, and commuting there every day.

According to the 2011 census, however, the population of Rajka was 2,758, of whom 1,938 (70.3%) declared themselves Hungarians, 535 (19.4%) Slovaks and 284 (10.3%) Germans by ethnicity.

It offered the IB Primary Years Programme and IB Diploma Programme. The school's other major programs included International General Certificate of Secondary Education for ninth and tenth-graders. As of April 2012, the school is no longer open due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War.

The ISA was a co-educational day school sponsored by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA). ISA offered a high quality, internationally acceptable program, primarily for the children of ICARDA employees. At the time of its closure, there were 385 students enrolled in grades K-12 representing 37 countries.

This school had a high range of facilities and a very strong athletic department. The campus had 14 buses, various administrative buildings and many green parks. The school had one soccer field, a tennis and badminton court, a volleyball court and a basketball court.

The elementary school had a swimming program as well as many other after-school extra-curriculars. The secondary school also offered various extra-curricular and other opportunities outside of school. For instance, students in Grade 6-12 participated in ""Regional Studies Trips"" where they traveled to other regions in Syria and around the Middle East to learn about new cultures.

He was born in LaRue, Texas, and attended Southwestern University. He hit and threw right-handed.

Career
Reynolds was a consistent hitter who batted .300 six times. He played all three outfield positions, but was suited to right field, especially since he had a good throwing arm.

Reynolds enjoyed his best season in 1930, with career highs in batting average (.359), home runs (22), RBI (104), runs (103), hits (202), triples (18) and games played (138). On July 2, he hit three home runs in consecutive at bats.

In the first game of a Senators-Yankees doubleheader on July 4, 1932, Reynolds sustained a broken jaw when he was punched by Bill Dickey after a collision at home plate. Dickey was suspended for 30 days and fined $1000 and Reynolds did not play again until August 13.

In his 13-year career, Reynolds was a .302 hitter with 80 home runs and 699 RBI over 1,222 games. Defensively, he posted a .970 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions.

Reynolds died in 1978 in Houston, TX at the age of 75.

264,55781608,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundo%20Lingo,Mundo Lingo,"Mundo Lingo are free language social events that happen independently in various metropolises in different countries. They usually take place in the late evening during the week (7pm to midnight) in a specific bar. They gather many men and women of all ages and all nationalities that wish to learn or improve one or more languages.

Principle

Each participant receives flags to stick to their clothes. They are supposed to indicate their native language at the top, and the rest below (generally the languages they master and below the one they want to learn). Then, people are free to chat with each other while having drinks.

History

The first Mundo Lingo event was an initiative of UK born Benji Moreira when he was an immigrant in Buenos Aires (Argentina). It took place on July 7, 2011 and was aimed for local Argentines to learn foreign languages and for internationals to practice Spanish.
After a while, around 50 people per week were attending and the flag system was introduced. In 2014 the event grew increasingly popular and was exported to Cologne, London, Montreal, and then Melbourne.

Cities

As of September 2018, Mundo Lingo events regularly take place in up to 30 cities, 24 countries and 5 continents.

Asia
As of September 2018, Mundo Lingo events regularly take place in Saigon and Hanoi (Vietnam), Bangkok and Chiang Mai (Thailand), Nanjing (China), Osaka (Japan), Singapore and Yangon (Myanmar) .

Oceania
As of September 2018, Mundo Lingo events regularly take place in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane (Australia) and Wellington and Auckland (New Zealand).

Europe
As of September 2018, Mundo Lingo events regularly take place in Barcelona (Spain), Cologne, Stuttgart and Munich (Germany), Copenhagen (Denmark), Geneva (Switzerland), London (England), Paris (France) and Oslo (Norway).

America
As of September 2018, Mundo Lingo events regularly take place in Buenos Aires, Córdoba and La Plata (Argentina), Lima (Peru), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Montréal and Toronto (Canada), New York (United States).

Move to social networks after COVID-19

Mundo Lingo always relies on social networking. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which forced the live events to be suspended until further notice, the subscribers to Facebook and Telegram groups began to increase dramatically instead. As of August 1st, 2020, Facebook groups show a total of more than 135,000 subscribers worldwide  while Telegram groups show more than 12,000 daily users.

266,887427,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinRAR,WinRAR,"WinRAR is a trialware file archiver utility for Windows, developed by Eugene Roshal of win.rar GmbH. It can create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats, and unpack numerous archive file formats. To enable the user to test the integrity of archives, WinRAR embeds CRC32 or BLAKE2 checksums for each file in each archive. WinRAR supports creating encrypted, multi-part and self-extracting archives.

WinRAR is a Windows-only program. An Android application called ""RAR for Android"" is also available. Related programs include the command-line utilities ""RAR"" and ""UNRAR"" and versions for macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, Windows CE, and MS-DOS.

Evolution

WinRAR and the RAR file format have evolved over time. Support for the archive format RAR5, using the same RAR file extension as earlier versions, was added in version 5.0; the older RAR file format has since been referred to as RAR4. WinRAR versions before 5.0 do not support RAR5 archives; only older versions of WinRAR run on Windows versions prior to Windows Vista, and cannot open RAR5 archives.

The RAR5 file format increased the maximum dictionary size to 1 GB; 11 different compression directory sizes from 1 MB to 1 GB are available, with the default in version 5 increased from 4 MB to 32 MB, typically improving compression ratio. AES encryption, when used, is in CBC mode and was increased in strength from 128- to 256-bit. Maximum path length for files in RAR and ZIP archives is increased to 2,048 characters.

Options added in v5.0 include 256-bit BLAKE2 file-hashing algorithm instead of default 32-bit CRC32, duplicate file detection, NTFS hard and symbolic links, and Quick Open record to allow large archives to be opened faster.

The RAR5 file format removed comments for each file (though archive comment still remains), authenticity verification, and specialized compression algorithms for text and multimedia files. RAR5 also changed the file name for split volumes from ""archivename.rNN"" to ""archivename.partNN.rar"".

Features
 Creation of packed RAR or ZIP archives.
 Unpacking of ARJ, BZIP2, CAB, GZ, ISO, JAR, LHA, RAR, TAR, UUE, XZ, Z, ZIP, ZIPX, ZST, 7z, 001 (split) archives, as well as EXE files containing these archive formats
 Checksum (integrity) verification for ARJ, BZIP2, CAB, GZ, BZIP2, RAR, XZ, ZIP and 7z archives
 Multithreaded CPU compression and decompression

When creating RAR archives:
 Support for maximum file size of 16 EiB, about 1.8 × 1019 bytes or 18 million TB
 Compression dictionary from 1 MiB to 1 GiB (it is limited to 256 MiB on 32-bit editions of Windows, although 32-bit Windows still can decompress archives with 1 GiB dictionary; default size is 32 MiB)
 Optional 256-bit BLAKE2 file hash can replace default 32-bit CRC32 file checksum
 Optional encryption using AES with a 256-bit key in CBC mode, using key derivation function based on PBKDF2 using HMAC-SHA256
 Optional data redundancy is provided in the form of Reed–Solomon recovery records and recovery volumes, allowing reconstruction of damaged archives (including reconstruction of entirely missed volumes)
 Optional ""quick open record"" to open RAR files faster
 Ability to create multi-volume (split) archives
 Ability to create self-extracting files (multi-volume self-extracting archives are supported; the self-extractor can execute commands, such as running a specified program before or after self-extraction)
 Support for advanced NTFS file system options, such as NTFS hard and symbolic links
 Support for maximum path length up to 2,048 characters (stored in the UTF-8 format)
 Optional archive comment (stored in the UTF-8 format)
 Optional file time stamp preservation: creation, last access, high precision modification times
 Optional file deduplication

License
The software is distributed as ""try before you buy""; it may be used without charge for 40 days. When the period expires, the non-enterprise functionalities remain available, a move intended to discourage piracy. In China, a free-to-use personal edition has been provided officially since 2015.

Although archiving with the RAR format is proprietary, RARLAB supplies as copyrighted freeware the C++ source code of the current UnRAR unpacker, with a license allowing it to be used in any software, thus enabling others to produce software capable of unpacking, but not creating, RAR archives.

RAR for Android is free of charge. It displays advertisements; for a payment they can be disabled. A license for WinRAR does not provide ad-suppression for RAR for Android.

Security
In February 2019, a major security vulnerability in the unacev2.dll library which is used by WinRAR to decompress ACE archives was discovered. Consequently, WinRAR dropped the support for the ACE format from version 5.70.

Self-extracting archives created with versions before 5.31 (including the executable installer of WinRAR itself) are vulnerable to DLL hijacking: they may load and use DLLs named UXTheme.dll, RichEd32.dll and RichEd20.dll if they are in the same folder as the executable file.

It was widely reported that WinRAR v5.21 and earlier had a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability which could allow a remote attacker to insert malicious code into a self-extracting executable (SFX) file being created by a user, ""putting over 500 million users of the software at risk"". However, examination of the claim revealed that, while the vulnerability existed, the result was merely an SFX which delivered its payload when executed; published responses dismissed the threat, one saying ""If you can find suckers who will trust a .exe labelled as self-extracting archive ... then you can trick them into running your smuggled JavaScript"".

History

Versions
 Command line RAR and UNRAR were first released in autumn 1993.
 Early development version WinRAR 1.54b was released in 1995 as Windows 3.x software.
 3.00 (2002-05): the new RAR3 archive format is implemented. The new archives cannot be managed by older versions of WinRAR. Solid compression and WAV audio lossless compression features are added.
 3.41 (2004-12): adds support for Linux .Z archives like GZIP and BZIP2. New options include storing entire file paths and restoring compressed NTFS files.
 3.50 (2005-08): adds support for interface skins and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.
 3.60 (2006-08): adds multithreaded version of the compression algorithm, which improves compression speed on systems with multiple dual-core or hyper-threading-enabled CPUs.
 3.80 (2008-09): adds support for ZIP archives, which contain Unicode file names in UTF-8.
 3.90 (2009-05): adds support for the x86-64 architecture and Windows 7. Multithreaded support is enhanced.
 3.91 is the last release that supports Valencian.
 3.92 is the last release that supports Serbian Cyrillic and Serbian Latin.
 4.00 (2011-03): decompression is sped up by up to 30%. Windows 98, Windows ME, and Windows NT are no longer supported; the minimum Windows version required is Windows 2000.
 4.10 (2012-01): removes all ZIP limitations now allowing unlimited number of files and archive size. WinRAR now also allows creation of multivolume ZIP files. ZIP archives now include Unicode file names.
 4.20 (2012-06): compression speed in SMP mode is increased significantly, but this improvement was made at the expense of increased memory usage. ZIP compression now uses SMP as well. The default SMP mode cannot handle text; text compression is significantly worse unless additional switches are used. Also, Windows 2000 compatibility was removed.
 5.00 (2013-09): the RAR5 archive format is implemented. RAR5 compressed archives cannot be managed by old versions of WinRAR. The RAR 5 format improves multi-core processor utilization, and adds a larger dictionary size of up to 1 GiB with 64-bit WinRAR. Special optional compression algorithms optimized for RGB bitmaps, raw audio files, Itanium executables, and plain text, which were supported by earlier versions, are supported only in the older RAR format, not RAR5. Optional optimized compression of x86 executables and delta compression (for structured table data) are supported in both file formats.
 5.50 (2017-08): adds support for a master password which can be used to encrypt passwords stored in WinRAR. The default RAR format is changed to version 5. Adds support for decompressing Lzip archives; adds support for high precision file dates, longer file names and larger file sizes for TAR archives.
 5.60 (2018-06): repairing of protected RAR5 archives was improved. Automatic detection of the encoding of ZIP archive comments. Recognition of GZIP files with arbitrary preceding data as an actual GZIP archive.
 5.70 (2019-02): removes support for ACE archive decompression due to major security vulnerabilities in the unacev2.dll library.
 6.00 (2020-12): ""Ignore"" and ""Ignore All"" options are added to read error prompt. ""Ignore"" allows to continue processing with already read file part only and ""Ignore All"" does it for all future read errors.
 6.10 (2022-01): Dropped Windows XP support. Added support for unpacking ZST archives. Maximum recovery record is increased to 1000% of protected data size.

Operating systems support
More recent versions do not support many older operating systems. Versions supporting older operating systems may still be available, but not maintained:
 RAR 2.50 (1999) is the last version that supports MS-DOS and OS/2 on 16-bit x86 CPUs (8086-compatible).
 RAR 3.93 is the last version for MS-DOS and OS/2 on IA-32 CPUs (80386 equivalents and later). It supports file names longer than the MS-DOS standard of 8.3 characters, in a Windows DOS box (except under Windows NT), and uses the RSX DPMI extender.
 WinRAR 2.06 is the last version to support Windows 3.1, Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51 and Win32s.
 WinRAR 3.93 is the last version to support Windows 95, 98, ME, and NT 4.0. RAR for Pocket PC 3.93 is the last version for Windows Mobile.
 WinRAR 4.11 is the last version to support Windows 2000.
WinRAR 6.02 is the last version to support Windows XP.

269,28893722,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed%20Aerial%20Scout,Armed Aerial Scout,"The Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) was the planned replacement for the OH-58 Kiowa in United States Army service.

History
The Armed Aerial Scout program replaced the previous Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program, which chose the Bell ARH-70 Arapaho that was canceled due to cost overruns. An Analysis of Alternatives was conducted and a Request for Proposals was planned to be issued in 2014. The U.S. Army had until December 2012 to decide whether to proceed with the program. On 29 November 2012, Army officials decided to proceed with the Armed Aerial Scout program to acquire a new scout helicopter. On 8 January 2013, the Army began redrafting the presentation for the service's vice chief of staff before they move ahead with a competition. Vice Chief of Staff General Lloyd Austin III requested more data from the voluntary flight demonstrations done on helicopter entries, as well as taking into account the pace of other technologies, such as unmanned capabilities and future sensors. The Army concluded that its decision for the AAS program would result in either a new development effort or a service life-extension program (SLEP) for the OH-58F Kiowa.

Evaluations of commercial off-the-shelf designs were made from voluntary flight demonstrations in 2012. The five candidates included the OH-58F Block II, AH-6i, AAS-72X/X+, MD 540F, and AW139M (used for demonstration, with AW169 AAS offered as candidate). The Sikorsky S-97 Raider was offered, but no prototype was available for demonstration. Army evaluations concluded that no current aircraft met requirements. A decision on the Armed Aerial Scout program was expected ""in late summer or early fall"" 2013. Boeing had attempted to stop MD Helicopters from offering its MD 540F in the program, as it shared the same airframe design as Boeing's AH-6. In July 2013, MD Helicopters was allowed to continue to promote its offering in the program.

In October 2013, the Army said that the AAS program was at risk of being delayed or canceled due to sequestration cuts. The Armed Aerial Scout program ended in late 2013 with no alternative scout helicopter being selected for procurement. In 2012, Army leaders had thought a new aircraft was the best option. After sequestration in early 2013, the expected $16 billion cost of a new armed scout helicopter fleet was concluded to be too much. The Army then moved on with considerations for scrapping the entire OH-58 Kiowa fleet and moving more AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters to the active Army for use in the scouting role. AAS requirements for a scout helicopter with increased speed, range, payload, and the ability to fly  high at 35 °C (95 °F) temperatures will remain and whether one will be bought will depend on aircraft availability and Army funds. Even if the competition isn't reopened, the Army will develop a new scout helicopter as part of the Future Vertical Lift program.

Contenders

Contenders have included:
AAS-72X
In October 2010 a consortium of EADS North America, American Eurocopter and Lockheed Martin announced that it was preparing to fly the first of three AAS-72X prototypes. The design is in the same family as the Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota.

Bell OH-58F Block II
Upgrade of the current Kiowa Warrior.

Boeing AH-6S
Improved version of the MH-6 Little Bird

AgustaWestland AW109
Multipurpose light helicopter

Sikorsky S-97 Raider
In May 2009, Sikorsky unveiled a mock-up of its X2-based contender later given the company's S-97 designation.

OH-58D/AVX
Proposed by the AVX Aircraft Company is a modification of the current OH-58D design to meet the AAS requirement. The design uses the basic Kiowa fuselage and adds a counter-rotating coaxial rotor and two ducted fans.

Contenders by 2012
Candidate helicopters for interim replacement were to conduct flight demonstrations in spring 2012.

The contenders as of June 2012 were:
AgustaWestland AW139M - changed to AgustaWestland AW169 AAS
Boeing AH-6
EADS AAS-72X and AAS-72X+

Life and work 
His father was a prosperous merchant. He attended the Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium and studied philosophy at the . After that, he went to St. Gallen, where he learned the process of making canvases for painting, which was one of his father's principal stocks-in-trade. This proved to be an unsatisfying activity, one for which he was, perhaps, overeducated, so he returned to Mainz in 1818. There, he devoted himself to literary pursuits, which included producing a German translation of the Lay of the Last Minstrel, a long poem by Sir Walter Scott.

He initially wrote his poems in Standard German as well as in the Rhenish dialect. In his efforts to reproduce the dialect in detail, he made numerous visits to the rural areas surrounding Mainz, and took meticulous notes when he heard farmers selling their wares at the market near his home. In addition to his poems, he wrote works in the popular ""Posse mit Gesang"" (Farce with Singing) genre.

His works depict ordinary people, held up to a satirical mirror. Most represent a type known as the ""Palatinate Farmer"". His first published work came in 1824 with Etwas zum Lachen (Something to Laugh About), which was first sold anonymously at a local bookstore in Mainz. Later editions carried his name.

In January 1838, he became one of the founders of the . He died later that year, at the age of forty-one, from typhus.

His parents' home, where he was born, is still known as the ""Lennighaus"". A street has also been named after him. His younger brother, Adam Franz Lennig, was a Catholic theologian and served as a Dean.

273,5594239,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotominae,Phlebotominae,"The Phlebotominae are a subfamily of the family Psychodidae. In several countries, their common name is sandfly; but that name is also applied to other flies known as sandflies. The Phlebotominae include many genera of blood-feeding (hematophagous) flies, including the primary vectors of leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and pappataci fever. In the New World, leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus Lutzomyia, which commonly live in caves, where their main hosts are bats.  In the Old World, sand flies in the genus Phlebotomus spread leishmaniasis.

Phlebotomine females, and only females, suck blood from various mammals, reptiles and birds. Some species are selective, whereas others bite any suitable host they find. Some species can produce one clutch of eggs before their first blood meal; such females are said to practise autogenous or partly autogenous reproduction. Other species need a blood meal before they can produce any eggs at all; they are said to practise anautogenous reproduction. As far as is known, all species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs. Proteins and other nutrients in the blood they eat enable the female to produce the proteins and fats necessary for them to produce eggs after using up their bodily food stores.  In feeding on blood, the flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding. They then suck up the exposed blood.  Like practically all blood-feeding parasites, they inject biochemicals that inhibit blood clotting, plus some that stimulate host mast cells to produce histamine; this distends capillary vessels, thereby promoting blood flow.

One blood meal can support the production of about 100 eggs. Females lay their eggs in humid soil rich in organic matter. Laboratory colonies of various phlebotomine sand flies species have been established for experimental study.

Sand flies are small; a body size of about 3mm in length is typical for many species, which aids them in escaping notice. Their bite is not always felt, but leaves a small round, reddish bump that starts itching hours or days later.  Use of insect repellent is recommended in areas where sand flies are present.

Distribution 
Phlebotomine sand flies can be found between the latitudes 50°N and 40°S, but are absent from New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.

Health concerns 

As sand fly females suck blood from vertebrate animals, including humans, they can transmit leishmaniasis, arboviruses and bartonellosis.

Prevention of sand fly-borne diseases 
Both sand fly sexes are found to consume plant-derived sugar meals as a source of energy, and certain plants upon which sand flies feed can shorten their life or reduce their capacity for transmitting leishmaniasis. Therefore, the structure of plant communities is found to influence the transmission dynamics of sand fly-borne diseases. 

A next-generation sequencing (NGS)–based assay for determining the source of sand fly plant meals, based upon the chloroplast DNA gene ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (rbcL), found the predilection of several sand fly species, vectors of leishmaniasis in different parts of the world, prefer feeding on Cannabis sativa. The plant DNA detected in sand flies was from plant cells damaged by their mouthparts as they pierced plant tissues to reach the phloem. 

Pollinator insects, including mosquitoes, are attracted to plants that emit volatile molecules such as terpene, and sixty-eight volatile compounds were detected and partially characterized in pollen and vegetative parts of Cannabis sativa by GC-MS. As cannabinoids from C. sativa exhibit antimicrobial activity against some bacteria and fungi, and a potent antileishmanial, and since thriving gut microbiomes are crucial for the development of Leishmania infections in the sand fly gut, a microbicidal effect could harm the infections.

Therefore, a novel approach for controlling blood-sucking mosquitoes and sand flies could be to exploit their plant feeding habit by utilizing attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSBs) that emit olfactory cues to attract the sand flies and mosquitoes through the addition of C. sativa plant extracts, augmenting the efficacy of ATSBs for controlling sugar-questing disease vectors.

Veprik is considered one of the greatest composers of the ""Jewish school"" in Soviet music.

Life 
Veprik grew up in Warsaw and studied piano with Karl Wendling at the Leipzig Conservatory. At the onset of World War I, the family returned to Russia. Veprik studied composition with Alexander Zhitomirsky (1881–1937) in the Saint Petersburg Conservatory (1918–1921) and Nikolai Myaskovsky at the Moscow Conservatory (1921–1923).

Veprik was active in the musical life of 1920–1930s. In 1923 he was active in the creation of the Society for Jewish Music, a focal point for Jewish composers in Moscow, and Jewish music flourished as a result of the activities of the Society.  He taught at the Moscow Conservatory (1923–1941; professor from 1930; dean from 1938). In 1927 during a business trip in Austria, Germany and France, he met Arnold Schoenberg, Paul Hindemith, Maurice Ravel and Arthur Honegger. His music became well known in Europe and the United States during this time: nearly his entire oeuvre was performed by the Berlin Radio Symphony (1928–1929).  In March 1933 Arturo Toscanini conducted Veprik's Dances and Songs of the Ghetto at Carnegie Hall in New York.

Veprik was arrested as a ""Jewish nationalist"" in 1950, maltreated in prison and then deported to the Gulag. He was released from hard labor and instead had to organize an amateur orchestra among the prisoners.  In April 1954, Vepryk's case was reviewed and he was acquitted.  In September 1954 he returned sick and weary to Moscow, to a world in which Jewish culture had no place. Veprik composed a few works and wrote Principles of J.S. Bach's Orchestration (Принципы оркестровки И.-С. Баха).  He died on 13 October 1958 in Moscow.

Smith (born 28 June 1966) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Australian Football League (AFL) and the Port Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL).

Port Adelaide (1985–1990) 
Smith worked his way through the Port Adelaide's junior until he made seven senior appearances during the 1985 season. In 1986 Smith became a regular, first choice selection for Port Adelaide.

During the 1989 National Draft, Smith was selected by the Sydney Swans, from Port Adelaide, where he had been a member of premiership teams the years prior. The Swans selected him with pick 36. However he wouldn't play a senior game for the club.

St Kilda (1991) 
The following year he was traded from Sydney to St Kilda, in return for pick 58 in the 1990 AFL Draft. He was already 24 when he made his debut and appeared in a total of three games for St Kilda, in the 1991 season. His year with St Kilda was dogged by injury and returning to Adelaide he missed the 1990 SANFL Grand Final.

Port Adelaide (1992–1997) 
After his stint with St Kilda, Smith returned to his original club and took part in a further four Port Adelaide premierships, in 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996. He finished his Port Adelaide career with exactly 250 SANFL games.

282,7682407,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster%20veneer,Plaster veneer,"Plaster veneer (US terminology) or plaster skim (UK terminology) is a construction methodology for surfacing interior walls, by applying a thin layer of plaster over a substrate—typically over specially formulated gypsum board base, similar in nature to drywall.

History

 Until the mid twentieth century, it was standard practice in Western construction to surface interior walls using wooden lath and a layer of plaster about a half-inch thick (""lath and plaster""). Later, drywall became a standard. Typically, drywall is surfaced using the ""mud-and-tape"" method, where non-adhesive paper or mesh tape and drywall Joint compound  (""mud"") is used to fill joints, cover nail heads, and repair any flaws.

Plaster veneer was developed as a way of taking advantage of the reduced labor of modern drywall, while providing a genuine plaster surface for a wall.

Applications

In much of the world, plaster veneer is a very rare wall surface. Consequently, it can be difficult to find a local trade worker skilled in the practice. However, in some regions, such as Ireland, or Massachusetts this situation is reversed, with plaster veneer a common standard, and mud-and-tape the less common alternative. 

 Plaster veneer is well-suited to the renovation of older buildings, since it is an easier option than full re-creation of the original lath and plaster. The veneer surface will closely mimic antique walls, with their hand-applied variations. In contrast, properly finished mud-and-tape drywall can be very planar, and industrially uniform in character. Drywall feels relatively warm and soft to the touch, while plaster feels cooler and very hard. Consequently, plaster veneer might be an appropriate choice in the renovation of an older house with existing lath-and-plaster walls.

Bare mud-and-tape drywall is generally only acceptable as a final decorating finish in utility spaces such as attics or garages. In most rooms, such walls are finished with paint or wallpaper. Plaster veneer walls are usually similarly decorated, but unpainted plaster can also serve as a finish. Because bare plaster can be appealing to the touch, and paint would add an additional layer, some decorators opt to leave exposed plaster in some or all of a room, as a creative choice. In such cases, if the plaster's natural color is not desired, tints can be added as part of the mixing process, or can be introduced unevenly for artistic color effects.

Methodology

 The plaster veneer method begins with the hanging of specially designated drywall (""blueboard""), in the conventional manner., N.B. In North America, the color of the face paper of drywall indicates its intended application: white for standard, green for moisture resistance, etc. Plaster veneer wallboard is blue or gray .  Plaster veneer may also be applied to ordinary drywall, or over existing walls, but this requires ""gluing"" the existing wall surface by painting on a special adhesive compound, and then applying a thin layer of ""base coat"" plaster. After the blueboard or base coat covers the interior of a room, the finishing plaster is mixed in batches (typically about 5 gallons), by blending plaster powder with water, to the ideal consistency. Working quickly, a thin layer (usually one to three millimeters) of finish plaster is applied over a wall face before the plaster begins to congeal in the bucket. Over a period of a few hours, as the plaster chemically sets on the wall, it is periodically smoothed or textured using hand trowels, until the desired finish is achieved. When a wall face has sufficiently set, an adjoining face can be safely applied. After the plaster has fully set, it is allowed to cure for a period of days to weeks, permitting excess moisture to escape into the air. If the plaster is no more than about three millimeters thick, two to three days' cure time is usually sufficient. A skilled eye can see areas where moisture is lingering until the curing is complete. After the walls are fully cured, they are ideal for painting or papering.

Advantages of plaster veneer

Some considerations favor plaster veneer over mud-and-tape drywall.

Moisture resistance: Once cured, plaster is an effective water barrier. By contrast, unprotected drywall and joint compound absorb water, causing sagging, bloating, or complete structural failure. As a consequence of plaster's inherent water shedding properties, it is a very effective water and mildew barrier.

No sanding: Plaster is typically applied in one work session per wall or per several non-adjoining walls. The smoothness or texture is achieved by working the plaster as it sets, over a period of up to five hours. By contrast, drywall is typically sanded or otherwise mechanically smoothed as the final step of the wall surfacing process. The fine dust particles created can be difficult to clean and dangerous to breathe.

Pleasing surface: Bare plaster can be a beautiful interior surface. The natural color of veneer plaster is a mottled white. When applied for maximum smoothness, it can result in a hard, mirror-like surface, which masks the mechanical uniformity of the drywall with the subtly organic form of a hand-applied layer. Tinting can be added to the wet plaster for color effects.

Durable surface: Plaster veneer results in a harder and more durable surface than drywall.  Scuffs and gouges are less likely.

Quicker: The overall calendar time from beginning to end for a plaster veneer project is typically slightly shorter than for conventional drywall.(N.B. The overall labor time is usually less with mud-and-tape drywall.) This is because drywall joint compound is applied in at least three phases, followed by sanding. Some drywall joint compounds (""hot mud"") set chemically, allowing rapid re-coating, but these compounds can make sanding more difficult. By contrast, each wall in a plaster veneer project is applied as a single task, and allowed to set and cure without intervention.

Disadvantages of plaster veneer

Some considerations make plaster veneer a less appropriate choice than mud-and-tape drywall.

Rare technique: In most locales, there are few trade professionals with the skills for plaster veneer. Where drywall is much more common, it can be difficult even to acquire plastering tools and materials from local suppliers. After a wall is surfaced with plaster, any future work on that wall should ideally be done by a craftsperson familiar with plaster veneer.

Application time commitment: Once a plaster wall is begun, it must be completed before the worker can stop. This time commitment makes scheduling each task more critical, and can cause a worker to end the work day early or late.

Cure time: There is only a 24-hour wait time to decorate over ""one coat"" veneer. Cure time is only for two or three coat plastering that may have lime in the finish. It is recommended to wait a few days or weeks before painting a lime finish wall. Plastering walls with one coat is actually faster than taping since you don't have to wait for three separate coats to dry for 24 hours, as in taping. If heavy patchwork is involved, then yes, there is also a wait time. However, that is typically for drying time not curing.

More expensive: In comparable settings, the costs of plaster veneer walls is higher than mud-and-tape drywall walls. That is, a skilled tradesman working start to finish at full efficiency can surface mud-and-tape with somewhat less labor than with plaster veneer.  Additionally, plaster veneer uses significantly more plaster material than the amount of joint compound in a typical mud-and-tape wall.

293,36003014,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke%20Tai%20of%20Tian%20Qi,Duke Tai of Tian Qi,"Duke Tai of Tian Qi (; died 384 BC) was from 386 to 384 BC ruler of the State of Qi, a major power during the Warring States period of ancient China.  He was the first Qi ruler from the House of Tian, replacing the House of Jiang that had ruled the state for over six centuries.

Duke Tai's personal name was Tian He (田和), and ancestral name Gui (媯).  His official posthumous title was simply Duke Tai of Qi, but he is commonly called Duke Tai of Tian Qi or Duke Tai of Tian to be distinguished from Jiang Ziya, the original Duke Tai from the House of Jiang, who founded Qi in the 11th century BC.

Reign
Since Tian He's great-grandfather Tian Heng killed Duke Jian of Qi in 481 BC, the leaders of the Tian clan had been the de facto rulers of Qi.  In 404 BC Tian He succeeded his older brother Tian Daozi as head of the Tian clan.  He nominally served under Duke Kang of Qi, the last ruler from the House of Jiang, but effectively ruled the state himself.

Tian He asked Marquis Wu of Wei to lobby for him at the court of King An of Zhou, the nominal ruler of all China.  In 386 BC, King An officially recognized Tian He as ruler of Qi, ending more than six centuries of rule by the House of Jiang.  Tian He became the first de jure ruler of Qi from the House of Tian, and is posthumously known as Duke Tai of Qi.  He subsequently exiled Duke Kang to a seaside city, where Duke Kang lived for seven more years and died in 379 BC.

Duke Tai died in 384 BC, just two years after formally ascending the throne.  He was succeeded by his son Tian Yan, who would later be killed by Duke Tai's younger son Tian Wu, Duke Huan of Tian Qi.

Mausoleum
Duke Tai's mausoleum is located near the village of Chengjiagou (程家沟) in Putong Township (普通乡) of Qingzhou, Shandong Province.  The extant structure measures  from east to west,  from north to south, and  high.  The seven known mausoleums of Tian Qi rulers are now protected as a National Historical and Cultural Site.  Since 2008 they have been included in the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as part of the ancient Qi capital and mausoleum complex.

296,34774157,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano%20Sala,Emiliano Sala,"Emiliano Raúl Sala Taffarel (; 31 October 1990 – 21 January 2019) was an Argentine professional footballer who played as a forward.

After playing youth football in Argentina and following a short spell in Portugal's regional leagues, Sala began his professional career in France with Bordeaux, making his professional debut in February 2012. After struggling to break into the first team, he was loaned out to Championnat National side Orléans and Ligue 2 side Niort in consecutive seasons. He enjoyed prolific spells with both clubs, scoring 39 goals between them, before returning to Bordeaux. After initially being promised an increased role after his successful loans, Sala fell out of favour again, and instead, joined fellow Ligue 1 side Caen on loan.

In 2015, he signed for Nantes on a permanent basis. With Nantes, he made more than 100 appearances in Ligue 1, and achieved a successful goalscoring record, finishing as the club's top goalscorer for three consecutive seasons. His form prompted a move to Cardiff City in January 2019, for a club record fee of £15 million (€18 million).

Sala died in a plane crash off Alderney on 21 January 2019. He was a passenger aboard a Piper Malibu light aircraft flying from Nantes to Cardiff. An initial three-day search covered  across the English Channel. Two subsequent private searches were launched, resulting in the discovery of the wreckage on 3 February; Sala's body was recovered four days later.

Early life and personal life
Sala was born in the town of Cululú, Santa Fe Province, Argentina, to Horacio Sala and Mercedes Taffarel. His father worked as a truck driver; the family later moved to Progreso. He held an Italian passport. He had a brother, Dario, and a sister, Romina. He was a fan of Independiente and, while growing up, he studied footage of his favourite footballer, Gabriel Batistuta.  Sala's father, Horacio, died of a heart attack on 26 April 2019, three months after his son's death.

Professional career

Early career
Sala began playing football for San Martín de Progreso, where he remained until he was 15 years old. He then moved to San Francisco, Córdoba to play at football school Proyecto Crecer after being spotted by a scout. The club was directly affiliated with Spanish club RCD Mallorca and French side FC Girondins de Bordeaux, scouting local players in the area. After joining the club, he moved into a boarding house with other players from the club's youth system. He played six Preferente matches for Spanish club CD Soledad B between October 2007 and February 2008.

In 2009, while living in Granada, Spain, he was recommended to Portuguese District side FC Crato by a fellow Argentinian footballer who played there and joined the Portuguese team. Sala played one official match for Crato, scoring twice, but suddenly decided to leave the club and return to Argentina, saying that his girlfriend was ""in trouble"" in his homeland.

Bordeaux
At the age of 20, during the 2010–11 season, Sala moved to Europe to sign for Bordeaux, the French partner club from Proyecto Crecer. After arriving in France, Sala briefly lived with the club's youth coach Marcelo Vada and his son, Sala's teammate, Valentín Vada, who were from the same region of Argentina.

Having progressed through the club's reserve team, Sala grew frustrated with his lack of first-team playing time, and his agent offered him to several Italian clubs, including Sorrento, but this was rejected in each case. On 8 February 2012, Sala made his Bordeaux senior competitive debut in the 2011–12 Coupe de France round of 16 3–1 away defeat against Olympique Lyonnais, coming on as a substitute in the 105th minute for Jussiê.

Unable to establish himself in the first team, Bordeaux hoped to loan Sala out in order to gain experience and he was expected to sign for a team in Spain before his agent rejected the move, wanting Sala to remain in France. He instead joined Championnat National side US Orléans on loan after being spotted by manager Oliver Frapolli a year previously. Frapolli described Sala as ""the best player on the team, without question"", as he went on to score nineteen goals for the club in 37 appearances. He helped the club to an eighth-place finish in the Championnat National.

On 2 July 2013, Sala agreed a deal to join Ligue 2 club Chamois Niortais on loan for the entire 2013–14 season. He enjoyed a steady return through the first half of the season before finding form in March, scoring eleven goals in his final twelve appearances including scoring his first career hat-trick in a 4–2 victory over Stade Lavallois. He finished the season with 20 goals in all competitions, with his total of 18 league goals setting a new club record for goals in a single season.

At the start of the 2014–15 season, Sala was brought into the first team squad with Bordeaux by manager Willy Sagnol and was rewarded with a two-year extension to his contract. He scored his first senior goal for the club after converting a penalty during a 4–1 defeat to Monaco. However, it proved to be his only goal in eleven appearances, and he was loaned to SM Caen, another Ligue 1 club, for the second half of the 2014–15 season as a replacement for Mathieu Duhamel. Caen had previously tried to sign Sala at the start of the season but had been rejected by Bordeaux. He made his debut for Caen on 1 February 2015 in a 1–0 victory over Saint-Étienne. He scored his first goal for the club in his third appearance, during a 2–2 draw with Paris Saint-Germain two weeks later, and scored a brace against RC Lens in his following match. He scored five goals for Caen during his loan spell before returning to Bordeaux.

Nantes

On 20 July 2015, Sala joined Ligue 1 club Nantes on a five-year contract with Nantes paying a reported transfer fee of €1 million to Bordeaux. He made his debut for Nantes on the opening day of the 2015–16 season, during a 1–0 victory over Guingamp, and scored his first goal for the club on 5 December 2015 in a 1–1 draw with Ajaccio. In January 2016, Nantes rejected a bid of £3 million from Wolverhampton Wanderers for Sala. In his first season, despite scoring only six times, he finished the year as the club's top goalscorer.

During his second season, Sala scored twelve league goals for Nantes, the highest scoring player in a single season for the club since Olivier Monterrubio in 2000–01. He equaled his tally again in the 2017–18 season, finishing as Nantes' top scorer for the third consecutive season since his arrival at the club.

At the start of the 2018–19 season, Sala fell out of favour under new manager Miguel Cardoso who preferred Kalifa Coulibaly as the club's first choice striker. Turkish side Galatasaray made a late bid to sign Sala on the last day of the summer transfer window but the move later collapsed. Sala twice made goalscoring appearances as a substitute and was restored to the starting line up under Cardoso before the manager was sacked in October 2018. Vahid Halilhodžić was appointed as the club's new manager and in his first match in charge, on 20 October 2018, Sala scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 Ligue 1 home win over Toulouse. He thus became the first FC Nantes player to score three goals in a Ligue 1 match since Mamadou Diallo did so against FC Sochaux-Montbéliard in February 2006. At the end of October, he was voted Ligue 1 Player of the Month having scored four goals in three matches during the month.

Sala's good form saw him as the joint-highest goalscorer in Ligue 1 at the start of December, his tally of twelve goals tied with Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappé. On 5 December, Sala scored his last goal for the club in a 3–2 Ligue 1 home victory over Olympique de Marseille. On 16 January 2019, he played his final match for the club in a 1–0 Ligue 1 away defeat against Nîmes Olympique.

In 2021, it was announced that a pre-season tournament would be held in July in Sala's honour, with Nantes, Bordeaux, Caen and Niort invited to play by former Orléans goalkeeper and ex-teammate of Sala, Thomas Renault.

Cardiff City 

On 19 January 2019, Sala joined Premier League side Cardiff City on a three and a half-year deal for a club record transfer fee, reported to be £15 million. The transfer beat the previous club record of £11 million paid for Gary Medel in 2013. As part of a sell-on clause, 50% of the transfer fee was due to his first professional club Bordeaux. Sala rejected a late bid from a club in the Chinese Super League to join Cardiff, despite being offered a higher salary, due to his desire to play in the Premier League. Following Sala's death, Nantes demanded the transfer fee from Cardiff. In September 2019, FIFA ruled in Nantes' favour and ordered Cardiff to pay a first instalment of €6 million (£5.3 million), and the remainder the following January. In December 2019, Cardiff City launched an appeal against FIFA's decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Disappearance and death

After completing his medical at Cardiff, Sala returned to Nantes on Saturday 19 January, on a plane arranged by football agent Mark McKay. His intention was to return to Cardiff on Monday 21 January, in order to attend his first training session with his new club the following morning. Sala had been invited to attend Cardiff's match against Newcastle United by manager Neil Warnock, but he returned to France to say goodbye to his Nantes teammates and collect personal belongings.

On 21 January, the Piper Malibu aircraft, which was flying Sala from Nantes to Cardiff, disappeared off Alderney. The same aircraft and pilot had flown Sala to Nantes two days earlier. On 23 January, Channel Islands Air Search reported that there was ""no hope"" of finding any survivors in the water.

An audio message, allegedly sent from the plane by Sala to his friends via WhatsApp, was released by Argentine media outlet Olé. The audio message translates as follows:

Guernsey Police initially searched for three days about  across the English Channel. At 15:15 GMT on 24 January 2019, after a ""very thorough and extensive search"" including eighty hours of combined searching undertaken by three planes, five helicopters and two lifeboats, the police announced that they had called off the search for the aircraft or any survivors. The decision led to calls worldwide for the search to continue, including numerous other footballers, among them fellow Argentine players Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero and former player Diego Maradona. The president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, stated his intention to request the British and French governments to resume the search. An online petition also attracted over 65,000 signatures and Sala's family later announced their decision to fund a private search. Over £280,000 was raised for this search on GoFundMe started by Sports Cover, a sports agency that represented Sala. The funds enabled the private search to commence on 26 January, with the launch of two boats, led by marine scientist David Mearns.

On 28 January, plans were announced for an underwater search to begin ""within a week"", dependent on weather conditions, using an unmanned remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to search an area of seabed north of Hurd's Deep. On 29 January, Cardiff City included Sala on the team sheet for their game against Arsenal, with a daffodil next to his name in place of a squad number. On 30 January, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) reported that they had found two seat cushions washed up on a French beach, which were believed to be from the missing aircraft.

On 3 February, another underwater search for the aircraft began, using the AAIB's Geo Ocean III vessel and a privately funded vessel, which were conducting sonar surveys of the seabed. The planned search, lasting three days, would cover an area of , about  north of Guernsey. At approximately 21:11 GMT, six hours after the new search began, wreckage from the aircraft was found at a depth of . On 4 February, investigators stated that there was one body visible inside the wreckage.

On 7 February, the body was recovered from the wreckage and taken to the Isle of Portland to be passed to the Dorset coroner. Later that day, Dorset Police identified the body as Sala's by means of fingerprint evidence. Nantes subsequently retired his former number 9 jersey.

On 11 February, the results of a post mortem reported that Sala had died of ""head and trunk injuries"". Sala's body was taken back to Argentina on 15 February 2019 and his funeral was held, in his hometown of Progreso, the following day.

On 25 February 2019, a Special Bulletin was issued by the AAIB, giving a radar track of final section of flight including photographs of the wreckage on the sea-bed. It examined, in some detail, the regulatory framework for the accident flight.

On 28 February, ex-football agent Willie McKay, who had arranged the flight, said that Sala had been ""abandoned"" by Cardiff City and was left to arrange his own travel. McKay's son Mark was Nantes' acting agent in the deal for Sala. The football club said they ""strongly reject"" the claim they neglected to provide Sala with travel arrangements.

On 29 April, two people were arrested after a photograph purporting to show the dead body of Emiliano Sala during a post-mortem was posted on Twitter.

On 19 June 2019, Dorset Police announced that they had arrested a man on suspicion of manslaughter by an unlawful act in respect of the death of Sala. His identity was not made public, but several newspapers identified the man as pilot David Henderson, who arranged the flight and had originally intended to fly the plane. On 11 March 2020, it was reported that no further action would be taken against the man. However, in October 2021, Henderson was prosecuted and found guilty to arranging a flight without permission or authorisation and of endangering the safety of an aircraft.

On 14 August, it was reported that toxicology tests on Sala's body showed high levels of exposure to carbon monoxide, and the AAIB considered it was likely that the pilot would also have been exposed to the gas, potentially leading to drowsiness or unconsciousness.

In 2021, a competition called the Challenge Emiliano Sala was created in honour of Sala. It was contested between four of Sala's former clubs in France, with Bordeaux winning the first title.

Style of play
Sala stated that he modelled his style on his idol, former Argentine international forward Gabriel Batistuta. BBC Sport compared Sala to Jamie Vardy, describing him as ""a player who likes wide spaces and being part of a team that has a strong counter-attacking style."" A large and powerful striker, he was also recognised for his ability to hold the ball up and was described as possessing ""reasonable"" pace; he also drew praise in the media for his work-rate, tenacity, eye for goal, and finishing ability.

Built with a combination of iron rods and wood over the Gilgit River, the Alam Bridge is regarded as one of the scariest bridges in the world. The bridge linking Baltistan region to Gilgit and the rest of the country is about 300 metres in length.

This wooden, wire suspension bridge over the Gilgit River was built by Chinese and Pakistani engineers in 1978. In view of its dangers, regional authorities are deployed at the bridge to ensure vehicles do not exceed the speed limit. In addition, trucks and other loaded vehicles weighing more than 20 tons are not allowed to pass.

305,31555222,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th%20Mounted%20Division,4th Mounted Division,"The 4th Mounted Division was a short-lived Yeomanry Division of the British Army active during World War I.  It was formed on 20 March 1916, converted to 2nd Cyclist Division in July 1916 and broken up on 16 November 1916.  It remained in England on Home Defence duties throughout its existence.

History

4th Mounted Division
The 4th Mounted Division was formed on 20 March 1916 from three 2nd Line mounted brigades (2/1st Eastern, 2/1st South Eastern and 2/1st South Western) and the new 2/1st Southern Mounted Brigade.  The Headquarters was at Colchester and Brigadier-General (Major-General from 26 May) Lord Lovat was appointed to command.  The brigades were stationed at Wivenhoe, Canterbury, Kelvedon and Manningtree; they were numbered as 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th Mounted Brigades, respectively, on 31 March.  Being formed relatively late, it did not appear to suffer the same organizational problems (lack of equipment and personnel) as other 2nd Line divisions, for example the 1st and 2/2nd Mounted Divisions.

2nd Cyclist Division
In July 1916 there was a major reorganization of 2nd Line yeomanry units in the United Kingdom.  All but 12 regiments were converted to cyclists: the rest were dismounted, handed over their horses to the remount depots and were issued with bicycles.  The 4th Mounted Division was reorganized as the 2nd Cyclist Division, now commanding the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Cyclist Brigades.  On reorganisation, 14th Mounted Brigadewith 2/1st Hertfordshire, 2/1st Queen's Own West Kent and 2/1st Essex Yeomanrywas posted to the new 1st Mounted Division (3rd Mounted Division redesignated) where it formed the new 3rd Mounted Brigade and remained mounted.  In exchange, the 10th Mounted Brigade (2/1st South Midland) joined as the 8th Cyclist Brigade.

The Headquarters remained at Colchester and the brigades at Wivenhoe, Kelvedon, Manningtree and West Malling.  It was assigned to the Southern Army, Home Defence Troops, and Lord Lovat remained in command.  The Headquarters moved to Ipswich in September 1916 and the brigade were now at Wivenhoe, Wingham, Woodbridge and Ipswich.

A further reorganization in November 1916 saw the 2nd Cyclist Division broken up. The cyclist brigades were dispersed and the yeomanry regiments were amalgamated in pairs to form Yeomanry Cyclist Regiments in new cyclist brigades.  The division had remained in England on Home Defence duties throughout its brief existence.

Life 
His parents were George I ""the Pious"" of Hesse-Darmstadt (1547–1596) and Magdalene of Lippe (1552–1587).  Philip's first wife was Anna Margaretha of Diepholz; she died childless in 1629 and was buried in the town church at Butzbach.  He married his second wife, Christina Sophia of East Frisia (born: 1609 in Aurich, died 1658 in Frankfurt), in 1632 in Aurich.

When his father died in 1596, the country was divided into three parts.  Hesse-Darmstadt, like many royal courts, practised primogeniture, meaning that the oldest son inherited the country and his younger brothers were compensated with money, or, if no money was available, a much smaller, non-sovereign, territory and less money.  The younger sons were allowed to use the title of ""Landgrave"", but sovereignty remained with the eldest son.  In this case, eldest son, Louis V ""the faithful"" inherited the bulk of the country.  Frederick received Homburg and founded the Hesse-Homburg line.  Philip received Butzbach.

His Landgraviate of Butzback initially consisted only of the town of Butzbach and som nearby villages.  A quarter of Solms-Braunfels was added during the Thirty Years' War, when the Count of Solms-Braunfels had fallen into disfavour with the Emperor.  In 1639, the town of Itter in Waldeck was added, with the castle at Vöhl and the villages that belonged to the castle.  At that time, however, Philip's annual jointer of  was reduced by 7300 guilders.

The new residence Butzbach flourished in the middle of the Thirty Years' War.  Landgrave Philip was a learned and well-traveled man; he spoke eight languages, was a mathematician and collected a valuable library.  For astronomical studies, he built an observatory in his Landgraviate Castle in Butzbach and had some astronomical instruments made.  In 1618, he appointed Daniel Mögling (alias Theophilus Schweighart), who was a Rosicrucian and medical doctor and a member of a family of professors from Tübingen, as a court mathematician and court astronomer.  Mogling, who also translated Philip Sidney's Arcadia brought him into contact with Wilhelm Schickard (1592–1635), who had invented a calculating machine in 1623.  Philip III also corresponded with the astronomers Kepler and Galileo.  He had met the 17 years older Galileo during his two trips to Italy in 1602 and 1607.  Kepler visited Butzabch twice, in July 1621 and in October 1627.  Philip III and Kepler observed the size of sunspots together and in 1624, Philip printed Kepler's .  Kepler's daughter Susan also visited the court at Butzbach several times.

Philip expanded his castle and surrounded it with a pleasure garden and a tree garden.  Neither garden has survived.  The largest attraction in the garden was the ""planet fountain"".  Drawings of this fountain, a painting and a description have survived and a model was constructed recently.

Philip III died in 1643 during a sweating treatment at Bad Ems, which his physician Johann Schröder had prescribed a year earlier.  During his treatment, some alcohol caught fire, due to carelessness of the barber.  Philip III suffered severe burns and died from his wounds shortly afterwards.

Since both of his marriages had been childless, the Landgraviate of Butzbach fell back to Hesse-Darmstadt after just one generation.  His second wife, Christina Sophia, remained on the castle in Butzbach until her death.

The Van Vleck House was built by Roy Van Vleck, operator of the first ""mercantile"", or general store, in Jackson. Roy and his new wife, Genevieve Lawton Van Vleck lived in the cabin from 1911 to 1960. The Van Vleck house was notable at the time for possessing its own well, which served much of the surrounding population. In 1920 Genevieve became one of the members of the first all-female town council in the United States, serving until 1923. Roy Van Vleck was the local land commissioner and served on the hospital and school boards. Van Vleck was also a leader of the opposition to the creation and expansion of Grand Teton National Park in the 1930s.

The house is a one-story log cabin. The approximately  by  L-shaped house was moved  after a 1988 fire and set on a new foundation. It retains its orientation and context. The interior did not survive the fire and has been reconstructed. The barn, which is a few years newer than the house, stands nearby. The barn includes a central brick chimney and is used for storage. The barn was the location for the final fight scene featuring Clint Eastwood in the 1980 movie Every Which Way But Loose.

In 1980 the house became a restaurant. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995, and is the only authentic historical structure in the central area of Jackson.

Barn removal
In August 2009 work began to dismantle the barn for removal and reconstruction at a new site south of Jackson.  The removal of the barn was approved by the town of Jackson, but the town requested that demolition be stopped to allow a review when it was revealed that the town's list of historic properties did not include the barn, despite its inclusion on the National Register. The owners of the site did not have immediate plans for the property and stated that they wished to ""clean up the block.""

The party was originally founded on 22 November 2019 as an electoral alliance to run in the 2020 parliamentary election and was called Hungarian Community Co-operation (MKÖ-MKS; ; ). MKÖ-MKS consisted of the ""Összefogás–Spolupatričnosť"" movement, SMK-MKP and the Hungarian Forum.

History

Összefogás – Spolupatričnosť

The party began to form in the autumn of 2019, citing disputes between the Hungarian parties as a reason for its formation, which may cause the Hungarian minority not to be represented on the National Council after the next elections. Former Member of the European Parliament for SMK-MKP Edit Bauer and former Deputy Chairman of MNI Gábor Zászlós.

MKÖ-MKS

In connection with the upcoming parliamentary elections, the members of the Összefogás–Spolupatričnosť negotiated on electoral cooperation with four other ethnic Hungarian parties (Most–Híd, SMK-MKP, MKDA-MKDSZ the MF-MF). On 24 November 2019, the Összefogás–Spolupatričnosť approved the joint action of the Hungarian parties in the parliamentary elections. The Összefogás–Spolupatričnosť was transformed into MKS, and gained 30 seats on the candidate list. Szabolcs Mózes, the party president, ran second on the list, Örs Orosz, the party vice president, ran sixth, and József Nagy, former MEP, ran ninth. President Mózes stated that they were joining together to ensure the representation of the Hungarian minority and to contribute to the change of government and the removal of the Smer-SD party from power.

After the failure of all Hungarian parties in the 2020 parliamentary election, the MKÖ-MKS, SMK-MKP , and Most–Híd held negotiations on further cooperation. On August 20, 2020, they signed a declaration of cooperation in Komárno. In March 2021, they announced that the negotiations had been successful and that they were preparing to establish a new party ""Aliancia – Szövetség"". If the situation allows, the Alliance should emerge as a new party, and if not, it will be renamed the MKÖ-MKS party. In the new party, the post of chairman would be filled by SMK-MKP, the post of chairman of the Republican Council by Most–Híd, and the post of expert vice-chairman by MKÖ-MKS.

Aliancia – Szövetség

The Aliancia – Szövetség was officially formed by merging the parties SMK-MKP, Most–Híd and MKÖ-MKS at the assembly in Šamorín on 2 October 2021. The assembly was preceded by two years of negotiations between five Hungarian political parties on the possibility of cooperation. The goal of joining forces was declared as a return to parliament after the next election, or to be part of the governing coalition.

Krisztián Forró, the current chairman of the SMK-MKP, became the chairman of the party, and the current chairman of the MKÖ-MKS Szabolcs Mózes was elected vice-chairman. In addition to the chairmen, the chairman of the Republican Council, László Sólymos, the current chairman of the Most–Híd party, was elected, as well as the vice-chairman and chairmen of the platforms, members of the republican presidency, republican committee and mandatory commissions. Sólymos said: ""We have laid the foundations for the political, parliamentary representation of the Hungarians, the nationalities and the regions in which we live"". The Alliance declared a strategic orientation of the state, such as support for the EU, NATO and Visegrad Four membership. The Alliance ruled out any cooperation with the People's Party Our Slovakia and Direction – Slovak Social Democracy.

The Chamber watches over proper performance of tax advisory services, regulates activities of tax advisers, creates preconditions for improvement of their qualification, offers its members a wide range of various services, protects and promotes their rightful interests and helps to form a suitable environment for tax advisers' work.

Constitution
The Chamber is an independent professional organization of tax advisers. Its existence is given by the Tax Advisory Services and the Chamber of Tax Advisers of the Czech Republic Act no. 523/1992 Coll., which came into effect on 1 December 1992. This act regulates both the position and activities of tax advisers and the activity of the Chamber itself. The Tax Advisory Services Act guarantees demanded professional standards of the profession, regulates the position of the Chamber of Tax Advisers, rights and duties of tax advisers and defines tax advisory services themselves as provision of legal help and financial-economic advice concerning taxes, tax payments, duties and other payments as well as concerning things associated directly with taxes.
Pursuant to this act, only those individuals who are listed on the list of the Chamber of Tax Advisers of the Czech Republic can be considered as tax advisers. Tax advisers are compulsory members of the Chamber by law.

The autonomous character of the Chamber is an important feature which ensures the independence of the Chamber and at the same time it is a precondition for its high professional level.

Performance of tax advisory services
The regulation of performance of tax advisory services has its basis in the law and subsequently in the Statutes of the Chamber. Pursuant to the Tax Advisory Services Act, only those individuals who are listed on the list of the Chamber of Tax Advisers of the Czech Republic can be considered as tax advisers. Tax adviser is entitled and obliged to protect rights and rightful interests of his/her client. He/she is obliged to act honestly and conscientiously, to use all legal means consistently and to apply everything he/she considers to be beneficial in accordance with his/her own conscience and client's order. Tax advisory services are based on independence, high professional qualification and tax advisers guarantee extensive professional confidentiality and full responsibility for potential harm to their clients.

An important legislative change in the field of tax advisory services was brought by the amendment of Tax Advisory Services and the Chamber of Tax Advisers Act no. 523/1992 Coll., with effect from the 1st of July 2008. This amendment regulates the position of legal entities entitled to perform tax advisory services. The amendment responds to the change of the Administration of Taxes Act from 2007, by which the legislative term “tax adviser” has involved also legal entities entitled to provide tax advisory services, and thus has enabled these legal entities to represent clients in tax procedures to the same extent to which tax advisers can do that. These legal entities are not members of the Chamber. The Chamber records them on a special list and, as providers of tax advisory services, these legal entities must observe the Act no. 523/1992 Coll.

It was self-released on May 1, 2011, and re-released in February 2017, by Yeah We On Entertainment. The majority of the mixtape is self-produced, and features guest production and vocals from Lil Ugly Mane, Main Attrakionz, Supa Sortahuman, and J.K. the Reaper. The artwork was created by Lil Ugly Mane and Chino Amobi.

Background 
The mixtape pays homage to the hip hop scene of the 1990s. One of the influences for the album is the hip hop group Three 6 Mafia, which can be heard in the songs ""Suck a Nigga Dick for 2011"" and ""Pheel tha Phonk 1990"", and on its cover which was based on the classical Memphis Pen and Pixel style of covers. It features chopped and screwed vocals in some tracks along with game and movie samples such as Mortal Kombat screams and Godzilla sound effects which creates an experimental ambience throughout the mixtape.  Themes on this Mixtape stem from sex to drug abuse, while doing so, over Lo-Fi, trap instrumentals.  Spaceghostpurrp uses Southern Slang throughout the whole album while using extremely vulgar lyrics.

Reception
Blackland Radio 66.6 had a limited acclaim therefore obtaining sparse reviews. Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork, rated the mixtape 7.1 rating out of 10, stating ""Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (1991) is a mess of Three 6 Mafia-chanting, woozy Wu-Tang loops, DJ Screw wheeze, and Mortal Kombat and Godzilla sound effects, all paired with an off-the-dome rapping style that's equal parts Lil Wayne and Lil B"".

Sputnik Music provided a favourable 4.0 out 5. The Miami New Times recognized Blackland Radio 66.6 in its Miami's Ten Best Local Albums, EPs, and Mixtapes of 2011 article, with an in-depth review stating, ""The Carol City boy takes his raw rap style to the next dimension with touches of horrorcore, dabbling songs with a feminine screech and a Vincent Price-like laugh. He even gets barebones experimental, leaving hardly a beat on his track Get Yah Head Bust.""

324,1245624,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coryat%27s%20Crudities,Coryat's Crudities,"is a travelogue published in 1611 by Thomas Coryat (sometimes also spelled ""Coryate"" or ""Coriat"") of Odcombe, an English traveller and mild eccentric.

History 
The book is an account of a journey undertaken, much of it on foot, in 1608 through France, Italy, Germany, and other European countries.  Coryat conceived of the 1,975-mile (3,175 km) voyage to Venice and back in order to write the subsequent travelogue dedicated to Henry, Prince of Wales, at whose court he was regarded as somewhat of a buffoon and jester, rather than the wit and intellectual he considered himself. The extent to which Coryat invited such ridicule in pursuit of patronage and court favour is unclear.

The year 1608, when Coryat made his journey, was a period of relative peace in France following the end of both the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), and the Franco-Spanish War (1595–1598) in northern France. Coryat's anecdotes of how the Spanish took Calais in 1596, and Amiens with a bag of walnuts in 1597, were recent events in 1608.

Among other things, Coryat's book introduced the use of the fork to England and, in its support of continental travel, helped to popularize the idea of the Grand Tour that rose in popularity later in the century. The book also included what is likely the earliest English rendering of the legend of William Tell.

The work is particularly important to music historians for giving extraordinary details of the activities of the Venetian School, one of the most famous and progressive contemporary musical movements in Europe.  The work includes an elaborate description of the festivities at the church of San Rocco in Venice, with polychoral and instrumental music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Bartolomeo Barbarino, and others.

The book appeared with engravings by William Hole, and the author received a pension.

Crudities was only twice reprinted at the time, so the first edition is quite rare today. Later, ""modern"" facsimiles were put out, in 1776 and 1905, which included the later trip to Persia & India.

""Commendatory"" verses
A custom of Renaissance humanists was to contribute commendatory verses that would preface the works of their friends. In the case of this book, a playful inversion of this habit led to a poetic collection that firstly refused to take the author seriously; and then took on a life of its own. Prince Henry as Coryat's patron controlled the situation; and willy-nilly Coryat had to accept the publication with his book of some crudely or ingeniously false panegyrics from 55 contemporary wits and poets of his acquaintance, including John Donne, Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones, and Thomas Roe. Further, the book was loaded with another work, Henry Peacham's Sights and Exhibitions of England, complete with a description of a perpetual motion machine by Cornelis Drebbel.

There were poems in seven languages. Donne wrote in an English/French/Italian/Latin/Spanish macaronic language. Peacham's was in what he called ""Utopian"", which was partly gibberish, and the pseudonymous Glareanus Vadianus (tentatively John Sanford) wrote something close to literary nonsense. The contribution of John Hoskyns is called by Noel Malcolm ""the first specimen of full-blown literary English nonsense poetry in the seventeenth century"".

In the same year that the book was published, a pirate version of the verses appeared, published by Thomas Thorpe, under the title The Odcombian Banquet (1611).

Modern analogues
British travel writer and humourist Tim Moore retraced the steps of Coryat's tour of Europe, as recounted in his book Continental Drifter.

They typically configure a number of behaviors such as for the method to be used during source routing, some control and probing facilities and a number of experimental features.

Loose source routing
Loose Source Routing is an IP option which can be used for address translation. LSR is also used to implement mobility in IP networks.  

Loose source routing uses a source routing option in IP to record the set of routers a packet must visit. The destination of the packet is replaced with the next router the packet must visit. By setting the forwarding agent (FA) to one of the routers that the packet must visit, LSR is equivalent to tunneling. If the corresponding node stores the LSR options and reverses it, it is equivalent to the functionality in mobile IPv6.

The name loose source routing comes from the fact that only part of the path is set in advance.

Strict source routing

Strict source routing is in contrast with loose source routing, in which every step of the route is decided in advance where the packet is sent.

Restrictions and considerations
The following two options are discouraged because they create security concerns: Loose Source and Record Route (LSRR) and Strict Source and Record Route (SSRR). Many routers block packets containing these options.

The film features a conversation between Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, producer of THX 1138. They discuss Lucas' vision for the film, including his ideas about science fiction in general and in particular his concept of the ""used future"" which would famously feature in his film Star Wars. Intercut with this discussion is footage shot prior to the start of production of THX 1138 showing several of its actors having their heads shaved, a requirement for appearing in the film. In several cases the actors are shown being shaved in a public location. For example, Maggie McOmie is shaved outside the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, while Robert Duvall watches a sporting event as his hair is cut off. Another actor, Marshall Efron, who would later play an insane man in the film, cut off his own hair and was filmed doing so in a bathtub.

The film is included as a bonus feature on the 2004 DVD release of The George Lucas Director's Cut of THX 1138 and later the Blu-ray release.

342,12903300,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ%20on%20TV,TMZ on TV,"TMZ on TV (also known as TMZ on Fox and simply as TMZ or TMZTV) is an American syndicated entertainment and gossip news television show that premiered on September 10, 2007 (its major carriage is among television stations owned by Fox's). It is essentially a televised version of its sister operation, TMZ, a news website which has a heavy emphasis on gossip about celebrities' personal lives, and which debuted in December 2005.

The television program is produced at studio facilities that serve as the headquarters for the parent website; they are located at 13031 West Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. “TMZ” is an insider term standing for ""thirty-mile zone"" (also known as the studio zone), which refers  to the film studio area of downtown Hollywood.

In November 2019, Fox Television Stations renewed its commitment to TMZ on TV through the 2022–23 season.

Format
TMZ on TV is broadcast in two formats: the weekday edition is broadcast as a half-hour program; a one-hour weekend edition, composed of select stories featured in each of the weekday editions from the previous week, is also produced; during major holidays occurring on a weekday, that episode may feature a format similar to the weekend edition but featuring a compilation of stories from past editions centered around a particular theme (for example, a Christmas episode may center on celebrities who have been bad or good in the past year).

Unlike most entertainment news programs, TMZ on TV does not use a format of anchors in a studio delivering the stories and correspondents reporting on many of the stories in each edition; instead, most story packages are delivered via an announcer, and ""in-studio"" segments are taped during a morning staff pitch meeting at TMZ's Jefferson Boulevard headquarters, with some TMZ staffers delivering story pieces themselves.

The series delivers most of its stories in a humorous manner, mainly about certain celebrities, and features tongue-in-cheek jokes and double entendres, though more serious entertainment stories (such as a breaking entertainment story or celebrity death) – which appear on the program sparingly – often warrant a serious tone. Pieces often feature archived clips from television series and movies often for comedic effect, though they may sometimes be used to reference a project that an entertainer is known for performing in. Many pieces are shown in the ""man on the street""-type question and answer format synonymous with paparazzi, though some celebrities do not answer certain questions asked to them by the videographer; a common recurring reference within the program is how certain TMZ videographers sometimes ask extremely trivial or bad questions to their subject.

In lieu of regular daily segments such as a rumor mill segment, the program often shows recurring segments that appear over several episodes that feature a humorous or satirical introduction (for example, after the Tiger Woods adultery scandal broke in November 2009, all stories involving Woods began with the introduction: ""TNN: The Tiger News Network"", using a logo and name parodying that of cable news channel (CNN), a sister company to TMZ.com and the distributors of the television series, Warner Bros. Television and Telepictures, all owned by Time Warner). For the first few weeks of the show's run, the series carried a daily segment called ""Full Frontal Fashion"", featuring celebrity fashion blunders, but it was dropped after roughly one month.

Criticism
TMZ was criticized for purchasing stolen items pertaining to the fourth Indiana Jones film. On October 2, 2007, IESB reported that a number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the production budget had been stolen from Steven Spielberg's production office.

According to IESB, TMZ.com obtained some of the stolen property and was on the verge of running the story on the TV show until Paramount lawyers stepped in. After IESB broke the story, TMZ on TV broadcast details about the Indiana Jones production budget on the October 3, 2007, program.

Parodies
 On August 26, 2009, 3rd Degree Films released a pornographic parody film based on TMZ called TM Sleaze, featuring Ron Jeremy, Lisa Ann, Tori Black, and Faye Reagan.
 Originating in 2009 on the short-lived NBC primetime talk show The Jay Leno Show and used from 2010 to 2014 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, comedian Mikey Day performs a sketch called ""JMZ""; in it, Day and his ""camera crew"" track down celebrities (some actual celebrities appear in the sketch, while impersonators whose faces are not shown are shown sometimes in the sketch), which end up with Day involved in strange situations.
 ""Weird Al"" Yankovic wrote a song in 2011, ""TMZ"", about the website and TV show on his album Alpocalypse.
 A 2016 episode of Inside Amy Schumer titled ""Madame President"" opens with a parody of TMZ called ""AMZ"".
A Progressive Insurance commercial did a parody of the show called ""Look! Famous People!"" in which the photographers all take pictures of spokeswoman Flo doing her grocery shopping, then catch her in a car with a man whom they assume to be her new boyfriend; he is instead a potential customer.

International broadcast history
In Canada, TMZ is shown on E!. In Australia it was broadcast on cable/satellite channel Arena until October 2008. It began broadcasting on the digital-only free-to-air channel GO! on August 9, 2009. The show was taken off the air in September 2015 to make way for expansions for children's content.

In the Philippines, Jack TV aired the show until the network's closure in April 2020.

Several years later, he became ""custos-adjunct"" at the ""Imperial Hofmineralien Cabinet"" in Vienna. In 1867 he was named first curator of the mineral cabinet, and in 1874 was appointed professor and director of the mineralogical museum at the University of Vienna.

Known for his investigations in the field of crystallography, he was a proponent of the crystallographic index developed by William Hallowes Miller. In the mid-1860s, he published his best works, ""Atlas der Krystallformen des Mineralreiches"" and an award-winning textbook titled ""Lehrbuch der physikalischen Mineralogie"". In Vienna, he collaborated with Gustav Tschermak in publication of the journal ""Mineralogische Mitteilungen"". A rare mineral known as albrechtschraufite is named in his honor.

In 1896 Schrauf lost sight in his left eye due to sudden exposure of sunlight in the course of performing crystallographic measurements.

348,69740,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSR%2C%20Inc.,"TSR, Inc.","TSR, Inc. was an American game publishing company, best known as the original publisher of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).

When Gary Gygax could not find a publisher for D&D, a new type of game he and Dave Arneson were co-developing, Gygax and Don Kaye founded Tactical Studies Rules in October 1973 to self-publish their products. However, needing immediate financing to bring their new game to market before several similar competing products were released, Gygax and Kaye brought in Brian Blume in December as an equal partner. When Kaye died suddenly in 1975, the Tactical Studies Rules partnership restructured into TSR Hobbies, Inc. and accepted investment from Blume's father Melvin. With the now popular D&D as its main product, TSR Hobbies became a major force in the games industry by the late 1970s.  Melvin Blume eventually transferred his shares to his other son Kevin, making the two Blume brothers the largest shareholders in TSR Hobbies.

TSR Hobbies ran into financial difficulties in the spring of 1983, prompting the company to split into four independent businesses, with game publishing and development continuing as TSR, Inc. (TSR). After losing their executive positions due to the company's underperformance, the Blume brothers subsequently sold their shares to TSR Vice President Lorraine Williams, who in turn engineered Gygax's ouster from the company in October 1985. TSR saw prosperity under Williams, but by 1995, had fallen behind their competitors in overall sales. TSR was left unable to cover its publishing costs due to a variety of factors, so facing insolvency, TSR was purchased in 1997 by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). WotC initially retained use of the TSR name for their D&D products, but by 2000, the TSR moniker was dropped, coinciding with the release of the 3rd edition of D&D.

WotC allowed the TSR trademark to expire in the early 2000s. Two new companies have since utilized the TSR trademark commercially.

History

Tactical Studies Rules

Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) was formed in 1973 as a partnership between Gary Gygax and Don Kaye, who collected together $2,400 for startup costs, to formally publish and sell the rules of Dungeons & Dragons, the creation of Gygax and Dave Arneson and the first modern role-playing game (RPG). The first TSR release, however, was Cavaliers and Roundheads, a miniature game, to start generating income for TSR. The partnership was subsequently joined by Brian Blume and (temporarily) by Arneson. Blume was admitted to the partnership to fund further publishing of D&D instead of waiting for Cavaliers and Roundheads to bring in enough revenue. In the original configuration of the partnership, Kaye served as president, Blume as vice-president, and Gygax as editor.

In January 1974, TSR—with Gygax's basement as a headquarters—produced 1,000 copies of D&D, selling them for $10 each (and the extra dice needed for another $3.50). This first print sold out in 10 months. In January 1975, TSR printed a second 1,000 copies of D&D, which took only another five or six months to sell out. Also in 1974, TSR published Warriors of Mars, a miniatures rules book set in the fantasy world of Barsoom, originally imagined by Edgar Rice Burroughs in his series of novels about John Carter of Mars, to which Gygax paid homage in the preface of the first edition of D&D. However, Gygax and TSR published the Mars book without permission from (or payment to) the Burroughs estate, and soon after, a cease and desist order was issued, and Warriors was pulled from distribution. In 1975, TSR published Blume's Panzer Warfare, a World War II-based miniature wargaming set of rules for use with 1:285 scale micro armour.

At its inception, TSR sold its products directly to customers, shipped to game shops and hobby stores, and wholesaled only to three distributors that were manufacturers of miniature figurines. In 1975, TSR picked up one or two regular distributors. The next year, TSR joined the Hobby Industry Association of America and began exhibiting at their annual trade show, and began to establish a regular network of distributors.

When Don Kaye died of a heart attack on January 31, 1975, his role was taken over by his wife Donna Kaye, who remained responsible for accounting, shipping, and the records of the partnership through the summer. By the summer of 1975, those duties became complex enough that Gygax himself became a full-time employee of the partnership in order to take them over from Donna Kaye. Arneson also entered the partnership in order to coordinate research and design with his circle in the Twin Cities.

TSR Hobbies, Inc.

Blume and Gygax, the remaining owners, incorporated a new company called TSR Hobbies, Inc., with Blume and his father, Melvin Blume, owning the larger share. From the start, Gygax served as president of TSR Hobbies, and Blume as vice president and secretary. Originally, TSR Hobbies was created as a separate company to market miniatures and games from several companies, an enterprise which was also connected to the opening of the Dungeon hobby shop in Lake Geneva. The Dungeon would become the effective headquarters of the company, including the offices of Blume and Gygax. On September 26, 1975, the former assets of the partnership were transferred to TSR Hobbies, Inc. TSR Hobbies subcontracted the printing and assembly work in October 1975, and the third printing of 2,000 copies of D&D sold out in five months. Tim Kask was hired in the autumn of 1975 as Periodicals Editor, and the company's first full-time employee.

Empire of the Petal Throne became the first game product published by TSR Hobbies, followed by two supplements to D&D, Greyhawk and Blackmoor. Also released in 1975 were the board game Dungeon! and the Wild West RPG Boot Hill. The company took $300,000 in revenues for the fiscal year of 1976. TSR began hosting the Gen Con Game Fair in 1976, and featured the first ever D&D open tournament that year. D&D supplements Eldritch Wizardry and Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes were released in 1976, and the original D&D Basic Set was released in 1977. Also in 1977, TSR Hobbies published the original Monster Manual, the first hardbound book ever published by a game company, and the first product in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) line. The next year, the Player's Handbook was published, followed by a series of six adventure modules that had previously only been used in tournaments. Also in 1978, TSR Hobbies moved out of Gygax's home and into downtown Lake Geneva, above the Dungeon Hobby Shop. In 1979, the Dungeon Master's Guide was published, and radio ads featuring ""Morley the Wizard"" were broadcast.

During this era, there were a number of competitors and unofficial supplements to D&D published, arguably in violation of TSR's copyright, which many D&D players used alongside the TSR books. Among these were the Arduin Grimoire, the Manual of Aurenia, and variants such as Warlock and Tunnels & Trolls. TSR regarded these very warily, and in cases where they felt their trademarks were being misused, they issued cease-and-desist letters. More often than not, this legal posturing resulted in only slight changes to competitors' works, but caused significant animosity in the community.

Gygax granted exclusive rights to Games Workshop to distribute TSR products in the United Kingdom, after meeting with Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. Games Workshop printed some original material and also printed their own versions of various D&D and AD&D titles in order to avoid high import costs. When TSR could not reach an agreement with Games Workshop regarding a possible merger, TSR created a subsidiary operation in the UK, TSR Hobbies UK Ltd, in 1980. Gygax hired Don Turnbull to head up the operation, which would expand into continental Europe during the 1980s. TSR UK published a series of modules and the original Fiend Folio. TSR UK also produced Imagine magazine for 31 issues.

The first published campaign setting for AD&D, the World of Greyhawk, was introduced in 1980. The espionage role-playing game Top Secret came out in 1980; reportedly, a note written on TSR stationery about a fictitious assassination plot, part of the playtesting of the new game, brought the FBI to TSR's offices. That same year, the Role Playing Game Association was formed to promote quality roleplaying and unite gamers around the country. In 1981, Inc. magazine listed TSR Hobbies as one of the hundred fastest-growing privately held companies in the US. That same year, TSR Hobbies moved its offices again, this time to a former medical supply building with an attached warehouse. In 1982, TSR Hobbies broke the 20 million mark in sales.

In 1982, TSR Hobbies decided to terminate Grenadier Miniatures's license and started producing its own AD&D miniatures line, followed by a line of toys. Part of the licensing of the AD&D toy line went to LJN. Also that year, TSR introduced two new roleplaying games, Gangbusters and Star Frontiers. Exclusive distribution of the D&D game was established in 22 countries, with the game being translated first into French, followed by many other languages including Danish, Finnish, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, and Swedish. In 1982, an educational department was established to develop curriculum programs for reading, math, history, and problem solving, with the most successful program being the Endless Quest book series.

Melvin Blume's shares were later transferred to Kevin Blume. With the board of directors consisting of Kevin and Brian Blume plus Gygax, Gygax in later interviews described his position as primarily a figurehead president and CEO of the corporation, with Brian Blume as president of creative affairs and Kevin Blume as president of operations, as of 1981. In that year, TSR Hobbies had revenues of $12.9 million and a payroll of 130.

TSR Hobbies sought diversification, acquiring or starting several new business ventures; these include a needle craft business, miniatures manufacturing, toy and gift ventures, and an entertainment division to pursue motion picture and television opportunities. The company also acquired the trademarks and copyrights of SPI and Amazing Stories magazine.

TSR
In 1983, the company was split into four companies: TSR, Inc. (the primary successor), TSR International, TSR Ventures, and TSR Entertainment, Inc.

Gygax left for Hollywood to found TSR Entertainment, Inc., later Dungeons & Dragons Entertainment Corp., which attempted to license D&D products to movie and television executives. His work would eventually lead to only a single license for what later became the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon. However, the series spawned more than 100 different licenses, and led its time slot for two years.

TSR, Inc. released the Dragonlance saga in 1984 after two years of development, making TSR the number one publisher of fantasy and science fiction novels in the USA. Dragonlance consisted of an entirely new game world promoted both by a series of game supplements and a trilogy of novels written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. The Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the first novel in the series, reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller list, encouraging TSR to a launch a long series of paperback novels based on the various official settings for D&D.

In 1984, TSR signed a license to publish the Marvel Super Heroes, Indiana Jones, and Conan role-playing games. In 1985, the Gen Con game fair moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, due to a need for additional space. The Oriental Adventures hardback for AD&D was released that same year, becoming the biggest seller for 1985. TSR introduced the All My Children game, based on the ABC daytime drama, with more than 150,000 copies sold. In 1986, TSR introduced the Dungeon Adventures magazine, a bi-monthly magazine featuring only adventure scenarios for D&D.

Williams ownership
Hearing rumors that the Blumes were trying to sell TSR, Gygax returned from Hollywood and discovered the company was in bad financial shape despite healthy sales. Gygax, who at that time owned only about 30% of the stock, requested that the board of directors remove the Blumes as a way of restoring financial health to the company. The Blumes were forced to leave the company after being accused of misusing corporate funds and accumulating large debts in the pursuit of acquisitions such as latchhook rug kits that were thought to be too broadly targeted. Within a year of the departure of the Blumes, the company was forced to post a net loss of US$1.5 million, resulting in layoffs of approximately 75% of the staff. Some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies, such as Pacesetter Ltd and Mayfair Games, or to work with Coleco's video game division.

However, in an act many saw as retaliation, the Blumes sold their stock to Lorraine Williams. Gygax tried to have the sale declared illegal; after that failed, Gygax sold his remaining stock to Williams and used the capital to form New Infinity Productions.

Williams was a financial planner who saw potential for rebuilding the debt-plagued company into a highly profitable one. However, she was disdainful of the gaming field, viewing herself as superior to gamers.

TSR released the Forgotten Realms campaign setting in 1987. That year, a small team of designers began work on the second edition of the AD&D game. In 1988, TSR released a Bullwinkle & Rocky RPG, complete with a spinner and hand puppets. That same year, TSR released the wargame The Hunt for Red October based on Tom Clancy's novel The Hunt for Red October, which became one of the biggest selling wargames of all time. In 1989, the AD&D 2nd edition was released, with a new Dungeon Master's Guide, Player's Handbook, the first three volumes of the new Monstrous Compendium, The Complete Fighter's Handbook, The Complete Thief's Handbook, and a new campaign setting, Spelljammer, all released in the same year.

Under Williams' direction, TSR solidified its expansion into other fields, such as magazines, paperback fiction, and comic books. Through her family, she personally held the rights to the Buck Rogers license and encouraged TSR to produce Buck Rogers games and novels. TSR would end up publishing a board game and a role-playing game, the latter based on the AD&D 2nd Edition rules.

In 1990, the Ravenloft setting was released, and Count Strahd von Zarovich soon became one of the most popular and enduring villains. The West Coast division of TSR was opened to develop various entertainment projects, including a series of science fiction, horror, and action/adventure comic books. In 1991, TSR released the Dark Sun campaign setting. TSR also released the first of three annual sets of collector cards in 1991. In 1992, TSR released the Al-Qadim setting. TSR's first hardcover novel, The Legacy by R. A. Salvatore, was published that year, and climbed to the top of the New York Times bestseller list within weeks. In 1992, the Gen Con Game Fair broke all previous attendance records for any U.S gaming convention, with more than 18,000 people. In 1993, the DragonStrike Entertainment product was released as a new approach to recruiting new players, including a 30-minute video which explained the concepts of role-playing. 1994 saw the release of the Planescape campaign setting.

In 1994, TSR signed an agreement with Sweetpea Entertainment for D&D movie rights.

By 1995, TSR had fallen behind both Games Workshop and Wizards of the Coast in sales volume. Seeing the profits being generated by Wizards of the Coast with their collectible card game (CCG) Magic: The Gathering, TSR attempted to enter this market in 1995 in a novel way with Dragon Dice. Similar to collectible card games, each player started with a random assortment of basic dice, and could improve their assortment by purchasing booster packs of more powerful dice. In addition to this initiative, TSR also decided to publish twelve hardcover novels in 1996, despite a previous history of publishing only one or two hardcover novels each year.

Sales of Dragon Dice through the games trade started strongly, so TSR quickly produced several expansion packs. In addition, TSR tried to aggressively market Dragon Dice in mass-market book stores through Random House. However, the game did not catch on through the book trade, and sales of the expansion sets through traditional games stores were poor. In addition, the twelve hardcover novels did not sell as well as expected.

The year 1995 also saw TSR's attempt to create an audiobook equivalent to the gamebook format. Similar in premise to the X-files or White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness line, the four Terror T.R.A.X (""Trace, Research, Analyze, and Exterminate"") games cast the player in the role of the head of a secret government agency that protects the world from monsters.  By switching audio tracks, the player could give orders to their agents, and learn the aftermath of their decisions.  Four such games were ultimately released (Track of the Vampire, Track of the Werewolf, Track of the Creature, and Track of the Mummy).

TSR's demise
By 1996, TSR was experiencing numerous problems, as outlined by Shannon Appelcline: ""CCGs were continuing to shrink the RPG industry. Distributors were going out of business. TSR had unbalanced their AD&D game through a series of lucrative supplements that ultimately hurt the long-time viability of the game. Meanwhile, they had developed so many settings – many of them popular and well-received – that they were both cannibalizing their only sales and discouraging players from picking up settings that might be gone in a few years. They may have been cannibalizing their own sales through excessive production of books or supplements too."" David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, adds that Spellfire and Dragon Dice ""were both expensive to produce, and neither sold very well"".

Despite total sales of $40 million, TSR ended 1996 with little in cash reserves. When Random House returned an unexpectedly high percentage of unsold stock, including the year's inventory of unsold novels and sets of Dragon Dice, and charged a fee of several million dollars, TSR found itself in a cash crunch. With no cash, TSR was unable to pay their printing and shipping bills, and the logistics company that handled TSR's pre-press, printing, warehousing, and shipping refused to do any more work. Since the logistics company had the production plates for key products such as core D&D books, there was no means of printing or shipping core products to generate income or secure short-term financing. Despite high sales, the company was deep in debt and not profitable in large part due to returns. Thirty staff members were laid off in December 1996, and other staff left over disagreements about how the crisis was handled, including James M. Ward. In large part due to the need to refund Random House, TSR entered 1997 over $30 million in debt. TSR was threatened by lawsuits due to unpaid freelancers and missing royalties, but TSR made enough money from products already on the shelves to pay remaining staff through the first half of 1997. With no viable financial plan for TSR's survival, Lorraine Williams sold the company to Wizards of the Coast in 1997. Before the corporate offices in Lake Geneva were closed, some TSR employees accepted the offer of transferring to Wizards of the Coast's offices in Washington. Wizards of the Coast continued to use the TSR name for D&D products for three years, until the third edition of D&D was released in 2000 under the Wizards of the Coast brand only. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by Hasbro, Inc. In 2002, Gen Con was sold to Peter Adkison.

Subsequent trademark usage 
A new TSR company was founded by Jayson Elliot, who co-founded the Roll for Initiative podcast. Elliot found that the TSR trademark had expired around 2004 so he registered it in 2011. He then came up with an idea to launch the new company with assistance from early TSR/D&D contributors including Luke and Ernie Gygax, sons of the deceased D&D co-creator Gary Gygax, and Tim Kask, former editor of Dragon magazine. Their first product was Gygax Magazine, announced along with the TSR company revival in December 2012. Wired reported that ""Elliot stressed that his 'TSR is a new company'."" Both Gygax brothers left the company in 2016 when the magazine ended. The company operated as TSR Games, producing the Top Secret: New World Order role-playing game.

In June 2021, a new, separate TSR company was launched by a group including Ernie Gygax, Justin LaNasa and Stephen Dinehart. The company is based out of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; they plan to release tabletop games and operate the Dungeon Hobby Shop Museum, which is located in the first office building of the original TSR. Elliot's TSR Games then announced on social media that while they have owned the trademark since 2011, they missed a filing date in 2020 and were considering various options. However, after Ernie Gygax's ""troubling comments about race, gender identity, and gun violence, as well as his company's reaction"", Elliot announced that his company would not have ""any form of working relationship"" with Ernie Gygax's TSR. Ultimately, Elliot's TSR Games was rebranded as Solarian Games in July 2021. Ernie Gygax's TSR then rebranded as Wonderfilled, Inc. Dicebreaker reported that ""TSR Games never officially announced its rebranding as Wonderfilled Games"" and most of its ""Twitter accounts had been locked down or nuked, and the company's old website simply redirected to a new page that – interestingly – listed Dinehart's GiantLands as an in-development title. [...] How much of TSR Games exists in Wonderfilled Games isn't clear"".

Products
TSR's main products were role-playing games, the most successful of which was D&D. However, they also produced other games such as card, board, and dice games, and published both magazines and books.

Fiction
In 1984, TSR started publishing novels based on their games. Most D&D campaign settings had their own novel line, the most successful of which were the Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms lines, with dozens of novels each.

TSR also published the 1995 novel Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future by Martin Caidin, a standalone re-imagining of the Buck Rogers universe and unrelated to TSR's Buck Rogers XXVC game.

TSR published quite a number of fantasy and science fiction novels unconnected with their gaming products, such as L. Dean James' ""Red Kings of Wynnamyr"" novels, Sorcerer's Stone (1991) and Kingslayer (1992); Mary H. Herbert's five ""Gabria"" novels (Valorian, Dark Horse, Lightning's Daughter, City of the Sorcerers, and Winged Magic); and humorous fantasy fiction, including Roy V. Young's ""Count Yor"" novels Captains Outrageous (1994) and Yor's Revenge(1995). However, such projects never represented more than a fraction of the company's fiction output, which retained a strong emphasis on game-derived works.

Criticism

After its initial success faded, the company turned to legal defenses of what it regarded as its intellectual property. In addition, there were several legal cases brought regarding who had invented what within the company and the division of royalties, including several lawsuits against Gygax. This included the company threatening to sue individuals supplying game material on websites. In the mid-1990s, this led to frequent use of the nickname ""T$R"" in discussions on RPG-related Internet mailing lists and Usenet, as the company was widely perceived as attacking its customers. Increasing product proliferation did not help matters; many of the product lines overlapped and were separated by what seemed like minor points (even the classic troika of Greyhawk, the Forgotten Realms, and Dragonlance suffered in this regard).

The company was the subject of an urban myth stating that it tried to trademark the term ""Nazi"".  This was based on a supplement for the Indiana Jones RPG, in which some figures were marked with ""Nazi™"".  This notation was because of compliance with the list of trademarked character names supplied by Lucasfilm's legal department; all such figures were marked with a trademark symbol, and the Nazi figures were likewise marked accidentally. Later references to the error would forget its origin and slowly morph into the urban myth.

350,21581762,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert%20Van%20de%20Sompel,Herbert Van de Sompel,"Herbert Van de Sompel is a Belgian librarian, computer scientist, and musician, most known for his role in the development of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and standards such as OpenURL, Object Reuse and Exchange, and the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.

Career
Van de Sompel was born March 20, 1957 in Ghent, Belgium. His PhD dissertation in 2000 developed the idea of context-sensitive and dynamic linking of scholarly information resources. In this work, he developed the ""concepts underlying the OpenURL framework for open reference linking in the web-based scholarly information environment."" Van de Sompel's OpenURL framework allowed for the development of software known as link resolvers which take metadata about a source and attempt to find its full text. Link resolver web services have become widely used within academic libraries.  His Ph.D dissertation and later development of the OpenURL standard led to the development and commercialization of the SFX link resolver and a series of products for libraries using this approach pioneered by Van de Sompel.

In 2006 Van de Sompel was named the first recipient of the SPARC Innovator Award by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) for starting the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and the open reference linking framework (OpenURL). In 2017, Van de Sompel received the Paul Evan Peters Award from the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI).

From 2002 to the end of 2018, Van de Sompel held positions at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, including as the Lead of the Digital Library Research and Prototyping Team. Notable work includes the Memento Project, which aims to make accessing archived web content as easy as visiting current web pages.  From 2019 to early 2021, he served as chief innovation officer of Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) in The Netherlands. Following his wife after her appointment to a position in Vienna, he resigned at DANS while keeping professional connections to both DANS and Ghent University.

Though best known for his work as a computer scientist, Van de Sompel also made music in his earlier life, including two albums, ""Unploughed"" and ""Not a Festschrift- Geschnitzte Figuren,"" with his group, Young Farmers Claim Future.

352,1967919,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaak,Salaak,"Salaak is a fictional comic book superhero, an extraterrestrial from the planet Slyggia, and a member of the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps, who appears in DC Comics. Physically, he has pinkish orange skin and four arms.

Publication history
Salaak first appears in Green Lantern #149 and was created by Marv Wolfman and Joe Staton.

Fictional character biography
A famous pessimist and loner, Salaak is a creature of protocol and laws. A veteran Green Lantern, he has served in many Corps campaigns over the years. During the Crisis on Infinite Earths he protects multiple sectors, but found the experience depressing. After this, he went to Earth looking for company amongst his fellow Green Lanterns. He served with the contingent of Green Lanterns assigned to Earth and became good friends with Ch'p of H'lven. For a time Salaak lived in the future, filling the identity of Pol Manning as Hal Jordan had before him. While in the future, Salaak was married to a human woman.

Salaak returns to the present day to warn about the destruction of the Corps. He was too late to stop the execution of Sinestro. The Central Power Battery on Oa ends up destroyed, and with it, Salaak's ring is made inoperable. He finds transport to H'lven where he reunites with Ch'p, one of the few Lanterns whose ring still functioned. Salaak remains on H'lven and acts as Ch'p's advisor until they discover that the Guardians have returned and have rebuilt the Corps. The two later petition for reinstatement, but Ch'p is killed in a traffic accident. The Corps is destroyed again when Hal Jordan, crazed with grief at the loss of friends, became the entity known as Parallax. Hal's activities caused the shutdown of the Oan battery again and Salaak, along with all other Green Lanterns, were left powerless.

Salaak ends up captured, along with multiple other Green Lanterns and one Darkstar. They are scheduled to be sold into slavery but former Green Lantern Guy Gardner, with powers underived from a Power Ring, rescues the entire group.

Promotion
Salaak attends Hal's memorial service on Earth. The Corps, reformed again, has Salaak as the senior administrator and the Keeper of the Book of Oa. The Book tells of the adventures of multiple Green Lanterns throughout the history of the universe.

Salaak reinforces the squadron of Lanterns sent to save Mogo from Ranx the Sentient City and other Sinestro Corps members (Sinestro having returned from the dead). He has expressed displeasure at the fact that the Guardians have rewritten the Book of Oa to allow lethal force against members of the Sinestro Corps, but is still committed to serve.

He survived the Sinestro Corps War without major injuries, and he continues to hold on to his position as keeper of the Book of Oa. He is kept out of the loop in some instances by the Guardians who neglected to tell him their plans to create the Alpha Lanterns. He is seen getting into an argument with Guy Gardner over a bar he wishes to open. Salaak quickly disapproves, which leads Guy to use his ring to make a miniaturized version of Salaak mocking him for ""hanging out with midgets"".

Salaak is seen in Final Crisis #5 as part of the trial of Hal Jordan.

During the Blackest Night, Oa comes under siege from the Black Lantern Corps. With the Guardians missing, Salaak takes command of the Green Lantern Corps as Clarissi and thus the next in succession after the Guardians, preventing the Alpha Lanterns' attempt to take control. As his first command decision, Salaak decrees that all fallen Lantern rings be sent to Mogo, so as not to endanger any new recruits.

After the War of the Green Lanterns, Salaak went along with the Guardians' orders to prepare a space for Krona in the Green Lantern memorial hall despite the other Corps members' anger at such a decision, despite Salaak claiming that the Guardians want to remember the good that Krona did in helping to found the Corps rather than the evil he committed later, with the other Corps members denouncing him for his blind loyalty.

When Kyle Rayner is briefly turned into a ring magnet, Salaak attempts to remove Kyle's Green Lantern ring on the Guardians' orders. Kyle's ring resists Salaak's attempt at removal as Kyle protests the decision and what they did to Ganthet. Later, Salaak assigns the Green Lantern B'dg to find Hal Jordan on Earth and discovers that the green rings are being delayed under the authorization of the Guardians to which he also secretly informs Kilowog of these events. Concerned at recent events, Salaak begins to spy on the Guardians, learning of their plans for the Third Army. He is subsequently caught and locked away despite his protests that their plans are wrong. After the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, Salaak is freed from his imprisonment by Kilowog and Guy Gardner, who explain to him the events regarding the villainous First Lantern. Later, Salaak helps Guy search for his old arch-enemy, Xar. Guy slays Xar on Earth.

As with most Lanterns, Salaak is lost in the dying universe proceeding this one. He is fortunate to be one of the few Lanterns on the thriving, living Lantern world Mogo, which has become a center of activity in what is left of said universe.

The Corps have returned, damaged and with many casualties, to their proper place and time. Salaak has returned to active duty, such as assisting against the brainwashing menace Starro.

Characteristics
The members of this family are found in muddy sand or gravel at or below low tide mark. They have characteristically rounded shells with forward-facing umbones (projections). The valves are flattened and deeply etched with concentric rings. Each valve bears two cardinal and two plate-like lateral teeth. These molluscs do not have siphons but the extremely long foot makes a channel which is then lined with slime and serves for the intake and expulsion of water.

358,967174,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Guardian%20%281990%20film%29,The Guardian (1990 film),"The Guardian is a 1990 American supernatural horror film co-written and directed by William Friedkin, and starring Jenny Seagrove as a mysterious nanny who is hired by new parents, played by Dwier Brown and Carey Lowell, to care for their infant son; the couple soon discover the nanny to be a Hamadryad, whose previous clients' children went missing under her care. The film is based on the novel The Nanny, by Dan Greenburg.

Director Sam Raimi was originally attached to the project, before dropping out to direct Darkman. Heavily marketed as director Friedkin's first foray into the horror genre since 1973's The Exorcist, the film had a troubled production, with the script undergoing changes that continued well into the shooting process.

The film was released in the spring of 1990, and had a generally unfavorable critical reception, later making Roger Ebert's ""most hated films"" list. A cable television version of the film was credited to ""Alan Von Smithee"", due to Friedkin's wish to disassociate himself from its release. Although a critical and commercial failure, the film later found an audience as a cult film.

Plot
Molly and Allan Sheridan leave their two children in the care of a new nanny, Diana Julian. Diana, who is in fact an ancient Hamadryad, kidnaps their infant daughter, taking her to a forest where she approaches a giant, gnarled tree, serving the child as a human sacrifice to sustain the tree's life. Diana's reflection as she stares into a pool of water transforms to that of a growling wolf.

Three months later, Phil and Kate Sterling have recently relocated from Chicago to Los Angeles, where Phil has taken a lucrative advertising job. Kate becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son, Jake. The couple decide to hire a nanny to allow each of them to maintain their jobs, and interview two clients through a nanny agency: a young woman named Arlene, and a caring English woman, Camilla. When Arlene dies in a bicycling accident, Camilla is swiftly hired and becomes an invaluable member of the Sterlings' household.

One afternoon while Camilla rests in a meadow with Jake, she is approached by three aggressive bikers who attempt to sexually assault her. She flees to the base of the gnarled tree, which subsequently comes to life, its branches strangling and eviscerating the men. Wolves consume one of their entrails, and another is impaled by the tree's root and then bursts into flame. During a dinner party some days later, Ned, the Sterlings' neighbor who designed their home, invites Camilla on a date, which she declines. That night, Phil has a nightmare in which he has sex with Camilla. The next day, moments after Camilla leaves to go shopping, Ned stops by the house with a bouquet of flowers for her. Kate explains she just left on foot, and Ned drives after her, catching sight of her fleeing into the forest. Ned pursues her, eventually coming across her bathing in the creek. He watches as Camilla approaches the large tree, and begins to fuse with the tree bark. A pack of wolves pursue Ned, who flees back to his house. He leaves a rambling phone message for Phil and Kate. Moments later, Camilla appears, naked and ashen, on the hearth, before the wolves break into the home, eating him alive. Camilla drags his remains away.

When checking the answering machine the following morning, Phil finds two messages: One from a stranger, Molly Sheridan, who says it is urgent she speak with him. The next is Ned's, which is incoherent, but Camilla interrupts him from finishing listening to it. Phil meets with Molly the next day. She describes the disappearance of her infant daughter, as well as the nanny Diana, whom she came to discover was a false identity. She requests that Phil arrange for her to see Camilla, suspecting they are the same person. When Phil returns home, he listens to Ned's message in full, which warns him against letting Camilla back in the house. Discovering Ned is missing, Phil confronts Camilla in front of Kate, but Jake grows violently ill during the confrontation and has to be rushed to the hospital, exhibiting coma-like symptoms.

Jake regains consciousness in the hospital, and Camilla attempts to kidnap him, but Phil intercepts, throwing Camilla to the ground. Phil and Kate depart with Jake, and upon arriving home are confronted by a pack of wolves. Kate flees to the couple's Jeep, while Phil runs toward the woods with Jake, as Camilla pursues them both, levitating through the forest, until they reach the large tree. Kate chases after them in the Jeep, eventually hitting and killing Camilla. As Phil examines Camilla's body, he notices faces of babies embossed in the tree bark.

Later, a detective tells the couple no evidence of Camilla's existence can be found. Phil decides to cut down the tree with a chainsaw, but in his absence, Kate is attacked by Camilla—now part-tree, part-human—who has again infiltrated the house. As Phil attempts to cut the tree, the branches entangle him and begin to bleed as he inflicts damage on them. The damage concurrently impacts Camilla, who is fighting Kate. When Phil saws off a large branch, Camilla's leg severs from her body, allowing Kate to push her out a window. Simultaneously, Phil manages to fell the tree, but it combusts before landing, as Camilla's body similarly disintegrates before hitting the ground. A bloodied Phil drops the chainsaw and returns home as Kate picks up Jake. Seeing the mess in the house, Phil realizes what happened as he is reunited with his wife and son now knowing with Camilla finally died, his family is now safe.

Cast

Production

Filming
The Guardian was shot on location in Los Angeles and Santa Clarita, California. The forest location featured in the film was shot at a nature preserve in Valencia, California, near Six Flags Magic Mountain.

Script changes
The original script for The Guardian bore a closer resemblance to its source material, The Nanny by novelist Dan Greenburg, which told the story of a nanny who steals children. According to screenwriter Stephen Volk, Sam Raimi was originally attached to the picture. Raimi had dropped out of the production to direct Darkman, at which point William Friedkin was brought in to direct. The script, which had originally been conceived as a tongue-in-cheek thriller for Raimi, eventually ""metamorphosed into something different"" during the course of filming, as Friedkin made numerous changes. Volk attempted to rework the script for Friedkin, initially re-writing the character of the nanny as a real-life Lilith, the child-stealing demon from Jewish mythology. Friedkin dismissed the idea, and Volk then reworked the script into a straightforward psychological thriller about an unhinged woman stealing children; however, Universal Pictures objected to the reworking, stating that they wanted a ""supernatural"" horror film given Friedkin's reputation for The Exorcist (1973). Amidst the shifting script, Friedkin began auditioning for the role of Camilla. Uma Thurman was originally a candidate for the role prior to the script changes. After Volk suggested using elements from the M.R. James story ""The Ash-tree"" in the script, Friedkin became fixated on incorporating a tree into Camilla's backstory. Volk reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown and left the production, leaving Friedkin to finish the script's loose ends after filming had already begun.

In a 2015 interview, Jenny Seagrove recalled visiting Friedkin at his home in Los Angeles, where he told her he had been reading about Druid mythology and wanted to incorporate it into the film. According to Seagrove: ""Pages were flying at us [...] and then suddenly this idea of this weird kind of tree came about, and suddenly my character was not just a nanny but she was a Druid character who turned into a part of the tree, and she had to feed the tree—things were evolving all the time.""

Special effects
Seagrove underwent numerous extensive makeup transformations in the film, at times covered in tree bark during the metamorphosing scenes. The tree featured in the film was constructed by the special effects department in Burbank, California, and transported to the nature preserve in Valencia. The tree contained tubes of circulating fake blood in order for the tree to properly ""bleed"" when cut.

Alternate endings
The television version of the film ends with Phil and Kate returning home from the hospital with Jake, while Camilla is alive and naked at the tree. Director William Friedkin disapproved of the television cut of the film, and removed his name from the credits, naming ""Alan von Smithee"" as the director.

The video and DVD versions have the full ending, in which Camilla appears in her true form and tries to take the baby from Kate, but Phil cuts down the tree with a chainsaw, thus killing both it and Camilla.

Release
The Guardian was released in North American cinemas on April 27, 1990, opening at #3 at the box office, on 1,684 screens, with a USD$5,565,620 weekend. The film went on to gross a total of $17,037,887 domestically.

Critical response
The Guardian earned mostly negative reviews from critics, and holds a 30% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 10 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one star out of four, and later named it as one of his ""Most Hated Films"". Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a middling review, saying ""[Friedkin] never sustains the story's tension for very long, and even cuts off the scarier episodes before they have a chance to sink in. What's more, he never offers a consistent idea of what sort of evil is at work here.""

The Washington Post also gave the film a negative review, stating: ""the plot is so preposterous that The Guardian never comes close to grabbing attention, empathy or sympathy."" David Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote: ""Like The Exorcist, The Guardian is a horror story set in the bosom of the nuclear family, and it, too, tries to exploit a culturewide fear, turning a shared guilt into monstrous projection. The guilt of The Guardian, however, is far more mundane and far less gripping than The Exorcists agony over our abandonment of the church."" Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote that the film was ""pretty good claptrap,"" but noted that ""as it makes its way to a bloody payoff, it loses immediacy and individuality, subsiding into bloody cliche.""

Time Out said in their review of the film: ""Friedkin opts for up-front hokum, interspersed with impressively ridiculous special effects, including man-eating trees, flying nannies and coniferous chainsaw carnage. A severely flawed but not unamusing venture from a director who should know better.""

Actress Jenny Seagrove said of the film in retrospect, ""I don't want to put off anyone from watching it because it is good fun,"" but noted that, during the first screening, ""there was a feeling in the room that it wasn't the sort of picture everyone had hoped it was going to be."" She also said: ""It has become a cult film, but the screenplay was appalling. It was being written on the hoof.""

To the question ""Which films were the farthest?"" on his career, William Friedkin cited The Guardian and simply said about it: ""The Guardian I don’t think works""

Home media
The Guardian was released on VHS by MCA Universal home video in October 1990. It was later licensed by Universal for a DVD release through Anchor Bay Entertainment, released it on October 12, 1999. The DVD features an audio commentary by director Friedkin, as well as the original theatrical trailer. This release has been long out of print and is difficult to obtain, although a UK DVD by Second Sight, also featuring Friedkin's commentary, has subsequently become widely available.

The film was released on Blu-ray for the first time by Shout Factory on January 19, 2016. A UK Blu-ray by Final Cut Entertainment is due for release in October, 2018.

359,2912664,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitable%20water,Precipitable water,"Precipitable water  is the depth of water in a column of the atmosphere, if all the water in that column were precipitated as rain. As a depth, the precipitable water is measured in millimeters or inches.  Often abbreviated as ""TPW"", for Total Precipitable Water.

Measurement 
There are different measurement techniques: 
One type of measurement is based on the measurement of the solar irradiance on two wavelengths, one in a water absorption band, and the other not. The precipitable water column is determined using the irradiances in these bands and the Beer–Lambert law.
The precipitable water can also be calculated by integration of radiosonde data (relative humidity, pressure and temperature) over the whole atmosphere.
Data can be viewed on a Lifted-K index. The numbers represent inches of water as mentioned above for a geographical location.
Recently, methods using the Global Positioning System have been developed.
Some work has been performed to create empirical relationships between surface specific humidity and precipitable water based on localized measurements (generally a 2nd to 5th order polynomial).  However, this method has not received widespread use in part because humidity is a local measurement and precipitable water is a total column measurement.

362,4014637,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Lake%20Poyang,Battle of Lake Poyang,"The battle of Lake Poyang () was a naval conflict which took place 30 August – 4 October 1363 between the rebel forces of Zhu Yuanzhang and Chen Youliang during the Red Turban Rebellion which led to the fall of the Yuan dynasty. Chen Youliang besieged Nanchang with a large fleet on Lake Poyang, one of China's largest freshwater lakes, and Zhu Yuanzhang met his force with a smaller fleet. After an inconclusive engagement exchanging fire, Zhu employed fire ships to burn the enemy tower ships and destroyed their fleet. This was the last major battle of the rebellion prior to the rise of the Ming dynasty.

Background 
On 30 August 1363, the forces of Chen Han conducted a major amphibious assault on Nanchang but failed to take it due to the defenders' use of cannons and suffered great losses. The town of Nanchang was strategically located to guard Lake Poyang, which connected the Yangzi with other river basins. During the early 1360s Zhu Yuanzhang held key garrisons on the lake and administered them from Nanjing 560 kilometers downriver. In 1362, Chen Youliang tried to deposit his troops on the city walls with ""tower ships"". This proved futile as the city defenders simply moved the walls back and Chen was forced to personally lead an assault on the city gates. They were repelled with a barrage of cannonfire and driven back. After this failure, Chen set up a blockade, determined to starve out the defenders, but a small fishing boat managed to slip out and reached Nanjing in time to warn Zhu Yuanzhang.

The battle 

Zhu Yuanzhang's fleet arrived at Hukou on 24 August and relieved Nanchang on the 28th. Chen Youliang embarked his forces and sailed north into Lake Poyang. The two fleets met on 29 August. Zhu's forces numbered only a third the size of Chen's army. According to one Ming source, Zhu's forces arrived armed with ""fire bombs, fire guns, fire arrows, fire seeds [probably grenades], large and small fire lances, large and small 'commander' fire-tubes, large and small iron bombs, rockets."" This shows that older gunpowder weapons co-existed alongside guns, and proto-guns such as fire lances were not supplanted until after early Ming. A new weapon called the ""No Alternative"" was also mentioned. The No Alternative was ""made from a circular reed mat about five inches around and seven feet long that was pasted over with red paper and bound together with silk and hemp— stuffed inside it was gunpowder twisted in with bullets and all kinds of [subsidiary] gunpowder weapons."" It was hung from a pole on the foremast, and when an enemy ship came into close range, the fuse was lit, and the weapon would supposedly fall onto the enemy ship, at which point things inside shot out ""and burned everything to bits, with no hope of salvation."" 

On 30 August, Zhu deployed his fleet in 11 squadrons with orders to ""get close to the enemy's ships and first set off gunpowder weapons (發火器), then bows and crossbows, and finally attack their ships with short range weapons."" Fire bombs were hurled using naval trebuchets and Zhu's forces succeeded in ""burning twenty or more enemy vessels and killing or drowning many enemy troops,"" but their own flagship also caught fire and hit a sandbar. Chen's warships drove back the opposing line until they fell back to a shallow area where they could not be pursued. Zhu tried again to engage with Chen's fleet in ship to ship combat and was driven back once more with severe losses. The next day, the wind shifted towards Chen's forces and Zhu sent fire ships into them, destroying several hundred vessels. While guns were used during the battle, ultimately they were not pivotal to success, and the battle was won using incendiary weapons.

On 2 September, the two fleets engaged in battle again. Though still outnumbered, Zhu's forces were able to isolate and destroy larger enemy warships, forcing them to withdraw. Afterwards, Zhu's fleet settled into a blockade for another month before Chen decided to make a break for it on 4 October. Zhu was ready with fire ships set adrift, scattering Chen's ships so that clusters of ships engaged in combat far from each other. Chen Youliang was killed when an arrow struck his head.

Aftermath 
Chen Youliang was succeeded by his son, Chen Li, who surrendered to Zhu in 1364.

The Ming victory here cemented their position as the leading rebel group. Five years later, the Ming would overthrow the Yuan and take command over China. Zhu Yuanzhang then became the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty as Hongwu.

The first Volume (1986) was distributed as a plain 1st Word .DOC file, after that a custom shell was produced that enabled the 1st Word documents to be displayed in a userfriendly disk magazine shell.

1st Word first began being bundled with the Atari ST in December 1985. 1st Word Plus version 2.0 credits Mike Bees, Howard Chalkley, Phil Champ, Martin Dickens, Chris Scheybeler, and Alun  Gladman.

Acorn Computers commissioned GST to make a version known as First Word Plus available for the Archimedes range of computers, this becoming available for the Arthur operating system in 1988, priced at £92. After the release of RISC OS, a new version of the software was released to take advantage of the multi-tasking environment, although the application did not make use of the system's own printing architecture and accompanying drivers, instead retaining its own drivers to take advantage of printer features such as ""near-letter quality"" modes. Also priced at £92, with an upgrade from the earlier version costing £45, the software was regarded as not providing any ""giant leap forward in capability"" from similar products on Acorn's 8-bit computers, but nevertheless made the activities of such a ""simple system"" easier to accomplish on the more capable hardware, lending itself to efficient use of dot-matrix or daisywheel printers. It was also considered a useful companion to Acorn Desktop Publisher - a derivative of GST's Timeworks software - making a ""neat system"" for users with 2 MB of RAM.

A PC version was produced that ran using Digital Research's GEM interface. Other versions were produced for the Torch XXX and for Digital Research's FlexOS.

365,47252513,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demirk%C3%B6y%20Foundry,Demirköy Foundry,"The Demirköy Foundry () is a historic foundry ruin of archaeological importance located at Demirköy in Kırklareli Province, northwestern Turkey.

Location
The archaeological site is situated  southeast of the district seat Demirköy. An iron metalworking center was established at this location in the 15th century during the Ottoman Empire due to the rich iron ore deposits in the region. The site is deep in the Strandzha forests, about  far from the Black Sea coast and  to the Bulgarian-Turkish border.

History
It is known that the cannonballs fired during the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II (Fatih Sultan Mehmet, Mehmed the Conqueror) were manufactured here. The facility is also called today by the local people as Fatih Foundry (the ""Conqueror's Foundry""). Demirköy means literally ""Ironville"". Iron casting continued in the foundry from the mid-15th century until the late 19th century. It appears that the foundry underwent a thoroughgoing renovation during the Mahmud II (1808–1839) period. The foundry was then subordinated to the administration of Imperial Cannon Factory (Tophane-i Amire) in Istanbul, which was established in 1839. According to the Ottoman documents, its historic name was ""Samakocuk Dökümhane-i Amiresi"" (literally: Samakocuk İmperial Foundry).

According to a 1923-published report of the government doctor in Kırklareli, the foundry was destroyed by the invading Russian troops during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78). In 1913, the state-owned foundry was leased to a British company for a period of 99 years, but in 1916 the lease was annulled due to the circumstances of World War I. After World War I, the foundry was abandoned; its structure, however, remained intact until the 1950s. The metal parts of the foundry were sold to scrappers by the National Estate Authority () in 1947.

Archaeological findings
The Kırklareli Museum identified and registered the remains of the Ottoman foundry as an archaeological conservation area in September 1991. In May 2002, a research project was initiated on the iron mining and metalworking in the area. Archival investigations, surface surveys and archaeological excavations at the partly preserved site, which covers a total area of , began in the summer of 2003.

Important finds of industrial archaeology, unearthed in 2005 at a site  far from the original site, revealed the existence of another metalworking workshop with two melting furnaces. The workshop was  in dimension and consisted of two sections with a central entrance. While the eastern wing furnace was identified as a blast furnace for iron production showing advanced technology of the 17th century, the west-wing furnace was used for copper smelting. According to 19th-century Ottoman documents, copper production was the second major activity following iron metalworking in the foundries of Demirköy-Samakocuk. Copper was used for copper alloy to make molds for casting cannonballs.
 
The units of the main foundry complex, which was built in a square-plan on a hillside, are situated on two ground levels of  difference in elevation. The upper section was fortified by -thick and -high surrounding stone walls with polygon-formed bastions on the corners. The main gate in the north opened to the courtyard at this upper terrace, which contains living and service spaces, a partly-preserved Ottoman hammam and a mosque. The quarters of the foundry workers for living and sleeping were placed along the walls in the north, west and east. In the southwest of the courtyard, the basement walls of the foundry mosque is situated with a brick minaret erected on stone base next to it.

Foundry's production units were on the lower-level terrace south of the fortified courtyard. During the excavations in 2008, an iron workshop with two melting furnaces was unearthed southeast of the courtyard. While the archaeological excavations in the upper ground level are completed, research in the lower ground level is ongoing.

In order to achieve high temperature needed in the melting fırnaces, bellows were utilized, which were worked up by a water wheel. It is believed that the power was transmitted from the water wheel to the bellows by a horizontal shaft. An open-deck canal northeast of the foundry provided water supply from a creek. The canal reaches the iron-made water wheel in the lower ground level after entering the facility under the eastern fortification wall in a brick vault-like tunnel, and running southwards under the courtyard. This main canal has branches within the facility, and serves also the workshop far outside. During the excavations, iron parts and one of the bases belonging to the water wheel were found.

Archaeologists discovered around the foundry the existence of a historic underground mine adit and metallurgy pits beside ruins of melting furnaces, slag heap deposits and charcoal piles. Scientific research revealed that processing of cast iron and ferroalloy was done here.

Unearthed archaeological artifacts include molds for round shot, cannonballs of various size, nails of various length, iron powder, ashes, furnace blowpipes, samples of domestic and imported fire bricks, parts of agricultural equipment, porcelain kitchenware and household tools manufactured in later years.

According to Ottoman documents of the 18th and 19th century, the semi-finished products of the foundry were sent to ""Tophane-i Amire"" (Imperial Cannon Factory) and ""Tersane-i Amire"" (Imperial Shipyard) in Istanbul from the port of İğneada on the Black Sea coast.

It is projected that the foundry will be transformed into an open-air museum for industrial archaeology after completion of the archaeological works, currently carried out by 35 archaeologists from several Turkish universities under the supervision of Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. The foundry mosque building will be redeveloped as an industry museum for traditional iron production techniques.

366,567716,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh%20Filmmakers,Pittsburgh Filmmakers,"Pittsburgh Filmmakers was one of the oldest and largest media arts centers in the United States, operating from 1971 to 2019.

The non-profit institution in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania began as a filmmaking equipment access cooperative founded by curator Sally Dixon in 1971. The co-op remained a pillar of the organization throughout its life, supporting projects that grew to include a NASAD-accredited film school, the Three Rivers Film Festival, and three repertory theaters—most prominently the Harris Theater, which remains in operation under the management of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

Artist alumni of Pittsburgh Filmmakers include Peggy Ahwesh, Tony Buba, Greg Mottola, and Victoria Pedretti.

History
Starting in 1969, Chuck Glassmire hosted an experimental film series at the Crumbling Wall coffeehouse at 4515 Forbes Ave. The screenings drew a regular audience from the Carnegie Museum of Art across the street, where Dixon was in the process of launching the museum's Film Section (later Department of Film and Video), one of the first of its kind in the country. In 1970, Dixon raised funding for an expanded screening program, bringing visiting artists to town for in-person exhibitions and providing 16mm filmmaking equipment so that they could also work on new films while in residence. At first called ""Pittsburgh Independent Film-Makers,"" her group secured a space in the basement of the Selma Burke Arts Center at 6118 Penn Circle South in East Liberty. They set up darkrooms and filmmaking facilities, and began to offer workshops in the use of equipment.

In 1971, the group formally incorporated under the name Pittsburgh Filmmakers, with Bob Costa (1971) as its first executive director, followed by Phil Curry (1971-1973) and Robert Haller (1973-1979). Haller, a photographer and curator at Anthology Film Archives in New York, supported the addition of still photography to the organization's mandate. In 1974, when lack of space became an issue, the University of Pittsburgh offered Filmmakers an empty building at 205 Oakland Ave., in the heart of the Oakland university district, for use as an equipment facility. Subsequent executive directors of the organization were Marilyn Levin (1979-1983), Bob Marinaccio (1983-1987), Jan Erlich-Moss (1987), Tony Buba (1988), Margaret Meyers (1988-1991), Kurt Saunders (1991-1992), Marcia Clark (1992), and Brady Lewis (1992). By 1992, the organization had grown to a staff of 18 full-time and 8 part-time employees, and was operating at three more locations—a classroom and editing facility at 218 Oakland Ave., administrative offices around the corner at 3712 Forbes Ave., and the screening program at the Fulton Theater Annex in the Fulton Building at 101 Sixth St.

The organization's longest-serving executive director, Charlie Humphrey (1992-2015), began his tenure with a campaign to modernize and unify the facilities in one location. In the summer of 1995, Pittsburgh Filmmakers opened the doors at 477 Melwood Ave., its home for the next 23 years. The  space, formerly used as Carnegie Mellon University's Tartan Labs, contained an equipment room, classrooms, darkrooms, offices, a cafe, a library, and the 130-seat Melwood Screening Room. That same year, the screening program moved temporarily to a Point Park College venue at 222 Craft Ave., and then found a permanent home at the Harris Theater, a former X-rated movie house at 809 Liberty Ave. in the downtown Cultural District. In early 1998, Filmmakers also purchased the Regent Square Theater, at 1035 South Braddock Ave. The film school received accreditation in 1999, and spurred the introduction of DV video equipment for student use. In 2001, at the organization's point of maximum development, a renovation of the second floor of 477 Melwood added more offices and classrooms, digital editing suites, a sound stage, a gallery for photo exhibitions, and an additional 60-seat theater.

In 2003, a number of the institutional connections that had existed since Pittsburgh Filmmakers' founding were severed. The Carnegie Museum of Art closed its film department, and Point Park College became the first of the organization's partner schools to start its own competing in-house film degree program. In 2006, Pittsburgh Filmmakers merged with the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PCA), following votes by the organizations' respective membership and boards; the combined organization took the new name Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PF/PCA) and used the PCA's Marshall Mansion building in Shadyside as its headquarters. In 2010, PF/PCA attempted further merger discussions with the Pittsburgh Glass Center, but negotiations failed by May 2011. In 2015, Humphrey resigned as executive director. The last executive directors of the organization while it retained the Pittsburgh Filmmakers name were Pete Mendes (2015-2016), Germaine Williams (2017-2018), and Dan Demicell (2018).

Dissolution
In 2018, classes were cancelled and the 477 Melwood building was sold back to CMU. PF/PCA consolidated at the Marshall Mansion location and rebranded as the Pittsburgh Center for Arts and Media (PCA&M). In 2019, the Regent Square Theater was closed, all film operations were ended, and the school's accreditation was withdrawn.

372,1257757,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo%20da%20Silva,Paulo da Silva,"Paulo César da Silva Barrios (born 1 February 1980) is a Paraguayan footballer who plays for 12 de Octubre in Paraguay, as a centre back.

He has previously played top-flight football in Paraguay, Italy, Argentina, England and Spain.

He played for the Paraguay national football team from 2000 to 2017, and is their most-capped player of all time, earning over 100 caps. He played at two World Cups and three Copa América tournaments, helping his country finish as runners-up in the 2011 Copa América.

In 2015, da Silva became a naturalized Mexican citizen.

Club career

Early career
Born in Asunción, Da Silva started his career in the youth divisions of Atlántida Sport Club, arriving at the club at the age of 13. In 1996, da Silva reached the Primera División Paraguaya with Asunción team Presidente Hayes at the age of 16.

Mexico
Before joining Toluca, da Silva played for Perugia and Venezia of Italy, and Lanús of Argentina. He joined Toluca from Paraguayan Club Libertad for the 2003 Apertura. After making his debut, da Silva was a mainstay in Toluca's defence, starting all but one game that he has played and eventually becoming the team's captain due to his leadership on the field. In 2007, he was chosen for the ""Ideal Eleven"" squad of South America and in 2008 he led Toluca to the Apertura 2008 title, being chosen as the best overall player of the tournament by the Mexican media.

Sunderland
On 13 July 2009, Da Silva joined English club Sunderland on a three-year deal. Manager Steve Bruce said ""I'm delighted to have signed a player of Paulo's experience. He is captain of his country and has played at the highest level in South America, so will bring leadership qualities to our side."" His arrival at the Stadium of Light was followed by a long and confusing period in regards to his visa application. Da Silva was granted a work permit to play in England almost immediately, but had to wait for over a month to get his visa before it was eventually granted on 12 August.

He made his debut on 24 August against Norwich City in the League Cup second round, playing the whole 90 minutes of a 4–1 away win. On 12 September he made his first Premier League appearance, replacing Steed Malbranque for the final ten minutes of a 4–1 home win over Hull City.

Da Silva was rotated throughout his first season at the club, but performed consistently when required. Manager Steve Bruce cited 'settlement' as the reason behind playing Da Silva in phases, stating he needed time to adjust to the English game and lifestyle. He was joined at the club by his international teammate Cristian Riveros in May 2010. Da Silva's second season at Sunderland saw him make just three appearances, only one as a starter. His last appearance for Sunderland came in their home defeat to Notts County in the FA Cup on 8 January 2011.

Real Zaragoza
Da Silva joined Real Zaragoza from Sunderland on 31 January 2011 for an undisclosed fee, with his new club in 15th in La Liga at the time. They finished the season in 13th.

Toluca
Da Silva re-joined Toluca on 31 May 2013 in a two-year loan deal from Pachuca.

On 11 May 2015, Toluca announced they had signed da Silva permanently.

In December 2015, da Silva received a Mexican naturalization to disoccupy a foreign place in Toluca's team.

Return to Paraguay
On 26 June 2017, Da Silva returned to Paraguay to play for Club Libertad

In March 2020, da Silva stated that he wanted to retire at Atlántida Asunción.

In December 2021, the 41-year-old da Silva announced that the 2022 season would be his last.

International career

In 1994, da Silva was selected for the Paraguay Under-17 Team barely aged 14.

In 2000, da Silva represented Paraguay U23 at the 2000 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament.

He played for Paraguay in 1997 and 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, but missed the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. However, he was named in the 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He also played at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, featuring in all five of Paraguay's games in their run to the quarter-finals, and provided an assist for Sunderland teammate Cristian Riveros in their 2–0 win against Slovakia in the group stages.

376,2023843,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff%20Loomis,Jeff Loomis,"Jeff Loomis (born September 14, 1971) is an American musician, best known for his role as lead guitarist in the progressive metal band Nevermore during its existence from 1991 to 2011. In 2014, he joined Swedish melodic death metal band Arch Enemy, and in 2021 he joined Graham Bonnet's Alcatrazz as well. As a solo artist he has released two albums and one EP.

Biography

Early days
Loomis got his first instrument at nine or ten years old, but did not start practicing seriously until around the age of 15. As a teenager in Wisconsin he played in a handful of cover bands and three death metal bands before joining more established bands. Guitarists whose style influenced Loomis are Yngwie Malmsteen, Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Tony Iommi and Brian May At the age of 16, Loomis won Wisconsin's Guitar Wars contest.

He auditioned for Megadeth (during the So Far, So Good...So What! era) at the age of 16, after their lead guitarist Jeff Young was fired from the band. After they played a few songs together, Dave Mustaine, the band's frontman and other lead guitarist, thanked Loomis and told him that one day he would become a great guitar player, but because of his age he was not right for the position. Loomis saw Cacophony on tour, and told Marty Friedman, who became very interested, about the audition. Marty tried out for the position and joined the band in 1989. In 2005, Loomis would then share the stage with Megadeth, as the lead guitarist for Nevermore as part of Mustaine's Gigantour festival. Loomis began to work on his solo album Zero Order Phase. At this time Megadeth were having tryouts for a new guitarist once again and invited Loomis to join them. He turned the band down in order to keep working on his solo album. Coincidentally, Loomis's co-guitarist in Nevermore, Chris Broderick, auditioned for Megadeth and was given the part.

Sanctuary (1990–1991)
Not too long after being auditioned for the lead part in Megadeth (which was also auditioned for by Steve Smyth and Chris Broderick, both playing for his later band Nevermore at different points), Loomis was unable to join the band Sanctuary after guitarist Sean Blosl had left. He was able to take his place at this time; however, because of a dispute caused by guitarist Lenny Rutledge wanting to make grunge oriented music, Sanctuary broke up four months afterwards.

Nevermore (1991–2011)

After the break-up, Loomis and former Sanctuary members Warrel Dane (vocalist) and Jim Sheppard (bassist) made plans to form Nevermore, and in late 1994, Loomis became the lead guitarist of Nevermore after the brief period being in Sanctuary. During his time in the band he was the main songwriter of Nevermore. His contributions can be found in albums such as The Politics of Ecstasy, Dreaming Neon Black, This Godless Endeavor (including Steve Smyth, who previously featured in the band Testament) and Nevermore's 2010 album, The Obsidian Conspiracy. Loomis played an important role in developing the sound that Nevermore has today, using 7-string guitars and techniques such as sweep picking. One of his more important musical showcases is the critically acclaimed album Dead Heart in a Dead World, for which he wrote most of the songs before Nevermore. On April 21, 2011, he and drummer Van Williams left Nevermore, citing personal and musical differences with Warrel Dane.

Solo, Arch Enemy and other projects (2005–present)

In 2005, Loomis reported that he would take some time as a break and then begin recording a solo album. He said, ""It's something I've been wanting to do for some time ... It will be like a Jason Becker/Marty Friedman kind of thing."" On April 1, 2008, Loomis said that all 10 songs which had been written had had the drum parts recorded (done by Mark Arrington pretty much overnight) and they would soon begin tracking the rhythm guitar. On July 3, 2008, it was announced that the album would be called Zero Order Phase.  It was released September 30 via Century Media Records. It features guest solos from Ron Jarzombek, Pat O'Brien, and bassist Michael Manring. During this time Dave Mustaine of Megadeth invited Loomis to join as the lead guitarist, but he declined the offer to work on his solo record.

In 2010, he played a guest guitar solo on Keith Merrow's album Awaken the Stone King, released on January 1, 2011. He also played another guest solo in the song ""Racecar"" on Periphery's self-titled debut album.

On April 10, 2012, Loomis released his second solo album Plains of Oblivion through Century Media Records. Marty Friedman, Tony MacAlpine and Chris Poland performed guest solos on the record.

In summer 2012, Loomis embarked on a North American tour with The Contortionist, Chimp Spanner, and 7 Horns 7 Eyes.

In 2013, Loomis started touring with melodic death metal band Soilwork.

It was announced in July 2013, that Loomis would be teaming up with Keith Merrow, Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse, and Alex Rüdinger of The Faceless to record an instrumental album titled Conquering Dystopia, the recording of which will be funded by donations.

On November 17, 2014, Loomis was announced as the new guitarist of melodic death metal band Arch Enemy, replacing Nick Cordle. His first show with them was on November 26 in Lyon, France, when War Eternal European tour kicked off.

In 2017, Arch Enemy vocalist Alissa White-Gluz announced she was collaborating with Loomis for her upcoming solo record.

In January 2019, Loomis said he had been working on material for an upcoming third solo album.

In June 2021, Graham Bonnet released a statement on Facebook that Jeff had joined Graham Bonnet’s Alcatrazz.

Instructional and voice work

Loomis had a monthly column in Guitar World magazine titled ""Merchant of Menace"", where he explained how to play the riffs and solos of Nevermore. In more recent columns, his former co-guitarist in Nevermore, Steve Smyth has co-written the column, which is dubbed ""The Merchants of Menace"". He has also been featured in Young Guitar Magazine, showing guitarists how to play and explain his style and signature guitar in Nevermore.

In 2006, he provided the voice of Thunderbolt Murderface in Williams Street Presents Metalocalypse on Adult Swim.

In 2009, Guitar World released Loomis's first instructional video.

Slated for a late 2010 release, Loomis has recorded a two-part instructional DVD series with RockHouseMethod. Recording took place late fall of 2009.

Equipment

Loomis plays various Schecter seven (and occasionally six) string guitars, including the Jeff Loomis C7 FR Signature Model with EMG 707 pickups and a Floyd Rose tremolo. He also plays a Schecter C-7 Hellraiser with EMG 707 active humbucker pickups, and the C-7 Blackjack with the Seymour Duncan Blackout pickups. Prior to Schecter he played a wide variety of guitars including Ibanez (Politics of Ecstasy period), Gibson, Jackson (Dreaming Neon Black period), ESP (Dead Heart... period), and Warmoth. In the video for ""Believe in Nothing"" he can be seen using an ESP LTD H-307. He also owns a custom ESP Horizon 7. He endorsed Peavey amplifiers and used their XXX head.  After that he endorsed Krank amplifiers and could be seen live using the Krankenstein heads and cabs. As of 2008 Loomis endorsed Engl Amplification and used most of their heads at one time or another, most notably the SE 670, then the Fireball then their Savage heads and then the Engl Special Edition E570 Rack-mounted Preamp with Engl 100W Stereo Poweramp.and Engl cabs loaded with Vintage 30s. Early in 2007, Schecter guitars brought out the Jeff Loomis Signature Schecter 7-string, based on the C-7 Hellraiser model. It features the EMG 707 active pickups, ash body in 'vampyre red satin' and three piece maple neck with maple fretboard and Sperzel locking tuners. At NAMM 08 a new signature model was released. It is the same as his other one but it has a fixed bridge instead of a Floyd Rose. Loomis can also been seen on YouTube playing an electro acoustic LAG Tramontane T100 ASCEBLK.

In January 2014, Schecter announced that the Loomis series had undergone a redesign. They now feature EMG 57-7H and 66-7H active-housed pickups, all-black hardware, a thinner body with a deeper archop, a thinner, un-tinted neck, repositioned volume and toggle controls, stainless steel frets, and the options of either a Hipshot hard-tail bridge (JL-7), instead of the previous TonePros Tune-O-Matic bridge, or a Floyd Rose floating bridge (JL-7FR). The neck was also repositioned for better upper-fret access. It is available in either vampyre red satin or gloss black. and for case on JLFR7 use Schecters SGR1C hard shell case. In 2016, the guitars began featuring Loomis's signature Seymour Duncan active pickups.

As of March 2018 Loomis has left Schecter stating more freedom to play other guitars in his collection, notably Les Pauls and Strats.
In December 2018, he became a Jackson endorsed artist and is under development of a signature model to be released in January 2019.

Loomis uses Ernie Ball strings. His current gauge 9-46+62 in B♭ tuning, he used to use a heavier 10–52 (skinny top, heavy bottom) + 70 gauge along with Dunlop Tortex 1.5 mm Sharp picks. For amplification he is currently using the Line6 Helix rack with Seymour Duncan PowerStage 700.

Biography

Heredia was born in Mexico City and spent his life investigating and exposing the tricks of spiritism.  He worked as a professor at the College of the Holy Cross. At the Catholic Club of New York in 1920, he held a mock séance for five hundred people. He showed the audience how easily one could fake mediumship tricks such as the levitation of objects and how easily people can be fooled in the séance room. Heredia had revealed how the fake ectoplasm ""spirit hand"" was made by using a rubber glove, paraffin and a jar of cold water. The work of Heredia in debunking the tricks of fraudulent mediums has been praised by the skeptic Daniel Loxton.

His book Spiritism and Common Sense (1922) has been described as a ""highly critical examination of paranormal phenomena.""

Heredia was a friend with the magicians Harry Houdini and John Mulholland. In his Magician Among the Spirits (1924), Houdini cited a fraudulent method that Heredia had used to produce a spirit photograph.

399,42051435,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinlechelys,Chinlechelys,"Chinlechelys ( meaning Chinle turtle) is an extinct genus of stem-turtle belonging to Testudinata. It lived in the Norian age of the Late Triassic and is the oldest turtle known from North America. Among turtles it is unique, mostly because of its very thin shell. The type and only species, C. tenertesta, was named and described with the genus by Walter G. Joyce et al. in 2009. It was probably terrestrial, and was found by Joyce et al. to be closely related to Proganochelys, another terrestrial testudinatan.

Discovery and naming
Chinlechelys is known from only one assigned specimen, the holotype NMMNH P-16697 (New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science) recovered from the Norian Bull Canyon Formation (New Mexico, United States). The skeleton consists of the middle of the carapace, the left hypoplastron, rear ribs, a neck spine, isolated osteoderms, and portions of the bridge. The materials were collected separately over several years, but exhibit the same preservation, features, and are all from the same area, so they were assigned to the same individual.

Etymology
Chinlechelys tenertesta was named by Walter G. Joyce et al. in 2009. The generic name is derived from chinle, after the Triassic Chinle Group the holotype was found in, and chelys, Greek for ""turtle"". Tener and testa and based on the Latin words for ""delicate"" and ""shell"", respectively, based on the thinness of its shell.

Description
Chinlechelys is a unique turtle, and was preserved to have an extremely thin shell. Even though the shell has an estimated length of , the thickest section, above the keel, is only  thick, with the average shell thickness being . The shell thickness makes Chinlechelys the thinnest-shelled turtle known from a fully grown shell. The other well-discussed materials of Chinlechelys are dermal osteoderms. Two prominent spines, from the neck region, are well-preserved. They were decidedly not from the edge of the shell, because large amounts of the region of the carapace they would be from were preserved. Also, the pair of osteoderms were unlikely to be from the tail, because of a comparison with Proganochelys. Some spines from the shell are known from Chinlechelys, but it was considered likely that they were extended fully around the shell because of their presence on Proganochelys.

Distinguishing characteristics
Chinlechelys can be distinguished from both derived amniotes and primitive turtles based on the below features, noticed by Joyce et al.: the presence of a plastron, carapace and multi-element neck and tail armour; a dorsal centra hourglass-shaped, platycoelous, and with a distinct ventral keel; dorsal ribs in contact two dorsal vertebrae; the appearance of compressed dorsal ribs that are oriented vertically and only lightly associated with overlying dermal armour; a double contact between the dorsal vertebrae and dorsal ribs only incipient; the carapace and most of plastron laminar in thickness; a carapace with distinct medial ridge that widens towards the end; a plastron with a sloping inguinal notch; and neck armour prongs forming an angular cone.

Classification
Chinlechelys was determined to be a primitive genus, assigned as a relative of Proganochelys in Testudinata. Its armouring shows the evolution of the turtle carapace, and although some basal features like thin ribs suggest a more primitive placement. The cladogram below shows the suspected relationships of Chinlechelys, along with Pronganochelys, Kayentachelys and other basal turtles:

It was the first in British royal history to be photographed while being worn. The gown was made by London dressmaker Mrs James of Belgravia. It's now part of the British Royal Collection. In 2011, the dress was part of a display of royal wedding dresses at Kensington Palace.

Design

The dress was made of white silk satin (the silk was woven at Spitalfields) trimmed with orange blossoms, myrtle, puffs of tulle and Honiton lace. It had a similarly trimmed  silver moiré train, which was carried by eight young ladies aged 15 to 20. The four lace flounces were designed by Miss Tucker and executed by Messrs. John Tucker and Co. of Branscombe, near Sidmouth. A matching lace veil, train trimming and handkerchief were also made. The pattern of the lace depicted cornucopias filled with English roses, Irish shamrocks and Scottish thistles.

Princess Alexandra wore a wreath of orange blossoms and myrtle and carried a bouquet of orange blossoms, white rosebuds, lily of the valley, orchids, and myrtle. Her jewelry consisted of a pearl necklace, earrings and brooch given to her by the Prince of Wales, an opal and diamond bracelet from Queen Victoria, a diamond bracelet given by the ladies of Leeds, and an opal and diamond bracelet from the ladies of Manchester.

Attendants

The bridesmaids wore white glacé silk dresses trimmed with tulle netting and roses, and wreaths of roses.

401,144269,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odder,Odder,"Odder is a town in Jutland, Denmark. The town is the seat of Odder municipality, and is the biggest town in the municipality. It is located 20 km south of Aarhus and 16 km south-east of Skanderborg. 

Odder is part of Business Region Aarhus, and the East Jutland metropolitan area, and is served by the Odder Line since the line's construction in August 2018.

History 
Odder is first mentioned in 1363 as Oddræth. The town was built up around Odder River (Danish: Odder Å), which cross through the town. By 1850, the town had grown to the population of about 900 people, and was granted a license to hold a market twice a year. Around the same time, an unsuccessful application was made to dig a canal to the north-east coast. 

Odder became a railway town in 1884 when Hads-Ning Herreders Jernbane railway line was established, connecting the city to Hou and Aarhus. In 2018, the  railway stretch became a light rail stretch in the Aarhus light rail.

Odder Museum
Odder Museum is located centrally in Odder, next to Odder Water- and Steam Mill (Danish: Odder Vand- og Dampmølle), which is part of the museum. The museum has 400 m² of exhibitions, mainly focussed on local history. The mill is from 1883 and stands as it did when production stopped in 1955.

Churches
There are 2 lutheran churches in the town of Odder. One is part of the Church of Denmark and the other is an independent church following Grundtvigtianism.

Parish Church
Odder Parish Church (Danish: Odder Sognekirke) is located near the pedestrian street in the town, bordering Odder River to the north. It was built in the later half of the 1100s. The altarpiece is from 1640 and made by Peder Jensen Kolding. It portrays the Last Supper and in front of the two pillars are figures of the evangelists of Luke and John. Models of Matthew and Mark sit on top of the altarpiece. On top of the altarpiece is also a model of the Crucifixion of Jesus. The church's pulpit is from 1590-1600 and the sounding board from 1703. The two church bells are from 1847 and 1854 respectively, and both from Copenhagen. The church once had a turret clock from 1656, but when the clock was unable to be repaired in 1856, the clock was removed and despite the church's desire for a new, a new clock was never acquired.

Grundtvigtianist Independent Church
Odder Grundtvigtianist Independent Church (Danish: Odder Grundtvigske Valgmenighedskirke) is located east of Odder Parish Church, also near the center of the town. It is a church, independent from the Church of Denmark, though largely with the same beliefs. The congregation was founded in 1884 and the church built in 1885 and opened in 1886. The drawings for the church were made by Christen Jensen. The altarpiece displays a young Jesus, and is made by Troels Trier. The organ is from 1899, made by Frederik Nielsen from Aarhus.

405,19360175,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit%20crunch,Credit crunch,"A credit crunch  (also known as a credit squeeze, credit tightening or credit crisis) is a sudden reduction in the general availability of loans (or credit) or a sudden tightening of the conditions required to obtain a loan from banks.  A credit crunch generally involves a reduction in the availability of credit independent of a rise in official interest rates.  In such situations, the relationship between credit availability and interest rates changes. Credit becomes less available at any given official interest rate, or there ceases to be a clear relationship between interest rates and credit availability (i.e. credit rationing occurs).  Many times, a credit crunch is accompanied by a flight to quality by lenders and investors, as they seek less risky investments (often at the expense of small to medium size enterprises).

Causes

A credit crunch is often caused by a sustained period of careless and inappropriate lending which results in losses for lending institutions and investors in debt when the loans turn sour and the full extent of bad debts becomes known. 

There are a number of reasons why banks might suddenly stop or slow lending activity.  For example, inadequate information about the financial condition of borrowers can lead to a boom in lending when financial institutions overestimate creditworthiness, while the sudden revelation of information suggesting that borrowers are or were less creditworthy can lead to a sudden contraction of credit.  Other causes can include an anticipated decline in the value of the collateral used by the banks to secure the loans; an exogenous change in monetary conditions (for example, where the central bank suddenly and unexpectedly raises reserve requirements or imposes new regulatory constraints on lending); the central government imposing direct credit controls on the banking system; or even an increased perception of risk regarding the solvency of other banks within the banking system.

Easy credit conditions
Easy credit conditions (sometimes referred to as ""easy money"" or ""loose credit"") are characterized by low interest rates for borrowers and relaxed lending practices by bankers, making it easy to get inexpensive loans. A credit crunch is the opposite, in which interest rates rise and lending practices tighten. Easy credit conditions mean that funds are readily available to borrowers, which results in asset prices rising if the loaned funds are used to buy assets in a particular market, such as real estate or stocks.

Bubble formation

In a credit bubble, lending standards become less stringent. Easy credit drives up prices within a class of assets, usually 
real estate or equities. These increased asset values then become the collateral for further borrowing.
During the upward phase in the credit cycle, asset prices may experience bouts of frenzied competitive, leveraged bidding, inducing inflation in a particular asset market. This can then cause a speculative price ""bubble"" to develop.  As this upswing in new debt creation also increases the money supply and stimulates economic activity, this also tends to temporarily raise economic growth and employment.

Economist Hyman Minsky described the types of borrowing and lending that contribute to a bubble. The ""hedge borrower"" can make debt payments (covering interest and principal) from current cash flows from investments.  This borrower is not taking significant risk. However, the next type, the ""speculative borrower"", the cash flow from investments can service the debt, i.e., cover the interest due, but the borrower must regularly roll over, or re-borrow, the principal. The ""Ponzi borrower"" (named for Charles Ponzi, see also Ponzi scheme) borrows based on the belief that the appreciation of the value of the asset will be sufficient to refinance the debt but could not make sufficient payments on interest or principal with the cash flow from investments; only the appreciating asset value can keep the Ponzi borrower afloat.

Often it is only in retrospect that participants in an economic bubble realize that the point of collapse was obvious. In this respect, economic bubbles can have dynamic characteristics not unlike Ponzi schemes or Pyramid schemes.

Psychological
Several psychological factors contribute to bubbles and related busts. 
Social herding refers to following the behavior of others, assuming they understand what is happening. As John Maynard Keynes observed in 1931 during the Great Depression: ""A sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him."" 
People may assume that unusually favorable trends (e.g., exceptionally low interest rates and prolonged asset price increases) will continue indefinitely. 
Incentives may also encourage risky behavior, particularly where the negative consequences if a bet goes sour are shared collectively. The tendency of government to bail out financial institutions that get into trouble (e.g., Long-term Capital Management and the subprime mortgage crisis), provide examples of such moral hazard.
People may assume that ""this time is different"", which psychologist Daniel Kahneman refers to as the inside view, as opposed to the outside view, which is based on historical or better objective information.
These and other cognitive biases that impair judgment can contribute to credit bubbles and crunches.

Valuation of securities
The crunch is generally caused by a reduction in the market prices of previously ""overinflated"" assets and refers to the financial crisis that results from the price collapse. This can result in widespread foreclosure or bankruptcy for those who came in late to the market, as the prices of previously inflated assets generally drop precipitously. In contrast, a liquidity crisis is triggered when an otherwise sound business finds itself temporarily incapable of accessing the bridge finance it needs to expand its business or smooth its cash flow payments.  In this case, accessing additional credit lines and ""trading through"" the crisis can allow the business to navigate its way through the problem and ensure its continued solvency and viability.  It is often difficult to know, in the midst of a crisis, whether distressed businesses are experiencing a crisis of solvency or a temporary liquidity crisis.

In the case of a credit crunch, it may be preferable to ""mark to market"" - and if necessary, sell or go into liquidation if the capital of the business affected is insufficient to survive the post-boom phase of the credit cycle. In the case of a liquidity crisis on the other hand, it may be preferable to attempt to access additional lines of credit, as opportunities for growth may exist once the liquidity crisis is overcome.

Effects

Financial institutions facing losses may then reduce the availability of credit, and increase the cost of accessing credit by raising interest rates. In some cases lenders may be unable to lend further, even if they wish, as a result of earlier losses.  If participants themselves are highly leveraged (i.e., carrying a high debt burden) the damage done when the bubble bursts is more severe, causing recession or depression. Financial institutions may fail, economic growth may slow, unemployment may rise, and social unrest may increase. For example, the ratio of household debt to after-tax income rose from 60% in 1984 to 130% by 2007, contributing to (and worsening) the Subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2008.

Historical perspective
In recent decades credit crunches have not been rare or black swan events. Although few economists have successfully predicted credit crunch events before they have occurred, Professor Richard Rumelt has written the following in relation to their surprising frequency and regularity in advanced economies around the world: ""In fact, during the past fifty years there have been 28 severe house-price boom-bust cycles and 28 credit crunches in 21 advanced Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies.""

Under the tutorage of Friedrich von Gärtner, director of the royal Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory, Ainmiller studied glass painting, both as a mechanical process and as an art, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich.  In 1828 he was appointed director of the newly founded royal painted-glass manufactory at Munich. The method which he gradually perfected there was a development of the enamel process adopted in the Renaissance, and consisted in actually painting the design upon the glass, which was subjected, as each colour was laid on, to carefully adjusted heating.

The earliest specimens of Ainmiller's work are to be found in the cathedral of Regensburg. With a few exceptions, all the windows in Glasgow cathedral are from his hand. Specimens may also be seen in St Paul's Cathedral and Peterhouse, Cambridge, and the Cologne Cathedral contains some of his finest productions. Ainmiller had considerable skill as an oil-painter, especially in interiors, his pictures of the Chapel Royal at Windsor Castle and of Westminster Abbey being much admired, the latter of which is displayed in the gallery of the Neue Pinakothek in Munich.  He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

Maximilian was also mentor to many famous painters, including future son-in-law David Dalhoff Neal, and grandfather to dramatist Max Neal, and composer Heinrich Neal who was born a few months prior to his death. A street, Ainmillerstrasse, named in his memory, is located in the Munich district of Schwabing

415,5566070,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annibale%20Bugnini,Annibale Bugnini,"Annibale Bugnini  (14 June 1912 – 3 July 1982) was a Catholic prelate. Ordained in 1936 and named archbishop in 1972, he was secretary of the commission that worked on the reform of the Catholic liturgy that followed the Second Vatican Council. Critics and proponents of the changes made to the Roman Rite Mass and other liturgical practices before and after Vatican II consider him a dominant force in these efforts. He held several other posts in the Roman Curia and ended his career as papal nuncio to Iran, where he acted as an intermediary during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 to 1981.

Early life and ordination
Annibale Bugnini was born in Civitella del Lago in Umbria. In 1928 he began his theological studies with the Congregation of the Mission and was ordained a priest on 26 July 1936.

He completed his doctorate in sacred theology at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum in 1938 with a dissertation entitled De liturgia eiusque momento in Concilio Tridentino.

He spent ten years in parish work in a suburb of Rome. In 1947 Bugnini became involved in the production of the missionary publications of his order and became the first editor of Ephemerides Liturgicæ, a scholarly journal dedicated to the reform of the Catholic liturgy. Starting in 1949, he taught liturgical studies at the Pontifical Urban College (now the Pontifical Urban University). He later became a professor at the Pontifical Lateran University.

Curial career
On 28 May 1948, Pope Pius XII appointed Bugnini secretary to the Commission for Liturgical Reform, which created a revised rite for the Easter Vigil in 1951 and revised ceremonies for the rest of Holy Week in 1955. The commission also made changes in 1955 to the rubrics of the Mass and office, suppressing many of the Church's octaves and a number of vigils, and abolishing the first vespers of most feasts. In 1960 the commission modified the Code of Rubrics, which led to new editions of the Roman Breviary in 1961 and of the Roman Missal in 1962.

On 25 January 1959, Pope John XXIII announced his plan to convene the Second Vatican Council. On 6 June 1960 Fr. Bugnini was named secretary of the Pontifical Preparatory Commission on the Liturgy. This body produced the first drafts of the document that, after many changes, would become the council's Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (1963). When the council convened in October 1962, the Preparatory Commission was succeeded by the Conciliar Commission on the Sacred Liturgy, on which Bugnini was assigned the role of a peritus (expert). At the same time, Bugnini was removed from the chair of Liturgy at the Pontifical Lateran University because, in the words of Piero Marini, ""his liturgical ideas were seen as too progressive."" In his posthumously published memoirs, Second Vatican Council consultant Louis Bouyer called Bugnini ""a man as bereft of culture as he was of basic honesty.""
  
The council and Pope Paul VI approved the Constitution on the Liturgy on 4 December 1963. On 30 January 1964, the Pope appointed Bugnini secretary of the Council for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy. Bugnini was appointed the secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship by Pope Paul in May 1969. In January 1965, he had become an undersecretary in the Congregation of Rites responsible for causes for beatification and canonization.

On 6 January 1972, Pope Paul named Bugnini Titular Archbishop of Diocletiana and consecrated him as bishop on the following 13 February.

On 16 July 1975, Pope Paul announced the merger of two curial departments to form the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, ending Bugnini's career in the Roman Curia. His personal secretary was Piero Marini, who is now an archbishop and president of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses.

Diplomatic service
On 4 January 1976, Pope Paul named Bugnini pro-nuncio to Iran. Bugnini studied the country, its history, and traditions. The results of his researches appeared in 1981 as La Chiesa in Iran (The Church in Iran).

In 1979, Bugnini tried unsuccessfully to obtain, in the name of the pope, the release of the American hostages being held at the United States embassy by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He  met with Khomeini to deliver Pope John Paul II's appeal for the release of the hostages. The 52 Americans were released on 21 January 1981, after 444 days in captivity.

Death
Bugnini died of natural causes at the Pope Pius XI Clinic in Rome on 3 July 1982.

His detailed account of the work to which he devoted most of his career, The Reform of the Liturgy 1948-1975, appeared posthumously. An English translation was published in 1990.

Allegation
The oft-repeated allegation of Bugnini's being a Freemason, was first made in print by Italian essayist Tito Casini in his book Nel Fumo di Satana. Verso l'ultimo scontro (Florence: Il carro di San Giovanni, 1976). Casini claimed that according to an anonymous source, Bugnini left a briefcase in a conference room. When someone found it and attempted to identify the owner, incriminating documents were within. English writer Michael Davies claimed that Pope Paul VI's sending of Bugnini to Iran as nuncio was due to this alleged revelation of Bugnini's Masonic affiliation, though the task of his post-Vatican II congregation had just been completed (supra). Davies further claimed that an unnamed, conservative cardinal had told him in the summer of 1975 that he'd ""seen (or placed) on the pope's desk"" a ""dossier"" containing evidence of Bugnini's Freemason connection. Neither of these claims have ever been verified, although more details on these allegations have become available through more recently published interviews with Fr. Charles Murr, who served as an assistant to Cardinal Gagnon during the 1970s.

The Heyward Shepherd monument is a monument in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, constructed in 1931. It commemorates Heyward (sometimes spelled ""Hayward"" or ""Heywood"") Shepherd (1825 – October 16, 1859), a free black man, who was the first person killed during John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. The monument was constructed to promote the pseudo-historical Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth, by falsely claiming that Shepherd was opposed to freeing the slaves.

The monument was erected in 1931, after decades of controversy, by the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and, to a lesser extent, by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The monument was intended to publicize the Lost Cause allegation that the enslaved were happy and did not want freedom; the UDC had a ""Faithful Slave Memorial Committee"". However, the grand jury Bill of Indictment lists 11 Black enslaved men who were allegedly incited to revolt by the accused. One was locked up in the Charles Town jail together with Brown, Green, and the others. The owners of two submitted claims for their losses. Some slaves were observed with weapons inside the Arsenal. The story that Washington and Allstadt's slaves were there only because they were forced to be there is what the slaves had said, after Brown's raid had failed, and their owners wanted to believe that. 

A different view is provided by Osborne Perry Anderson, the only Black in Brown's party who escaped:

However, the official view, in the reports of the Virginians Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee and Governor Henry A. Wise, was that no Blacks participated voluntarily at all. Lee's report did not become public until the report of the Senate Select Committee investigating the incident, over six months later. But Wise's views were widely known, as he stated them clearly in speeches, which appeared in many newspapers.

There is no evidence that Shepherd was opposed to John Brown's plan to end American slavery, or even that he had heard of it. He thought he was dealing with robbers. Nevertheless, the monument was intended to be a reply to Blacks' glorification of Brown, in whose honor Storer College had been established in Harpers Ferry; the college placed a plaque on the Armory in 1918. There was no better place, from the UDC's point of view, for a monument to the ""happy slave"" than Harpers Ferry.

Heyward Shepherd
Heyward Shepherd was a free Black man, born free, over 6 feet (180 cm) in height, who lived in Winchester, Virginia, about  southwest of Harpers Ferry, which two communities were served by the Winchester and Potomac rail line. He owned a small house there, had a wife and five children, according to the 1860 census, and had money in the bank.

He had worked for nearly twenty years as a porter or baggage handler with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, whose trains went back and forth through Harpers Ferry. In Harpers Ferry was the first interline rail junction in the country: there was frequently baggage or freight to move to or from the trains of the Winchester and Potomac Railroad, whose northern terminus was the Harpers Ferry station. The stationmaster was Fontaine Beckham, the popular mayor of Harpers Ferry; when he was absent, Shepherd was in charge of the station. Beckham, who also was killed, ""liked him very much.""

What happened, as described by Shepherd to the physician who treated him, John D. Starry, was ""that he had been out on the railroad bridge looking for a watchman who was missing, and he had been ordered to halt by some men who were there, and, instead of doing that, he turned to go back to the office, and as he turned they shot him in the back."" That was enlarged by the UDC, without documentary foundation, into his rejection of John Brown and an attempt to warn the whites of Harpers Ferry.

He was buried in the Winchester–Fairfax Colored Cemetery, on what is today Route 11, with ""honors of war by the military companies of the town, accompanied by the mayor and other citizens."" However, in 1932 no one could find his grave.

Subsequently, Winchester's Old Colored Cemetery has been paved over and the location used for parking.

Monuments
There has been contention throughout the 20th century as to what plaque, if any, should be displayed next to the UDC's memorial. ""Today the Heyward Shepherd Memorial stands not as a representative of a community's collective remembrance, but rather as a testament to the struggle between Southern whites and African Americans to write their respective memories of the raid into the historical landscape.""

1918 plaque to Brown

The origin of the monument to the ""faithful slave"" is the monument to Brown, posted on the original building, the ""firehouse,"" which had been moved to the campus of Storer College:

THAT THIS NATION MIGHT HAVE
A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM
THAT SLAVERY SHOULD BE REMOVED 
FOREVER FROM AMERICAN SOIL
JOHN BROWN
AND HIS 21 MEN GAVE THEIR
LIVES
TO COMMEMORATE THEIR
HEROISM THIS TABLET IS 
PLACED ON THIS BUILDING
WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN
KNOWN AS
JOHN BROWN'S FORT
BY THE
ALUMNI OF STORER COLLEGE
1918

1931 monument

In 1931, after opposition since it had been proposed in 1920, what was called at the time the Faithful Slave Memorial was erected by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy . The text of the granite monument reads: On the night of October 16, 1859, Heyward Shepherd, an industrious and respected colored freeman, was mortally wounded by John Brown's raiders. In pursuance of his duties as an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, he became the first victim of this attempted insurrection.This boulder is erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of negros who, under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war, so conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to the best in both races.

Although he had objected to the original 1920 proposal as provocative of ""unpleasant racial feeling""—there was a Ku Klux Klan march a year later—Storer College president Henry T. MacDonald gave the opening address, and the College chorus performed.

1932 plaque
The monument was immediately challenged by many as perpetuating the ""happy slave"" concept of slavery as a justification for the practice.

The NAACP responded by preparing a plaque, which they called ""The Great Tablet"", to be displayed at Storer College in Harpers Ferry, where the firehouse used by John Brown as a fort had been moved. The text on the plaque, replying to the ""faithful slave"" allegation that Virginia's happy slaves did not want freedom, states that seven ""slaves and sons of slaves"" fought with Brown, who was ""crucified"". It was written by W. E. B. Du Bois, author of a biography of John Brown and NAACP cofounder. Henry T. MacDonald, the white president of Storer, who had participated in the UDC's 1931 ceremony, refused to allow the plaque to be mounted, because he found it ""too militant"".

In 2006, 74 years later, the plaque was finally given a public place, but a remote one: on the former Storer College grounds, at the Fort's former location. Tourist guides largely ignore it. The plaque reads:

2010 picture of the plaque at its current location. Close-up photo.

1955 plaque
A plaque to contextualize the original 1931 monument was placed in 1955 by the National Park Service. The text of the plaque read:
John Brown's raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry caused the death of four townspeople. One of those who died in the fighting was Heyward Shepherd, a railroad baggagemaster and a free black. Although the true identity of his assailant is uncertain, Shepherd soon became a symbol of the ""faithful servant"" among those who deplored Brown's action against the traditional southern way of life. The monument, placed here in 1931, reflects those traditional views.

The monument was in storage from 1976 to 1980 and then shrouded in plywood, supposedly to protect it from vandalism, until 1995.

1994 plaque
Another plaque was installed near the 1931 monument by the National Park Service, to place the monument in context. It reads: On October 17, 1859, abolitionist John Brown attacked Harpers Ferry to launch a war against slavery. Heyward Shepherd, a free African-American railroad baggage master, was shot and killed by Brown's men shortly after midnight. Seventy-two years later, on October 10, 1931, a crowd estimated to 300 whites and 100 blacks gathered to unveil and dedicate the Shepherd Monument. During the ceremony, voices rose to praise and denounce the monument. Conceived around the turn of the century, the monument endured controversy. In 1905, the United Daughters of the Confederacy stated that erecting the monument would influence for good the present and coming generations, and prove that the people of the South who owned slaves valued and respected their good qualities as no one else ever did or will do.

419,1644176,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French%20Cerdagne,French Cerdagne,"French Cerdagne (, ) is the northern half of Cerdanya, which came under French control as a result of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, while the southern half remained in Spain (as part of Catalonia). Catalans often refer to French Cerdagne as Upper Cerdanya (). It is the only French territory on the Iberian Peninsula, as it is located on the south side of the Pyrenees Range between France and Spain. For example, the Segre river, which goes west and then south to meet the Ebro, has its source in the French Cerdagne. An inadvertent result of the Treaty of the Pyrenees is the Spanish exclave of Llívia (the small uncolored area in the map) which is sovereign Spanish territory surrounded by French Cerdagne.

French Cerdagne has no special status inside France, simply forming an area within the department of Pyrénées-Orientales, unlike the Spanish part of Cerdanya, which is officially a Catalan comarca called simply Cerdanya. In France, the French area is referred to as either Cerdagne française (i.e. ""French Cerdagne""), Haute Cerdagne (i.e. ""Upper Cerdagne"") or just Cerdagne.

French Cerdagne has a land area of 539.67 km² (208.37 sq. miles). Its 1999 population was 12,035, resulting in a density of only 22 people per km² (58 per sq. mile).

French Cerdagne has the most cloud-free days in France, and was therefore chosen as the place to build:

 the solar furnace of Odeillo () (official site), used for high-temperature scientific experiments;
 the Thémis experimental solar power plant (operated by EDF from 1983 to 1986); it is now decommissioned as a power plant, but is being used as a Cerenkov telescope for the detection of Gamma rays

Biography

Struggle for power (1466–1478)

It took Mengli twelve years to establish himself as khan. When Haji Girai died power went to his eldest son Nur Devlet. Mengli revolted. He was supported by the Crimean nobility while Nur Devlet was supported by the Great Horde. In 1467 Mengli occupied the capital of Kyrk-Er (Chufut-Kale) but was soon driven out by Nur Devlet and fled to the Genoese at Kaffa. In June 1468 a delegation of nobles elected him khan at Kaffa.  He, the nobles and a Genoese detachment marched on the capital. After six months Nur Devlet was expelled and fled to the North Caucasus, but was captured and imprisoned in the Genoese fortress at Sudak.

Second reign 1469–1475
He made an anti-Turkish alliance with Principality of Theodoro. In the summer of 1469 a Turkish fleet burned some villages near Kaffa.  From late 1473 Eminek made himself head of the Shirin clan which held the eastern peninsula of Crimea. He became the second most powerful man in the country and was often hostile to Mengli.

In March 1475 the nobles replaced Mengli with his elder brother Hayder of Crimea. Mengli fled to Kaffa.  In May 1475 a large Turkish fleet arrived at Kaffa seeking to subordinate the Genoese. They took Kaffa and other Genoese forts and the Principality of Theodoro. Mengli, who had supported the Genoese, was captured and taken to Constantinople.  Nur Devlet was released from prison and restored as a Turkish vassal.  Nur Devlet's third reign (1475–78) was unsuccessful. In the winter of 1477–78 Crimea was briefly conquered by Janibeg, a nephew of Akhmed Khan of the Great Horde. Eminek wrote to the sultan asking that Mengli be restored. In the spring of 1478 Mengli was released and arrived at Crimea with a Turkish fleet and Turkish soldiers. He was joined by Eminek's troops, Nur Devlet was driven out and Mengli became khan as a Turkish vassal.

Third reign (1478–1515) 
He made a great contribution to the development of Crimean Tatar statehood. He founded the fortress of Özü.

In 1480, Meñli entered into a treaty of alliance with Ivan III, Grand Duke of Muscovy. The alliance was directed against Poland-Lithuania, the Great Horde and the Khanate of Astrakhan. This was an important factor in the Great stand on the Ugra river which led to Russian independence from the Great Horde.

In 1502, Meñli defeated the last khan of the Golden Horde and took control over its capital, Saray. He proclaimed himself Khagan (Emperor), claiming legitimacy as the successor of the Golden Horde's authority over the Tatar khaganates in the Caspian-Volga region.

Meñli was buried in the Dürbe (or türbe) of Salaçıq in Bakhchysarai. In that city, he commissioned Zıncırlı Medrese (medrese with chains) in Salaçıq (1500), Dürbe in Salaçıq (1501), and ""Demir Qapı"" (Iron Gate) portal in the Bakhchisaray Palace (by Aloisio Novi) (1503).

Meñli often depended on troops from the Crimea's numerous Italian trading cities, and Genoese mercenaries formed a significant part of his army.

For his raids on Lithuania see Crimean-Nogai Raids for 1480–1511.

Family 
Meñli was a father of Mehmed I Giray and Sahib I Giray.  One of his wives were Nur Sultan, who are one of only three women known to have played a political role in the Crimean Khanate.

Wives
Meñli's wives were:
Nur Sultan, daughter of Prince Timur ibn Mansur, bey of the Manghits;
Zayan Sultan, probably a daughter of Giray Seyid, a Sayyid;
A daughter of Yadigar, bey of Sedjiuts;

Sons
Meñli's sons were:
Fetih Giray, married to Djalal Sultana, daughter of Musake ibn Hadjike, bey of Manghits;
Mehmed I Giray, married to a daughter of Hasan ibn Timur of Manghits;
Saadet I Giray, probably married to a daughter of Shaman of Manghits in 1526;
Ahmed Giray, married to a daughter of Barash, brother of Devletek, head of Shirin clan;

Daughters
Meñli's daughters were:
A daughter, married to Tinish bin Yankuvat of Manghits;
Makhdum Shah, married to head of Shirin clan, Devletek bin Eminek;
A daughter, married to Suleyman, bey of Kungrats in 1492 or 1493;

Meñli I Giray was once thought to be the maternal grandfather of Suleiman the Magnificent through his putative daughter Hafsa Sultan, but this has been disproved.

423,21817926,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen%20G.%20Larson,Stephen G. Larson,"Stephen Gerard Larson (born October 26, 1964) is a former United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Central District of California and a partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Larson LLP, which he co-founded in 2016 as Larson O'Brien LLP. He consistently ranks among the top litigators in the U.S., having been recognized by The Best Lawyers in America© for his work in Commercial Litigation and Criminal Defense: White-Collar since 2015.

As a judge and an attorney, Larson is known for high-profile cases, including his role from 2011 to 2018 as lead defense counsel in People v. Biane et al., the case which former California Attorney General (and former governor) Jerry Brown once touted as ""the biggest corruption scandal in San Bernardino County, if not the state's, history. Larson won full acquittal for developer Jeff Burum in 2017 and then represented Burum and his company, Colonies Partners, in two civil rights suits against San Bernardino County and its former District Attorney alleging malicious prosecution, among other charges. On November 24, 2020, the parties jointly announced a settlement agreement of $65 million to resolve the litigation. 

Larson represents former USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic in the highly publicized “Varsity Blues” college admissions case against racketeering, conspiracy, and fraud charges. He also represents tax agent Ramin Salari charged alongside former Los Angeles County Assessor John Noguez in a public corruption case. On May 22, 2020, Larson obtained the dismissal before the California Court of Appeal of two separate cases charging Mr. Salari with numerous counts of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud—charges which were recently re-filed in a pair of new complaints. The case, dating back to 2012, became highly publicized after then-Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley stated that it was one of the County’s most significant public corruption cases in decades. In addition to trial practice, Larson frequently advocates before court of appeals across the country. He sat by designation as a United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit judge on seven occasions during his tenure as a U.S. District Judge, since 2015 Larson has appeared before both the California Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the United States.

Larson and United States National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien co-founded Larson O'Brien LLP in January 2016. Before co-founding the firm, Larson was practice leader of Arent Fox's Complex Litigation group. In addition to his trial and appellate work, Larson is a member of FedArb and is frequently engaged as an arbitrator and mediator in complex commercial disputes.

Biography

Early life and education
Larson was born in Fontana, California. He received a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in 1986 where he was a member of the Philodemic Society, and a Juris Doctor from the USC Gould School of Law in 1989. He was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1989.

Prosecutor and federal judge
After two years in private practice at O’Melveny & Myers, Larson began working for the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. From 1991 to 2000, he led 24 criminal trials, was responsible for handling 49 appeals before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and received the U.S. Department of Justice Director's Award for Superior Performance from Attorney General Janet Reno. As chief of the office's organized crime section, Larson conducted joint training exercises and investigations with foreign law enforcement agencies in Russia, Kazakhstan, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, the Ukraine, and South Korea.

Larson's work as a U.S. Attorney led him to the bench, first as a United States Magistrate Judge in September 2000. In December 2005, he was nominated by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the Central District of California vacated by Robert J. Timlin. Larson was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 16, 2006. Important cases he presided over included United States v. Nazario, involving a former Marine sergeant ultimately acquitted of manslaughter for his role in four fatal shootings during the Battle of Fallujah in Iraq; Mattel v. MGA Entertainment, the so-called ""Bratz doll"" case involving copyrights and trade secrets; and United States v. Duro, in which Larson blocked the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs' decade-long effort to close down a major migrant worker camp on the Torres Martinez Indian Reservation in the Coachella Valley.

He resigned his position September 17, 2009, and entered private practice.

Private practice
Larson joined Arent Fox in Los Angeles as a partner in 2011, became the practice leader of the Complex Litigation group in 2013, and earned a string of dismissals in high-profile white-collar and commercial litigation cases. In 2012, Larson secured dismissals of money laundering and conspiracy charges for Angela Aguilar in U.S. v. Noriega, one of the few Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases to go to trial. Larson's push to suppress intercepted communications helped lead to the court's finding of broad government misconduct and, ultimately, a dismissal of charges against his client. In 2012, Larson successfully defended Taco Bell against a lawsuit seeking $51 million in damages over alleged unwanted telephone marketing calls. On October 25, 2012, Larson received the Jennifer Brooks Lawyer of the Year Award from the Western San Bernardino County Bar Association.

In December 2015, Larson argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of Arizona voters challenging the constitutionality of unequally populated voting districts created by a state commission. In their case, Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, Larson and co-counsel argued that the five-member Commission violated the Supreme Court's one-person, one-vote principle under the 14th Amendment.

Upon co-founding his firm in January 2016, Larson was quickly tapped that February to file a legal brief supporting the U.S. government's efforts to force Apple Inc. to unlock the encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the 2015 San Bernardino attack. Soon after, he was hired to serve as interim general counsel for the Ontario International Airport Authority during the time that it was finalizing its separation from Los Angeles World Airports. Larson was also appointed by the Orange County District Attorney and the Orange County Board of Supervisors to monitor the District Attorney’s compliance with a Blue Ribbon commission’s recommendations related to jail informants.

Larson’s 2017 defense of Mr. Burum at trial in People v. Biane et al. led to a full acquittal and a formal apology from the FBI regarding misstatements by agents following a search and seizure. In 2018, Larson received the Daily Journal’s California Lawyer Attorneys of the Year (CLAY) Award for his trial advocacy in People v. Biane et al.

Also in 2017, Larson successfully represented the states of Arizona and Oklahoma in connection with their efforts to seek recovery following the Volkswagen AG emissions “Diesel Dupe” scandal, obtaining settlements totaling more than $40 million. He also obtained a $10 million jury verdict and judgment against the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center and in favor of a minor child abused at the defendant's facilities. In 2019, Larson served as trial counsel in the trial of lawsuit spanning 17 years regarding claims that the federal government mismanaged tribal assets, which resulted in settlements of $82 million and $137 million for the Quapaw Nation and tribe members.

Larson is continuously recognized by the Daily Journal as one of the “Top 100 Lawyers in California,” and by the Los Angeles Business Journal as one of the “LA500: Most Influential People in L.A."" and “Leaders of Influence: Litigators & Trial Lawyers.”

Teaching career
During law school, Larson was an instructor at Daniel Murphy High School in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989. From 1995 to 1999, he was a lecturer at California State University, Long Beach. From 1997 to 2001 he was an adjunct assistant professor at the Glendale University College of Law, and from 2001 to 2005 he was an instructor at the California Southern Law School. He was later an adjunct professor at the University of La Verne College of Law.

Additional work
On October 21, 2020, the General Assembly of the Office of American States (OAS) elected Larson to the Inter-American Juridical Committee for a four-year term beginning on January 1, 2021. He is a founding member with the U.S. Department of State in its Public-Private Partnership for Justice Reform in Afghanistan. He was also a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy and is a frequent lecturer on law and international affairs. Larson was the Distinguished Jurist in Residence and a member of the Board of Visitors at the University of La Verne College of Law and was appointed by founding Dean Erwin Chemerinsky to serve on the Dean's Advisory Council for the newly chartered law school at the University of California at Irvine. He previously served as chair of the Los Angeles County Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Safety.

In 2011, Larson, a Catholic, was awarded the Amar Es Entregarse Award from Diocese of San Bernardino.

Service history
The first twenty members of the class were built in 1927 by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in Manchester, England, for the KUR.  They entered service in 1928, and, with two exceptions, were later operated by the KUR's successor, the EAR, as its 50 class.

The remaining two members of the EC1 class were built and entered service in 1930, and were different in some respects.  They later became the EAR's 51 class.

All of the former EC1 class members were withdrawn from service in the 1950s. Most of their leading bogies (trucks) were salvaged for use in converting EAR 13 class locomotives from s to s, to address the 13 class's initial tendency to de-rail when operating in reverse.

Class list

434,50005470,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph%20Forbes%20Duncan,Joseph Forbes Duncan,"Joseph Forbes Duncan (3 June 1879 – 1 December 1964) was a Scottish trade unionist and politician.

Born in Boat of Bridge in Banffshire, Duncan grew up in Ruthriston near Aberdeen and was educated at Robert Gordon's College.  He left school aged fifteen then, when he was seventeen, moved to London to work for the Post Office.  However, he suffered from poor health, and moved back to Scotland in 1898, finding work in Aberdeen.  While there, he became politically active, joining the local Clarion Club, and lecturing on Marxism.

In 1904, Duncan took up the general secretaryship of the Scottish Steam Vessels Enginemen's and Firemen's Union (SSVEFU); he led it through two strikes, in 1905 and 1907, but both took place against his wishes and achieved little.  The union delegated him to attend the Aberdeen Trades Council (ATC), and through this sat on various town council committees, and also the executive of the Scottish Workers' Representation Committee.  This inspired him to join both the Fabian Society, and the Independent Labour Party (ILP), almost immediately being appointed as its full-time secretary for the East of Scotland.  However, he found the travel involved in this post lonely, and returned to working for the SSVEFU full-time in 1908.

Duncan became chairman of the Aberdeen Trades Council in 1911, in which role he helped refound the National Union of Dock Labourers and establish a local branch of the Domestic Servants' Union.  Most significantly, he founded the Scottish Farm Servants' Union, and became its secretary, this becoming a full-time post in 1918.

Duncan opposed World War I, but served on the Scottish Departmental Committee on Food Production; through this, he managed to obtain exemption from being conscripted.  He stood for the Labour Party (to which the ILP was affiliated) at the 1919 Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire Central by-election, taking 26.4% of the vote but only managing third place.  Later, he also stood unsuccessfully in Moray and Nairn at the 1929 general election, and in the 1935 Aberdeen South by-election.

Duncan was the secretary of the Farm Servants throughout the inter-war period, finally retiring in 1945.  He served on a number of government committees, and in 1926 was the chairman of the Scottish Trades Union Congress.  He championed land nationalisation, but was generally considered to be on the right-wing of the ILP, and one of James Maxton's leading opponents in the Scottish branch of the party.  He was President of the International Land Workers' Federation from the 1920s until 1950.

Charity
Since 2004, Alfa-Bank has been assisting the ""Life Line"", a charity program for saving seriously-ill children. Alfa-Bank was the first company to organise a collection of private donations to the foundation. Since September 2008, bank customers have the opportunity to transfer cash donations to help children with the help of the Alfa-Click Internet Bank or a conventional bank transfer without a bank commission.

Every year, the bank organizes charity events called ""Children's Day"", ""Help me get ready for school"", ""Christmas miracle"".

Education
Since 1995, the bank has been implementing the ""Alfa-Chance"" student scholarship program, giving school graduates from various regions of Russia the opportunity to receive higher education at leading universities in the country. Since 2008, the Bank, in cooperation with HSE, has been implementing a program to provide nominal scholarships to first-year students from Russian regions (except Moscow and St. Petersburg), who won prizes at All-Russian School Olympiads and the HSE Multi-Profile Olympiad. In total, the ""Alfa-Chance"" program involves about 17 institutions of higher education. The Bank is developing the Alfa Fellowship program, which enables young specialists from the United States, Great Britain and Germany to undergo an internship in Russia.

Culture
Alfa-Bank actively works in cultural and educational activities primarily aimed at supporting national art.
On 7 June 2000, the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and Alfa-Bank signed a cooperation agreement, under which the participants agreed to join efforts aimed at the implementation of joint cultural events and creative projects. Every year, with the support of a bank in Russia, exhibitions and concerts are held. In addition, Alfa-Bank participates in the organization of exhibitions and concerts of Russian cultural figures abroad. For example, on 18 February 2000, a concert of the Moscow Virtuosos Symphony Orchestra under the direction of maestro Vladimir Spivakov took place in London. It was the first performance of the band in London for 10 years. The presentation was sponsored by Alfa-Bank.
Alfa-Bank, together with the Moscow Literary Fund, is implementing a scholarship support program for writers aimed at motivating authors to create new works of literature: prose, poetry, drama, translations, books for children.

The bank is also one of the co-founders of the ""Big Book"" National Literary Award.

Alfa-Bank periodically sponsors or participates in organizing concerts of foreign stars in Russia. Among others, Bono(2010), Elton John (1995, 2001 and 2007), Aerosmith (2007), Sting (1996, 2001 and 2006), Whitney Houston (2004), Paul McCartney (2003 and 2004). However, some of the invited singers perform in Russia for the first time. Alfa-Bank organizes an electronic music and technology festival Alfa Future People. The headliners are the ""stars"" of the world electronic scene, such as Paul Oakenfold, Avicii, Skrillex, Pompeya, Tesla Boy, Infected Mushroom, and others.

In July 2014, Alfa-Bank announced the launch of the social project ""City Tours with Alpha"". The Bank provides financial and organizational support to the best museums and a tour desks, supporting the development of city tours.

In early 2021, Alfa-Bank hired the well-known rapper Morgenshtern as a ""youth director"". This was preceded by the appearance of a scandalous video in which the Federal Antimonopoly Service found violations of the law on advertising. The singer's task is to attract 100 thousand young new clients. Some experts see this venture as a reputational risk. After an administrative case was initiated against Morgenshtern in April 2021 for drug propaganda, Alfa-Bank disavowed previous messages and called them an ""advertising stunt"".

Technology
 Alfa-Bank, jointly with MasterCard, has launched the production of AlfaPay wristwatches with an integrated debit bank card based on PayPass technology. To pay for purchases, one doea not need to enter a PIN code or sign. The card shows its number and CVC-code to pay for online purchases.
 Alfa-Bank developed the Alfa-Touch app. It allows you to create a non-personalized card for one year and pay for purchases using the PayPass system.
 Since December 2015, contactless ATMs have begun work in the bank branches. Installation of such ATMs was aimed primarily at improving security when working with an ATM (the inability to read the magnetic strip data by the fraudsters), and secondly, it is speeding up the process of interaction with the device.
 Alfa-Bank together with the manufacturer of prostheses ""Motorika"" developed bioelectric prostheses with a special mount for a card with the function of contactless payment PayPass. This development is aimed at reducing inconveniences for people with disabilities when paying. Prostheses have a special compartment for ""minitag"". To pay for a product or service, it is sufficient to bring the prosthesis to the terminal and confirm the operation with a PIN code in case the check exceeds 1000 rubles. In addition, this prosthesis works with other devices equipped with contactless card readers.
 At the end of 2016, Alfa-Bank's A-Club Private Banking topped the ""Best Russian Bank for Millionaires"" rating, compiled by Forbes, among Russian banks without state participation and was ranked 4th position.

Protection of business reputation
On 21 January 2014, Alfa-Bank and Mikhail Fridman filed a lawsuit for the protection of business reputation against the chairman of the Yabloko Party, Sergei Mitrokhin, the editorial staff of the Izvestia newspaper and the correspondent of this newspaper. They considered that the statements made by Mitrokhin and Izvestia newspaper that ""Aleksei Navalny fulfills the political order of the Alfa Group"" do not correspond to reality and discredit their business reputation. But in the end, the court refused to satisfy the company's claim against Mitrokhin.

Jones Day
In the United States, the Jones Day law firm represents numerous Russian entities including Alfa-Bank and Alfa Group.

Sanctions

On February 23, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of military operations in Ukraine, effectively starting an invasion. This prompted countries to impose severe economic sanctions on Russian individuals, companies, and banks in addition to those placed on Russia in response to the 2021-2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis. On February 24, 2022, US President Joe Biden announced sanctions on several Russian banks, including Alfabank; the restrictions include ""dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity"".  Alfabank's press service made a statement in the Russian press that these sanctions would not affect the bank's operations.

441,296435,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptance,Susceptance,"In electrical engineering, susceptance (B) is the imaginary part of admittance, where the real part is conductance. The reciprocal of admittance is impedance, where the imaginary part is reactance and the real part is resistance. In SI units, susceptance is measured in siemens.

Origin
The term was coined by C.P. Steinmetz in a 1894 paper.

In some sources Oliver Heaviside is given credit for coining the term, or with introducing the concept under the name permittance.
This claim is mistaken according to Steinmetz's biographer.
The term susceptance does not appear anywhere in Heaviside's collected works, and Heaviside used the term permittance to mean capacitance, not susceptance.

Formula
The general equation defining admittance is given by

where

The admittance () is the reciprocal of the impedance (), if the impedance is not zero:

and

where

The susceptance  is the imaginary part of the admittance 

The magnitude of admittance is given by:

And similar formulas transform admittance into impedance, hence susceptance () into reactance ():

hence

The reactance and susceptance are only reciprocals in the absence of either resistance or conductance (only if either  or , either of which implies the other, as long as , or equivalently as long as ).

Relation to capacitance 
In electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric field and by a number of physical phenomena, such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, and impact ionization. As a result, device admittance is frequency-dependent, and the simple electrostatic formula for capacitance,  is not applicable.

A more general definition of capacitance, encompassing electrostatic formula, is:

where  is the device admittance, and  is the susceptance, both evaluated at the angular frequency in question, and  is that angular frequency. It is common for electrical components to have slightly reduced capacitances at extreme frequencies, due to slight inductance of the internal conductors used to make capacitors (not just the leads), and permittivity changes in insulating materials with frequency:  is very nearly, but not quite a constant.

Relationship to reactance
Reactance is defined as the imaginary part of electrical impedance, and is analogous to but not generally equal to the negative reciprocal of the susceptance – that is their reciprocals are equal and opposite only in the special case where the real parts vanish (either zero resistance or zero conductance). In the special case of entirely zero admittance or exactly zero impedance, the relations are encumbered by infinities.

However, for purely-reactive impedances (which are purely-susceptive admittances), the susceptance is equal to the negative reciprocal of the reactance, except when either is zero.

In mathematical notation:

The minus sign is not present in the relationship between electrical resistance and the analogue of conductance  but otherwise a similar relation holds for the special case of reactance-free impedance (or susceptance-free admittance):

If the imaginary unit is included, we get

for the resistance-free case since,

Applications
High susceptance materials are used in susceptors built into microwavable food packaging for their ability to convert microwave radiation into heat.

Scott Community Center is a historic site located at Shady Side, Maryland in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. It now consists of two frame buildings that were built as Rosenwald Schools. 

The buildings originally were built on separate sites. The Churchton School was constructed in 1921 and the Shady Side School was constructed in 1926. Both were built as single-story schools with two-room-plans. Decades later, one of the school buildings was moved to the site of the other, and expansion followed. 

The Churchton school was moved to the Shady Side School site in 1953. A wing was added in 1958.

The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

446,20976283,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.%20H.%20Burnside,R. H. Burnside,"Robert Hubber Thorne Burnside (August 13, 1873 – September 14, 1952) was an American actor, director, producer, composer, and playwright. He was artistic director of the 5,200-seat New York Hippodrome from 1908 to 1923.  He wrote and staged hundreds of dramas, musicals and theatrical spectacles.

Early life and education
Burnside was born in Glasgow, Scotland. His father was George Burnside, a manager of the Gaiety Theatre in Glasgow. His mother was Margaret Thorne, an actress, whose father was William Hubberthorne, a theatre proprietor. His siblings were Janet Agnes (born about 1853), John, Ann R., Isabella, and George. Burnside attended the Great Yarmouth Academy.

Career 
As a child Burnside traveled on theatrical tours with his mother. His first stage appearance was as a dog in The Bohemian Girl in a royal command performance, starring Edward O'Connor Terry, before the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. Burnside attended school in Great Yarmouth. He took a brief break to join a wagon circus at age six but returned to school when the venture proved unsuccessful. The family eventually moved to London and Burnside became a call boy to the Gaiety Theatre. He was befriended by director and stage manager Richard Barker who, observing Burnside's eagerness, taught him much about theater.

According to his passport application, he arrived in New York in October 1894, invited by Lillian Russell to direct her productions.  Beginning in 1900, he directed musicals at Broadway theatres. He was artistic director of the 5,200-seat New York Hippodrome from 1908 to 1923. He composed the scores, wrote the librettos for, and directed the Broadway productions The Tourists, Fascinating Flora (which he also produced), Jack o' Lantern, Happy Days, Good Times, Tip Top and Better Times.  The New York Times praised his book for the musical Miss Billions in 1919.  He was the librettist and director for A Trip to Japan (1909, which he also produced), The International Cup, Chin Chin, Hip Hip Hooray!, The Big Show, Cheer Up, Everything, Stepping Stones, and Three Cheers.  He also directed the Broadway productions of others' works, such as The Emerald Isle (1902), The Earl and the Girl (1905) and many others.  He joined ASCAP in 1914 as a charter member and collaborated with such composers as Raymond Hubbell and Gustave Kerker.  His most famous songs were ""You Can't Beat the Luck of the Irish"", ""Ladder of Roses"", ""Nice to Have a Sweetheart"" and ""Annabelle Jerome"".  In 1935, 1942 and 1944, he staged many revivals of Gilbert and Sullivan operas on Broadway.

The recording ""The Ladder of Roses"" from Hip-Hip-Hooray (1916) is not just a rendering of the song but documents a supposed rehearsal with Burnside in charge. He offers pointed and humorous criticism of the women's chorus, which finally sings the song's refrain at the recording's conclusion. During the course of Burnside's near-monologue, he introduces double entendres referencing some of the notable Hippodrome shows such as Chin-Chin, Stop, Look, Listen and Cheer-Up.  Here are two brief excerpts:

BURNSIDE:  How many absences Mr. Stewart? Only one? Ah – Cleopatra Cassidy again!  Wonder what the excuse will be this time. I suppose she's had a fire in her house and she's waiting for the engines to arrive. Ah, here she is now. Good morning, Cleopatra. What's the trouble this time? Subway tied up again?  No?  Well, what happened? You're fifteen minutes late and everybody's waiting for you. What's that?

CLEOPATRA: Had some trouble with my motor again!

BURNSIDE: Well, you'll have some trouble with your salary again at the end of the week. Now come along everybody and let's get this rehearsal started.  (choristers start talking noisily among themselves)  Stop talking girls! This isn't a suffragette meeting.

Another excerpt: ""Now stop, look, and listen all of you. The singing last night was awful. You must pay more attention to the musical director. All except you, Agnes – you're paying too much attention to him. If you don't stop it, I'll call his wife's attention to you!""  This recording was reissued on CD in the 1990s on the set Music from the New York Stage, 1890–1920

In 1924, he directed the film Manhattan.

Burnside was the Shepherd (president) of The Lambs club from 1918 to 1921.

Personal life 
In 1905, Burnside married Katherine.  The couple had three daughters, Catherine, born about 1907, Helen Marguerite, born March 1, 1912, and Betty, born about 1914. Helen married George Edward Blewitt on September 21, 1935. Burnside became a naturalized American citizen in Manhattan on July 3, 1917.  His wife Katherine died in 1940.

Burnside died at the Middlesex Nursing Home in Metuchen, New Jersey.

Legacy 
Because of his position as director and producer at the Hippodrome, Burnside inherited the legacies of Charles Dillingham and Charles Frohman.  Upon his death, the material – including an extensive correspondence, business records, scripts, costume designs and other material – was donated to The New York Public Library. There the business records and correspondence are in the Manuscripts Division; scripts, production notes and designs are in the Billy Rose Theatre Division, and musical scores are held in the Music Division.

He received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Second Battle of Fort Fisher on January 15, 1865.

Military service
Emigrating from his native Wales, Griffiths volunteered for service in the Union Army in 1864 as a private in the 30th Massachusetts Infantry. Within 30 days of his army enlistment, Griffiths transferred to the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the Union brig . His enlistment is credited to the state of Massachusetts.

On January 15, 1865, the North Carolina Confederate stronghold of Fort Fisher was taken by a combined Union storming party of sailors, marines, and soldiers under the command of Admiral David Dixon Porter and General Alfred Terry. Griffiths was a member of the storming party.

Medal of Honor citation
The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Captain of the Forecastle John Griffiths, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving on board the U.S.S. Santiago de Cuba during the assault on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, on 15 January 1865. As one of a boat crew detailed to one of the generals on shore, Captain of the Forecastle Griffiths bravely entered the fort in the assault and accompanied his party in carrying dispatches at the height of the battle. He was one of six men who entered the fort in the assault from the fleet.

449,25844504,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent%20Agrarian%20Party,Independent Agrarian Party,"The Independent Agrarian Party (, SKS) was a Slovenian political party in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was active between 1919 and 1926, when it merged with the Slovenian Agrarian Labour Republican Party into the Slovenian Peasant's Party. In the early 1920s, it was the second largest party in Slovenia, after the Slovene People's Party.

The party was founded in 1919. It was initially meant as the rural branch of the largely urban Yugoslav Democratic Party. However, it soon became fully independent. The party was mostly supported by wealthy farmers and the rural middle class. In the elections for the Yugoslav constitutional assembly of 1920, it gained 21% of the votes in Slovenia, thus becoming the second largest Slovenian party, after the Slovene People's Party, and it gained 8 of the 38 Slovenian seats in the Yugoslav Parliament. In the municipal elections of 1921, the Independent Agrarian Party maintained approximately the same percentage of votes, and managed to defeat the Slovene People's Party in several districts of southern Slovenia (Lower Carniola and White Carniola) and in the Celje region.

In the discussions on the Yugoslav constitution in 1921, the party adopted a rigidly centralist attitude. As the majority of the Slovenian population at the time supported some sort of territorial autonomy for Slovenia, this decision proved very damaging for the party's future success. In the parliamentary elections of 1923, the party suffered a severe defeat, losing more than half of its votes, gaining around 9% of the Slovenian votes, and only 1 MP in the Yugoslav Parliament. In the 1925 elections, the party did not manage to improve its result.

After the defeat of 1925, the party gradually shifted its program. It formed an alliance with the left wing Slovenian Agrarian Labour Republican Party of Albin Prepeluh, and adopted a program which was more favourable to Slovenian autonomy within Yugoslavia. In 1926, the two parties merged in the Slovene Peasant Party, which inherited the organization structure of the Independent Agrarian Party, but whose program and ideology was much closer to the left wing agrarianism advocated by Prepeluh's Agrarian Labour Republican Party.

Biography
Moes was born in Amsterdam where she attended the Rijksacademie voor Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam and followed lessons under August Allebé in the ""ladies' class"", together with the pupils Arina Hugenholtz, Alida Loder and Antoinette Zimmerman. In 1878 she left with a few other pupils after their petition to dismiss a few professors was refused. She returned in 1880 when Allebé became director. She remained on friendly terms with him and they continued correspondence after she graduated.

In the summer of 1880 Moes met the portrait painter Thérèse Schwartze who introduced her to her network of friends and patrons. After a short stay in Germany she returned to Amsterdam and graduated officially in 1884. That January she travelled with Schwartze to Paris where they worked on their submissions for the Paris Salon. Only one of her paintings was accepted and it was hung very high up on a wall. In May the painters returned to Amsterdam and Moes began her own workshop in the home of her mother on the P.C. Hooftstraat. That same summer she went to the art colony Laren for the first time where she met the painters Anton Mauve, Max Liebermann and Jan Veth.

Though she was not an etcher, she received an invitation in 1885 to make a submission for the newly formed Dutch Etcher's Club and submitted an etching for several years after that to their yearly magazine. In this period she became a member of Arti et Amicitiae and sold a painting to Museum Boijmans van Beuningen. Moes exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.

In 1898 she moved to Laren where she lived in Hotel Hamdorff, a meeting place for artists. In 1908 she had to move out due to arthritis and gave up painting and began to write stories, living in a converted home that Veth had helped her to set up in Laren. Her decades of work specializing in everyday scenes of Laren's people earned her a place in the town's history: A local prize for volunteer work is named after her.

Moes died in Laren and Jan Veth read her eulogy. Her autobiography wasn't published until 1961.

454,36859021,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justo%20Justo,Justo Justo,"Justo Justo was a Filipino columnist and Pasay city councilor. He was known as a flamboyant AIDS activist.

Early life
Panfilo C. Justo, widely known as Justo C. Justo or simply JJ, came from a poor family in the sitio of Manlumay, Leyte. He was born to Francisco Justo Sr.  and Ma.

JJ founded Pasay Aids Watch and Information Drive (PAWID), and used his own foundation JJ Barangayan (Phils.) Foundation, Inc. to fight against the spread of AIDS.

Justo used to host a television program titled Etchos Lang, and gained attention for the cause when he convinced AIDS victim Sarah Jane Salazar to share her story to the public.

He also played a leading part in the establishment of the ""Home for the Golden Gays"", a retirement home for homosexuals such as Walter Dempster.

Political life
JJ was among the first media celebrities to make the transition to public office. 
He started his career in the political arena as a Kagawad and later became a barangay chairman in 1987.

457,21563916,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton%20and%20Peterborough%20Railway,Northampton and Peterborough Railway,"The Northampton and Peterborough Railway was an early railway promoted by the London and Birmingham Railway to run from a junction at Blisworth to Northampton and Peterborough. The Northampton and Peterborough Railway Act received the Royal Assent in 1843 and the line opened in 1845. In 1846, it became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The LNWR became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) when the railways of Great Britain were merged in the grouping of 1923. In 1948, the LMS became part of the publicly owned British Railways. Regular passenger services ceased in 1964 and the line closed completely in 1972. A part of it has since been reopened as the Nene Valley Railway heritage line.

Origin

Competing schemes
There had been two original schemes for lines between London and Birmingham.  One proposed by John Rennie would go via Oxford and Banbury.  The other proposed by Francis Giles would go via Bletchley, Rugby and Coventry.

Amalgamation
In 1830 the two decided to amalgamate, adopting Rennie's plan which, as a canal builder, he had laid out following fairly level country.  George Stephenson was asked to plan the line and he passed it to his son Robert who carried out a further survey favouring a route very similar to that proposed by Giles, much to the annoyance of Rennie.

Northampton bypassed
While there was a certain amount of opposition from landowners, the people of Northampton were much in favour of the line. However, in the end, it bypassed the town, following higher ground to the west, through Blisworth and Weedon. At that time it was normal for new lines to bypass the larger towns because of inherent complication and the cost of land.  On the other hand, in those days, the time taken to travel to the station was not seen as a handicap, given that the total journey would be much quicker than anything that had been known before. In addition, a rail link to Weedon Barracks was seen as strategically important.

The Peterborough line
The London and Birmingham Railway opened in 1838 and, four years later, a delegation from Northampton approached the directors with a proposal to build a branch which would run through to Peterborough, which at that time also had no railway although a number of schemes were being proposed.

The Bill for the line's construction met considerable opposition from those who favoured the Northern and Eastern Railway which was progressing to Cambridge and Peterborough. However the Northampton and Peterborough Railway Act received the Royal Assent in 1843.

Construction
Once again the engineer was Robert Stephenson. The line would be relatively easy to build, following the valley of the River Nene to Peterborough, with only a small tunnel to the west of Wansford.  Stations would be provided wherever the line crossed a turnpike where there would be level crossings.   Most of the line was raised on embankments because of the likelihood of flooding. In spite of this it occurred from time to time. In 1852 for instance several bridges were swept away and the line was closed for a week.

Opening
The line opened from Blisworth to Northampton in May 1845 and then throughout in June, the 47 miles having taken only a year to build. The station at Blisworth was rebuilt next to the junction, and Northampton people at last had their train service to London.  In 1846 the line, along with the London and Birmingham, became part of the London and North Western Railway.

Track doubling
Although the infrastructure of the line had been built for double track, only a single track was laid from Northampton to Peterborough, with a passing loop at Thrapston.  This single line working was facilitated by the installation of electric telegraph.  However it became clear that the traffic would be such that doubling would be required very quickly and this was completed by September 1846.

Train services
There were five trains each way on weekdays and Saturdays, with two on Sunday, and extra services between Northampton and Blisworth. Initially the goods traffic was cattle and coal but later iron ore became important.

Connections
In 1857 the Midland Railway built a line from Wigston to meet the GNR at Hitchin via Wellingborough.  It built a spur to the LNWR station for goods.  In 1861 the LNWR began running trains from Wichnor near Burton on Trent and the Midland then began running trains between Wellingborough and Northampton. The Midland built a small station in 1866 near the LNWR's (the latter becoming Northampton Bridge Street in 1876). This little station closed in 1872 when the Midland built its main line from Bedford and opened a new station at St John Street. In 1881, the LNWR opened the Northampton Loop Line which placed the town on a through service superseding Blisworth. At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.

Closure
The use of level crossings had reduced the costs of building the line, but it greatly increased operating expenses and it became be a major reason for the line being closed to passengers by British Rail in 1964.  Some passenger trains still ran from the boarding school at Oundle until 1972 when the line closed completely.

The Northampton and Peterborough Railway closed in 1964, followed 2 years later by the closure of Peterborough East station and the passenger services to Rugby The line between Rugby and Nassington remained open until the line was finally closed with the track remained in situ. The remaining village stations including Helpston and Ketton & Collyweston on the Syston and Peterborough Railway ceased in the same year, although line remains open with through passenger services.

Nene Valley Railway
Part of the Northampton and Peterborough Railway has been reopened as the Nene Valley Railway heritage line.

Her early publications were anonymous but after 1842 she published in her own name. She was the most productive 19th-century Norwegian author of cookbooks and housekeeping guides.

Biography
The daughter of Hans Arnt Poulsen (1768–1809) and Sara Elisabeth Bergström (1770–1845), she was brought up at Skansgården near Kongsvinger in south-eastern Norway. In 1817, she married Lieutenant Lauritz Christian Steen Bang who from 1829 to 1839 was imprisoned for embezzlement while working at Norges Bank in Christiania (now Oslo). While he was in prison, Maren Bang earned a living by selling meals, which she either delivered herself or sold from home. She recorded her recipes, first publishing Huusholdnings-Bog, indrettet efter den almindelige Brug i norske Huusholdninger (Housekeeping Book, Prepared in Accordance with Normal Practice in Norwegian Households) in 1831, with new editions in 1834 and 1838. A selection of her recipes was published separately as Den Norske Kokkepige (The Norwegian Cooking Girl) in 1835.

Later publications included Huusholdningsbog for Almuen Housekeeping for General Use), Slagtebog (Charcuterie), Almindelig Syltebog (Preservation and Pickling), Nyttige Huusraad (Useful Housekeeping Tips), Bagebog (Baking Book) and Praktisk Farve-Bog for Almuen (Practical Methods of Dyeing).

In 1849, the couple moved to Kristiansand where Lieutenant Bang ran a restaurant until his death in 1862. Thereafter, Maren Bang returned to her writing, undertaking major revisions of her earlier works while publishing Vinbog (Wine Book) and Raad og Veiledning for Landmanden (Advice and Guidance for Countrymen).

Bang spent her later years in Kristiania where she died of gastroenteritis on 3 July 1884.

462,7532133,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%20Collins,Simon Collins,"Simon Philip Nando Collins (born 14 September 1976) is a British-Canadian drummer and former lead vocalist of the progressive rock band Sound of Contact. Collins is the son of English drummer and singer Phil Collins and Collins's first wife, Andrea Bertorelli. He is the brother of actress Joely Collins and paternal half-brother of actress Lily Collins. Reviewers have compared his vocals to those of his father.

Early life
Collins was born on 14 September 1976 in Hammersmith, London, England. He is the eldest son of English drummer and singer-songwriter Phil Collins and his first wife, British-Canadian citizen Andrea Bertorelli. He moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1984, when he was 8 years old, after his parents' divorce. He lived with his mother, Andrea, and his sister, Joely, in nearby Richmond between the ages of 8 and 11.  In September 1987, they moved into an estate purchased in Vancouver's Shaughnessy neighbourhood with assistance from their father, a decision described by Andrea Collins as a means to a better education for Collins and his sister and for the sake of other lifestyle considerations. In 1991, Simon's parents were involved in a court battle at the Supreme Court of British Columbia to gain possession of the estate, owing to a misunderstanding of the terms of ownership of the home. Their father had previously placed the estate in an irrevocable land trust in 1987, however, to be owned by both children jointly in adulthood. Their father succeeded in retaining control of the estate until Simon's twentieth birthday, as the judge ruled in October 1991 he was not old enough to sign his half of the estate to his mother as she had intended. Collins completed his secondary education at Vancouver's Point Grey Secondary School.

He first became involved with music when he was five after his father purchased for him a Tama drum kit. Collins practised drumming by playing along with music albums in his parents' record collection as well as when accompanying his father while on tour with Genesis. Collins' experiences on tour allowed him to be mentored by his father and by the band's touring drummer, Chester Thompson. Though he had a percussion instructor when he was ten, Collins preferred drumming to artists such as Stewart Copeland, Gavin Harrison, and Keith Moon over his formal lessons in jazz drumming. Simon made his first onstage appearance alongside his father at the age of 12, performing drums on ""Easy Lover."" He also appeared onstage for a performance during the Seriously, Live! World Tour.

In his early teens, Collins learned to play the piano and began to develop songwriting and singing skills. While he played drums in numerous hard rock bands beginning at age 14, Collins wanted to pursue singing, songwriting, and diversity in music styles, including pop, progressive rock, rock and roll, punk, grunge, and electronica. According to Collins, he did not wish to spend his life ""drumming to other people's music."" His early compositions were rejected by the heavier rock bands he played for because of their pop style.

In his late teens, Collins worked part-time as a disc jockey in Vancouver's rave scene. His experiences in rave culture inspired a collaborative documentary project with his sister Joely called Summer Love.

Collins developed a passion for astronomy and social issues during his youth, and frequently revisits these themes in his music.

Music career

Solo career and collaborations
Prior to the beginning of his solo career, Collins was a member of the local punk band Jet Set. Collins was signed by Warner Music following a release of demo tapes he had recorded in 2000. It was at this time that Collins moved from Vancouver to Frankfurt, Germany, where his debut album All of Who You Are was released. The album saw 100,000 copies sold in Germany and three singles were released off it: ""Pride"", ""Money Maker"" and ""Shine Through"". The album's sales have been attributed to the success of the single, ""Pride."" A second single, ""Shine Through"", was co-written by Collins and Howard Jones.

In 2003, Collins left Warner Music and returned to Vancouver to start his own record label, Lightyears Music. On the Lightyears label two years later, Collins released his second album, Time for Truth. He played a variety of instruments on the album in addition to providing the majority of the vocals. In 2007, he recorded a cover of Genesis' Abacab track ""Keep It Dark,"" as a tribute to Genesis, with keyboardist and co-producer Dave Kerzner. During production of ""Keep it Dark"", Collins met Kevin Churko, who mixed and mastered the recording; Collins later had Churko work with him on the production of his third album, U-Catastrophe.

U-Catastrophe, released in 2008 on iTunes, became Collins' first North American recording project. The album's first single, ""Unconditional"", debuted on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart at No. 30 in September 2008. It later peaked at No. 12 on Billboard in November 2008 and charted on the Canadian Hot 100 in the same month. Kerzner, Kelly Nordstrom, and Steve Hackett were featured on ""Fast Forward the Future""; Phil Collins appeared on ""The Big Bang"".

Sound of Contact

In late 2009, Collins approached Kerzner with the idea of forming a new band. After bringing the idea to musicians Matt Dorsey and Kelly Nordstrom, the four of them began working together at Greenhouse Studios in Vancouver. The band, known by December 2012 as Sound of Contact, included Collins on lead vocals and drums, Kerzner on keyboards, Dorsey on bass, and Nordstrom on guitar. The band's debut album, Dimensionaut, was released in May 2013. Soon after the release of Dimensionaut, Nordstrom left the band; Kerzner left in January 2014.  Both rejoined the group in April 2015 and, subsequently, Sound of Contact began working on their second album.

463,2371231,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter%20kick,Flutter kick,"The flutter kick is a kicking movement used in both swimming and calisthenics.

Swimming

In swimming strokes such as the front crawl or backstroke, the primary purpose of the flutter kick is not propulsion but keeping the legs up and in the shadow for the upper body and assisting body rotation for arm strokes. The legs are extended straight backwards in line with the body. They are moved up and down, one leg kicking downwards (relative to the front of the swimmer's body) as the other leg moves up. The knees are slightly bent to facilitate the kicking action, but not too much in order to minimise drag created by the thighs as they move out of the shadow of the swimmer's body. Similarly, toes are pointed to minimize drag.

The downward moving leg provides the thrust. An integral part of the kick is the flexing of the ankles; it is the flexing of the ankle that allows the foot to provide thrust. The knees are not kept rigid when kicking but are allowed to flex slightly to allow the required ""snapping"" action through the end of the toes.

Scuba diving
Most scuba diving training organizations are agnostic as to kick techniques, and thus most underwater divers utilize the flutter kick of surface swimmers. However, as divers use swimfins, propulsion occurs almost entirely from the kick. Divers that subscribe to the Doing It Right approach and many other cave and wreck divers use a modified flutter kick or frog kick, done entirely with bent knees, pushing water up and behind the diver to avoid stirring up sediment on the bottom.

Calisthenics
The calisthenics version of the flutter kick is often used as an intensive training tool in the military. They help to develop the hip flexors, abdominal muscles and leg muscles. Flutter kicks are a four-count exercise. Starting position is lying flat on the back with the feet and head approximately 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground. Hands are under the buttocks to support the lower back. Count one: raise the left leg to a 45-degree angle, keeping the right leg stationary. Count two: raise the right leg off the ground to a 45-degree angle while, at the same time, moving the left leg to the starting position. Counts three and four are repetitions of the same movements. Legs must be locked, with toes pointing away from the body.

The dam was built for navigation, water supply and hydroelectric power generation as it supports a  power station. It was constructed between 1987 and 1994 and the last of its generators was commissioned in 1997.  In Portuguese, the dam is called the Usina Hidrelétrica de Xingó.

Construction
Studies for the Xingó Dam were done in the 1950s and contracts for construction were not awarded until 1982.  Construction on the dam began in March 1987 but stopped in September 1988 because a debt crisis stalled funding. Construction commenced again in 1990 and by 1994, the dam was complete. On June 10, 1994, the dam began to impound the river as its reservoir began to fill. On November 15 of that year, the reservoir reached its maximum level of . The power station's first generator was commissioned in December 1994, the next two in 1995, two more in 1996 and the final generator in August 1997.

Dam
The Xingó is a  long and  high concrete face rock-fill dam. It contains five zones of  of fill, mostly granite. Four saddles dams (dikes) are also used to support the reservoir.

Part of the reservoir and the canyons upstream to the Paulo Afonso Hydroelectric Complex are protected by the  Rio São Francisco Natural Monument.

Power plant
The Xingó Dam's power station is directly southwest of the dam and is  long,  high and  wide. It was designed by Promon and contains 6 x  Francis turbines that were manufactured by Siemens. The plant also is designed to accommodate another four identical generators that if installed would bring its installed capacity to .

473,18911923,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%20Salle%20Secondary%20School,La Salle Secondary School,"La Salle Secondary School is a high school located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. La Salle is a medium-sized school, consisting of an average student count of 700. The school schedule is composed of four courses and MSIP. The student body is predominantly composed of students from the adjacent suburbs, the military base, as well as many rural communities located along or near Highway 2, and Highway 15.

Daily schedule
The four courses are the same as any public high school in the Kingston region, with the exception of lasting an hour compared to the usual hour and fifteen minutes. The fifteen minutes from each class is added on to MSIP (Multi-Subject Instructional Period). This creates the five period day. This class is meant as an extra hour to work on class work, talk to teachers and allow students to interact with students from different grades.

Athletics
La Salle's team colours are black and gold. Their athletic teams are all known as the ""Black Knights"". The school competes in many sports including cross-country, soccer, hockey, rugby, football, basketball, cheerleading, curling, field hockey, badminton, skiing, skateboarding, and tennis. La Salle Secondary School is a AA-level school, a designation determined by enrollment levels. This creates a disadvantage in athletics; however their senior girls' basketball team won KASSAA in 2007 and 2008, and won the EOSSAA AA championship in 2008-2013.

Their Senior boys' rugby team has also been very competitive, winning KASSAA, going undefeated for  three straight seasons in 1999, 2000, 2001 also in 2013
, also winning back to back years in 2007 and 2008, and winning AA EOSSAA in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The Senior boys' football team has been the Kingston AA representative in provincials for the past couple of years, with their best finish coming in 2008 in the EOSSAA final, before losing to a strong Gananoque Trojan team. The sir team in the 2010s found great success in the second half with a 2016 kassaa championship win over the frontenac falcons and they followed that up with AA EOSSAA championship and a AA ofsaa national capital bowl championship. The Jr Football team had quite a run in 2011 as the league switched to AA/AAA format meaning the AA football teams have their own Championship which the JR Black Knights won becoming the first KASSAA AA jr football champions. They ended up in the EOSSAA final where they lost to the defspe crer was hereending AA OFSAA champion St Mary's Crusaders 16 - 9. In 2014 the jr black knights won Eossaa and the Aa national capital bowl.

In the Kingdom of Croatia, Demetrius Zvonimir was the only notable person that ruled over the region of Slavonia with the title ban from around 1070 until 1075. From 1102, the title Ban of Croatia was appointed by the kings of Hungary, and there was at first a single ban for all of the Kingdom of Croatia, but later the Slavonian domain got a separate ban. It included parts of present-day Central Croatia, western Slavonia and parts of northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. From 1225, the title started being held by a separate dignitary from the title of the Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, and existed until 1476, when it was joined with the latter title.

According to the public law of the Kingdom of Hungary, bans were counted among the ""barons of the realm"" and thus they enjoyed several privileges connected to their office.

477,11119235,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrofan%20Ban,Mitrofan Ban,"Mitrofan Ban (Serbian Cyrillic: Митрофан Бан; 15 May 1841 – 30 September 1920) was Bishop of Cetinje, Metropolitan of Montenegro, and exarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. He was also Archimandrite of the Cetinje monastery. He presided over the Holy Bishopric Synod (1919-1920) that unified the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1920.

Life 

Mitrofan Ban's birth name was Marko Ban, and he was born on May 15, 1841 in the village of Glavati in Grbalj region in the Austrian Empire, to Georgije and Anastasija Ban. He is related to writer Matija Ban of Petrovo Selo. He attended Serbian and Italian primary schools in Vranovići and Kotor. In 1865, he took his monastic vows in the Savina monastery near Herceg Novi. He was ordained a deacon by Bishop Stevan Knežević on 27 June 1865, and a presbyter on 2 October 1866. He became the nastojatelj (Serbian: настојатељ or nastojatelj) of Podlastva monastery in 1867, and of Morača monastery in 1869. From 7 September 1870 he was the hegumen (игуман or iguman) of the latter. Both a nastojatelj and an iguman are the senior monk in a monastery; the difference is so slight they are sometimes considered synonyms.

He participated in the war against the Ottoman Empire from 1876 to 1878, for which Prince Nikola decorated him with the Medal of Obilić. He was ordained a Metropolitan on 18 April 1885 in Saint Petersburg. The ceremony was conducted in Saint Isaac's Cathedral by Metropolitan Isidor of St. Petersburg and other members of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, in the presence of Tsar Alexander III of the Russian Empire. Soon after, on 5 September 1884, the relics of Saint Arsenius (the second Serb archbishop) were ceremonially transferred from the Ždrebaonik monastery in Bjelopavlići to the Kosijerevo monastery.

After 1906, he was a member of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Montenegro. He stayed in the country during the First World War occupation of the Kingdom by Austria-Hungary, and died on 30 September 1920, not long after the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and the reunification of the Serbian Orthodox Church, including the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral.

Quotes 
During the First World War, when Austria-Hungary occupied the Kingdom of Montenegro, the occupying troops razed the chapel at the peak of Mount Lovćen and exhumed the remains of Petar II Petrović-Njegoš. At that time, Mitrofan Ban said to Governor Weber: ""Njegoš was not just the ruler of Montenegro, but also a poet of Serbdom, and that act will mournfully echo in all Serbian lands"".

Life and work
Shmuel Yitzchak (English: Samuel Isaac) Hillman was born in Kovno, Lithuania, the son of Paya Rivka and Avraham Chaim Hillman. In his youth, he studied Torah under his uncles, Rabbi Mordechai Hillman, av beth din of Pasvatin, and Rabbi Noach Yaakov Hillman of Pasval. After his marriage, he studied intensively by himself in the house of his father-in-law, Rabbi Yitzchak Hirsch in the town of Franks in Kurland.

Rabbi Hillman received semicha from the famous Rabbis Eliyahu Dovid Teumim (who was the chief rabbi in Ponevezh and afterwards served in Jerusalem), Refael Shapiro of Volozhin, Meir Simcha HaKohen of Dvinsk and the Ridvaz of Slutsk.

In 1897, when Rabbi Hillman was 29 years old, he became rabbi and head of the Beth Din of Berazino in the Minsk Region of then-Russia, an old and distinguished community that had been graced with many great rabbis in the past. In 1908, he was appointed rabbi in Glasgow, serving and founding the Beth Din there until 1914, when he was appointed a dayan of the London Beth Din.

After retiring from the London Beth Din in 1934, Dayan Hillman settled in Jerusalem, devoting himself to study and writing. He co-founded the Jerusalem yeshiva Ohel Torah together with his son-in-law Chief Rabbi of Israel Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, and served as its rosh yeshiva.

His grandson was Israeli President Chaim Herzog, and his great-grandson is politician Isaac Herzog.

Lineage
Rabbi Hillman was a descendant of his namesake Rabbi Shmuel Hillman (Helman), the Av Beth Din of Metz, who is mentioned in the introduction to the responsa Noda Bihudah. On his mother's side, he was a descendant of Rabbi Michal Datnover, who was known in his time as an exceptional scholar and Kabbalist. His mother, Faya Hillman, moved to Hebron after the death of her husband. She survived the 1929 Hebron massacre by laying still amid the bodies of victims. A photograph of her laying wounded in a hospital bed appears in the book TARPAT Hebron with the caption ""Faya Hillman, mother of the rabbi from London."" Both she and her son were mentioned by descendant President Isaac Herzog during a Hanukkah candle lighting ceremony.

In addition, Rabbi Hillman was a direct sixth-generation descendant of the author of Knesses Yechezkel, who was the Av Beth Din of Altona, Hamburg and Wandsbek. He also descended from the Katzenellenbogen family, and could trace his lineage back to the Maharam (Rabbi Meir ben Isaac) of Padua and Rabbi Yehuda Mintz.

Death
Rabbi Hillman died in Jerusalem in 1953. Thousands of people followed his funeral through the streets of Jerusalem, among them Cabinet ministers, Members of the Knesset, and leading rabbis and rosh yeshivas. Dayan Hillman's death caused deep sorrow in Jerusalem, where he was greatly beloved.

Eulogies were delivered by the deceased's son-in-law Chief Rabbi Herzog, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer (with whom Dayan Hillman learned with in the Volozhin yeshiva), the Minister of Religious Affairs Mr Moshe Shapira, and others. He was survived by his wife; his daughter Sarah, the wife of Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog; and his son David Hillman, a London artist.

Soon after Dayan Hillman died, a memorial service was held in London, where Chief Rabbi Israel Brodie and Dayan Yehezkel Abramsky spoke, full of praise, respect and admiration for the deceased. Dayan Lazarus, Dayan Grunfeld, Dayan Grossnass and Rabbi Isidore Epstein were among those in attendance.

Works
Dayan Hillman authored many scholarly works, including a 20-volume commentary on every tractate of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, as well as on the Mishnaic Orders Zeraim and Taharos and on the Rambam and Sifra, entitled Or Hayashar (London, Jerusalem). He also published novellae on the Tanakh and a book of his sermons and orations.

Among the other writings of this outstanding figure were manuscripts on the Talmudic tractates Zevachim, Arakhin and Temura—all in the Order of Kodshim—and responsa on all four sections of the Shulchan Aruch.

479,55540058,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esculentin-2CHa,Esculentin-2CHa,"Esculentin-2CHa (from Latin ēsculentus (“edible; nutritious; full of food”)) is an antimicrobial peptide located outside the epithelial cell's membrane of the skin of many species of amphibians, such as Rana chiricahuensis. This peptide has recently become more important due to its defense response function and its possible application in the treatment of various human pathologies, that range from type 2 diabetes to bacterial and fungi infections.
Esculentin-2CHa is a peptide that belongs to the Esculentin-2 family, which is known for its broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity and its low cytotoxicity to human erythrocytes. However, not much is known about its structures and their relation to the functions these peptides carry out.

(*) The molar extinction is calculated by the number of tyrosines (Y), and the number of disulfide bonding pairs (cystines). Then the following formula is used to calculate the first extinction coefficient: W*5500 + Y*1490 + cystines*125. This calculation assumes that all cysteines pair into cystines. The second version assumes that all cysteines are reduced and there are no cystines, thus it is calculated as W*5500 + Y*1490.

Origin 

Esculentin-2CHa is a cytotoxic peptide with potent antibacterial and antifungal activity that can be found in the skin secretions from many species of Anura (frogs and toads). These kind of secretions include a wide variety of components of great importance due to their applications at anti-infective and anti-cancer drugs development.

Frogs from family Ranidae, also known as ""the true frogs"", are one of the richest sources of esculentin-2CHa and hundreds of other antimicrobial peptides. The 347 currently recognised species that compose the family Ranidae are widely distributed around the world. Esculentin-2 was removed for the first time from the skin of the frog Rana esculenta, native to Eurasia. Peptides with similar structure have also been identified in other Eurasian and North American species.

Esculentin-2CHa was particularly found at the secretions of the Chiricahua leopard frog Lithobates chiricahuensis, endemic to Mexico, Arizona and New Mexico (USA).

Structure

Primary structure 
Esculentin-2CHa is constituted by thirty-seven amino acids. These amino acids have different characteristics;  some are aliphatic and hydrophobic like Alanine and Leucine. Others, for example Phenylalanine, are aromatic and hydrophobic; therefore, they repel water. There are also positively charged amino acids (Arginine and Lysine) and a negatively charged one (Aspartic acid). The rest are polar compounds with no charge (Serine, Cysteine and Glutamine).

Secondary structure 

Esculentin's secondary structure follows an alpha-helical model, specifically in the central to the C-terminal region (residues 17-33) of the peptide. This conformation is the one that has the most probability based on the helix/coli transition theory.
There are different modifications of the peptide that have been studied, for instance, the deletion or replacement of Cys31 and Cys37 of the cyclic domain at the C-terminus region by the isosteric l-serine . This change causes a decrease of the helicity of the analog.

On the other hand, there are some fragments that maintain the extended-helical conformation and others that don't, when domains from the N-terminus of the peptide are removed. Though these analogs preserve the hydrophobicity and cationicity characteristic of esculentin-2CHa.

Other analogs that were studied had a helical form shorter than the original peptide and a higher charge at pH=7 (+9), when Asp20 and Asp27 residues were replaced by l-lysine.

Tertiary structure 
Due to the recent discovery of this peptide, there's not enough information about its third and fourth structure.

Function 
The principal functions, and the ones esculentin-2CHa is very remarkable for are:
 Antibacterial and antifungal activity
 Permeabilization of mammalian cells by interacting with the cell's membrane in a non-specific way
 Toxicity against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells
 Decrease of glucagon and plasma GLP-1
Esculentin-2CHa shows a potent growth-inhibitory activity against some of the reference strains of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia Coli, and multi-drug resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus. That is why this peptide is a candidate for anti-infective drug development.

In addition to that, it has been demonstrated that thanks to esculentin-2CHa mouse lymphoid cells stimulate the production of interleukin-10. Interleukin-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that contributes to the homeostatic maintenance of the organism by controlling the host immune response to pathogens. Even though esculentin-2CHa exhibits high cytotoxicity against human non-small lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, it presents a low profile of toxicity towards human erythrocytes.

Biological applications 
Some emerging strains of pathogenic bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics that are commonly used. Similarly, tumors can become unresponsive to chemotherapy. This resistance to multidrug treatments raised interest in finding new drugs that were capable of fighting these bacteria and tumors in a way that does not harm significantly the well functioning human cells.

That is why esculentin-2CHa, as a peptide with antibacterial and anticancer activity, and a low profile of toxicity against human erythrocytes, is a candidate for anti-infective drug development.

A use of this peptide has also been linked to the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Esculentin-2CHa for type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 

It has been shown that esculentin-2CHa administration in NIH Swiss mice following a high-fat diet reduced their body weight and blood glucose levels as well as insulin sensitivity by decreasing the glucagon and the plasma GLP-1, parameters that were increased due to the high fat diet. These studies lead to the hypothesis that esculentin-2-CHa could be a very interesting drug to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The treatment with this peptide did not show negative effects such as alteration of the bone mineral density or a liver dysfunction, which would have indicated toxicity.

Furthermore, Esculentin-2CHa helps to promote beta cell proliferation and their survival. This fact is very important because such type of cells, which can be found in the pancreas, are responsible for the storage and release of the insulin hormone.

It has been reported that esculentin-2CHa commands direct stimulatory actions on beta cells, implying peptide incorporation, KATP-independent membrane depolarization and incrementation of intracellular Ca+2, that ends up in the insulin hormone exocytosis. Therefore, esculentin-2CHa promotes the secretion of insulin to the blood, helping to reduce the glucose concentration in this tissue.

492,9747803,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle%20C%20Ranch,Circle C Ranch,"Circle C Ranch (also known as Circle C) is a large master-planned community in southwest Austin, Texas, USA. Development of Circle C Ranch began in 1982, with the first homes in the community in built in 1986. During development, the subdivision was featured prominently in a long and contentious environmental legal battle regarding urban development in the vicinity of Barton Springs and over Edwards Aquifer. The controversy surrounding its development and later annexation by the city of Austin was a landmark in municipal annexation rights in Texas.

Today, Circle C Ranch includes more than 5,614 homes. Amenities include an 18-hole golf course called the Grey Rock Golf Club, tennis club, four swim centers, a fire station, and more than  of dedicated parkland. The Circle C Swim Center has a year-round, outdoor, Olympic-size heated pool.  A second, family-oriented swimming pool complex, with adjacent office space and meeting rooms, was finished at the end of January 2012. The third pool, found in the Avaña section of Circle C, was built in 2014 and opened in 2015. The fourth pool, located in the GreyRock section of Circle C, opened in 2017.

History

Development of Circle C Ranch began in 1982 when Gary Bradley, at the time a part-owner of the Schlotzsky's restaurant chain, and his development partners began to earn development permits and acquire land in southwest Austin, Texas. However, several local environmentalist groups including the Save Our Springs Alliance (SOS) were strongly opposed to the development due to the subdivision's planned location over the recharge zone of the Edwards Aquifer. Despite the strong opposition, the first homes in Circle C were built in 1986. In 1988, the Save Barton Creek Association filed a lawsuit against the Texas Highway Department in order to stop the extension of Texas State Highway Loop 1 into southwest Austin and to halt further development of Circle C Ranch. However, the subdivision's homeowner association was able to defend its rights to the land, and thus development continued.

By 1990, Circle C Ranch was considered the top selling subdivision in Central Texas. However, in the same year, the Gibraltar Savings and Loan bank based in California failed to pay off its debts, and all of its assets were transferred; at the time, this was one of the largest insolvencies in American history. Since the savings and loan company was the source for much of the money and resources involved in the development of Circle C Ranch, the subdivision went bankrupt and entered Chapter 11 reorganization status; reorganization was completed in 1992. Over the following years, several ordinances and lawsuits were filed in relation to Circle C Ranch and its environmental implications, resulting in the creation of the Southwest Travis County Water and Reclamation District in 1996 and the Slaughter Creek Water Protection Zone the following year. However, both the water district and protection zone were found unconstitutional because they were located within the City of Austin's extraterritorial jurisdiction and conflicted with the City's powers. On December 18, 1997, Circle C Ranch was involuntarily annexed by the City of Austin after roughly 15 years of development.

493,2623689,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk%20jacket,Norfolk jacket,"A Norfolk jacket is a loose, belted, single-breasted tweed jacket with box pleats on the back and front, with a belt or half-belt. It was originally designed as a shooting coat that did not bind when the elbow was raised to fire. Its origin is uncertain but it may have been named after Coke of Norfolk, the Duke of Norfolk, or after the county of Norfolk. It was made fashionable after the 1860s in the sporting circle of the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, whose country residence was Sandringham House in Norfolk. The style was long popular for boys' jackets and suits, and is still used in some (primarily military and police) uniforms.

History
There have been several theories regarding the origin of the Norfolk jacket, although none are supported by much evidence. The first theory is that the jacket originated with Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, who invented it for use as a hunting coat in the late 1860s. According to this theory, the jacket was then discovered by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), whose country residence was at Sandringham House in Norfolk, and was made popular by him in the 1880s. No pictures of the prince in such a garment exist, however. Another theory is that the jacket was invented by Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (1754–1842), known as Coke of Norfolk, who regularly hosted guests such as the then Prince of Wales (the future George IV) for duck-shooting events at his estate in Holkham, Norfolk. It is also possible that there is no specific origin story, and the jacket was named as such simply because it was invented in the county of Norfolk.

The jacket has been modified several times since its invention, and its original form is now unknown. A version popularised in the 1930s consisted of a larger version of a sportscoat, together with a belt.

Types
There are many types of Norfolk jacket, with variations including the type of pleat used, and the style of the belt. Popular varieties today include the full Norfolk jacket, which features three or four buttons in a single-breasted layout, with pleats and a full belt; and the half Norfolk jacket which is less pleated and has only a half belt. Both these types have a notched lapel and a patch pocket. The Norfolk suit is an attire in which a Norfolk jacket is combined with matching trousers to form a full suit. This style was popular in the 1930s and 1940s but is rare today.

Uses
The Norfolk jacket has been employed in the military in the past, for example in the Australian Armed Forces in 1916, in which the women's uniform featured a Norfolk jacket combined with a felt hat, and by the North-West Mounted Police in Canada in the 1870s. It was also popularised in the Sears Catalog as a boy's garment in the early twentieth century, alongside the ""Buster Brown"" suit.

According to a descendant, John and his brother James Marlin emigrated from Ireland, while genealogists state he was born in Madison County, Alabama. He came to Texas in 1832 and settled near Sarahville de Viesca, Texas, in Robertson's Colony. 

John was granted a league of land (4,428 acres) east of the Brazos River in 1835 and started a settlement later honored on his behalf years after his death. Marlin's son-in-law, Samuel Blain, laid out the streets and lots of the town.

John Marlin's wife was Mary Menefee Marlin (1789–1845), whom he married in Tennessee in 1817. The family left because of violent clashes with the Native Americans, but John and Mary returned to Bucksnort by 1837, near Fort Milam, along with the George Morgan family. There was a massacre in January 1839 that left several of the Morgans dead.

John and Mary Marlin had seven children:

496,13039880,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimiro%20Roca,Vladimiro Roca,"Vladimiro Roca Antúnez (born 21 December 1942, in Havana) is a Cuban dissident and leader of the illegal Cuban Social-Democratic Party. A member of the ""Group of Four"", he was imprisoned from 1997 to 2002 after co-authoring a paper calling for democratic reforms.

Early life
Roca is the son of Blas Roca Calderio, one of the founders of the Communist Party of Cuba. In 1961, at the age of 18, he was among the first batch of a young elite selected for training as fighter pilots in the Soviet Union. He served for ten years in the Cuban Armed Forces, and subsequently worked as an economist for the government. He became an active dissident in 1991, four years after his father's death. Roca and his father were close, though the son never had the same enthusiasm for Fidel Castro's 1959 socialist revolution. He was then fired from his state job.

The Group of Four 
In August 1996, he linked up with three other Cuban professionals who favored change, economist Marta Beatriz Roque, engineer Félix Bonne Carcassés and attorney René Gómez Manzano to form the Working Group for Internal Dissidence. They then published a paper titled ""The Homeland Belongs to All,"" which discussed Cuba's human rights situation and called for political and economic reforms. They also called for a boycott of elections in Cuba's one-party system and for investors to avoid Cuba, giving several news conferences to discuss their concerns. A The Los Angeles Times columnist described Roca and Bonne's criticism carrying extra weight as ""the only known black dissidents in Cuba"", stating that ""Given Castro's claim that the revolution has ended racial discrimination, he can ill afford to let well-educated blacks challenge him, even as gently as the four defendants had done.""

Roca and the other members of the group were arrested on 16 July 1997. The four were detained for nineteen months and then tried for sedition in March 1999 in a one-day trial closed to foreign press. Roca was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The defendants became known as the ""Group of Four"". The US, EU, Canada, and the Vatican all called for his release. Amnesty International declared the four prisoners of conscience, ""detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association"", and called for their immediate release.

Roque, Bonne and Gómez were released in May 2000, but Roca was held for an additional two years. The Human Rights Committee of the US National Academy of Sciences speculated that he was ""singled out for particularly severe treatment because he had been a member of the Cuban Communist Party and his father had been one of its founding members"".

Roca entered prison an atheist, but was baptised Roman Catholic on 24 September 1999. He credited his new faith with helping him endure imprisonment. He was released from prison on 6 May 2002, 70 days before his five-year-sentence would have expired. CNN described the early release as ""apparently a conciliatory gesture"" by Castro ahead of a visit by former US president Jimmy Carter. Roca told reporters, ""I plan to continue working like I was before being arrested ... to continue the struggle because I believe I will see a change in Cuba before too long."" Roca met with Carter a week after his release.

Later activism 
In March 2003, Roca, Roque, and Elizardo Sanchez lobbied the European Union not to sign a trade agreement with Cuba. Roca stated that ""we do not believe a country with such a black human rights record should be allowed to join"". Roca also criticized the EU's 2008 lifting of sanctions against Cuba, accusing leaders of pushing the measure through against the popular will.

In May 2005, Roca and Roque organized a meeting of 200 dissidents which, unusually, was not interrupted by police. Roque described it as ""the first such gathering in Fidel Castro's 46 years of communist rule"" and ""a point of departure"" for further discussion.

Recognition 
In 2002, he won the Civil Courage Prize, which recognizes ""steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk — rather than military valor.""

Family 
He is married to Magaly de Armas, and they have a son and a daughter.

Raymond House was erected in 1897 in response to the popularity of Strong House, and was promptly designed by Francis R. Allen.  Named after the second president of Vassar College, John Howard Raymond, this dormitory has five floors and is one of the residence halls that was paid for by the college in entirety.

History
Due to the immense success of Strong House, built just four years prior, Raymond House was erected in 1897. The dormitory was built at the same time as the nearby Rockefeller Hall. Unlike Strong and Davison Houses, which were funded by money donated to the college by trustee John D. Rockefeller, Raymond was paid for completely by Vassar College.  Raymond was the third dormitory built on campus and was named after Vassar's second president, John Howard Raymond.  The first cooperative living plan that the college ever offered was in Raymond from its construction until the 1942-1943 academic year.  A $115 deduction in annual bill was given to students living in Raymond in exchange for performing housekeeping duties throughout the year.

Architecture and features
Designed by architect Francis R. Allen, Raymond House is the second of Vassar's five quadrangle dormitories.  The red brick dormitory has five floors above ground, as well as a basement.  There are two main entrances to the building, one on the east to the quadrangle, and one on the west to the road. The building's name, Raymond House, is inscribed over the dormitory's entrance.  The staircase to the west entrance was entirely rebuilt in 2005. The roof of Raymond is made of green slate, and the building contains six chimneys; each with two wythes, or internal flues, of brick and with bluestone caps.

Raymond has a current capacity of 200 students.

500,6812240,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councils%20of%20Sens,Councils of Sens,"The Councils of Sens were a number of church councils hosted by the Archdiocese of Sens.

The first, around 600 or 601, in conformity with the instructions of pope St. Gregory the Great advised against simony. St. Columbanus refused to attend it because the question of the date of Easter (which was to be decided) was dividing Franks and Bretons.

A series of councils (most concerned with the privileges of the Abbey of St. Pierre-le-Vif) were held in 657, 669 (or 670), 846, 850, 852, 853, 862, 980, 986, 996, 1048, 1071 and 1080.

The council of 1140, according to the letter issued by Archbishop Henri Sanglier, seems to have had no object but to impart solemnity to the exposition of the relics with which he enriched the cathedral.  The chief work of this council (which included representatives from the Ecclesiastical provinces of Sens and Reims and at which Saint Bernard of Clairvaux assisted) was the condemnation of Abelard's doctrine. Abelard appealed from the council to Rome, but the bishops of both provinces insisted in two letters to Innocent II that the condemnation be confirmed. Martin Deutsch dates this council to 1141 but the Abbé Vacandard attempted to prove by the letter from Peter the Venerable to Héloïse, the ""Continuatio Praemonstratensis"", the ""Continuatio Valcellensis"" and the list of the priors of Clairvaux that Baronius' date (1140) is correct. However, Constant Mews has convincingly argued in a revised examination of all the available sources that it did in fact take place in 1141.

The council of 1198 was concerned with the Manichaean sect of Poplicani which had spread throughout the Nivernais region, to which the dean of Nevers and the Abbot of St-Martin de Nevers were said to have belonged. After the council, Pope Innocent III ordered his papal legate Peter of Capua and the Bishop of Paris Eudes de Sully to investigate.

A council was held in 1224 to condemn a book by Scotus Eriugena.

Councils were also held in 1216, 1239, 1252, 1253, 1269, 1280, 1315, 1320, 1460 and 1485 (most for disciplinary reasons).

A synod was held in March 1522, called by Francis I of France, to discuss the reformation of the church and of the church taxes, also published in the 1520 book Taxe cancellarie apostolice. It had no concrete outcome.

502,49953907,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernanda%20Andrade,Fernanda Andrade,"Fernanda Andrade (born 8 March 1984) is a Brazilian-American actress and model. She is best known for the 2012 horror film, The Devil Inside, as well as the 2006 television miniseries, Fallen.

Biography
Andrade was born in São José dos Campos, São Paulo state, but raised in Campinas. Her mother is of Italian and Spanish descent, while her father's ancestry is Portuguese, Spanish, Swiss, and, possibly, Native Brazilian.

Her father was an engineer who traveled frequently. She moved with her family to the U.S. state of Florida when she was 11-years old when her father accepted a permanent engineering position. The move to the United States proved difficult at first, as her father was the only family member who spoke English at the time.

Career 

Andrade became interested in acting and film during high school. She was cast in her first professional role when she was 15 years old, when she appeared in the 2000 HBO biopic, For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story, which starred Andy García as the Cuban jazz musician, Arturo Sandoval. Andrade played Paloma, Sandoval's daughter-in-law, in the television film.

Andrade moved from Florida to Los Angeles when her agent relocated to Southern California. She appeared in several short films and television series during the 2000s and 2010s, including guest spots on CSI: NY and Law & Order: Los Angeles. In 2006, she starred in the ABC Family miniseries, Fallen.

In 2011, she was cast in a recurring role in season four of Sons of Anarchy.

She remained a relatively unknown actress until the debut of her 2012 horror film, The Devil Inside. The film, which stars Andrade, Simon Quarterman, Evan Helmuth, and Suzan Crowley, was produced on a shoe-string budget, but debuted in January 2012 with $34.5 million to win its opening weekend.

In 2016, she was cast as Christina Santos in the pilot episode of the Marvel's Most Wanted, but the series was not picked up by ABC.

In 2020, she starred in the FOX sci-fi action thriller NEXT opposite John Slattery.

Personal life
Andrade, who lives in California, is a vegetarian.

Andrade married musician Josh James in August 2017 in a ceremony in Pala, California.

503,18721564,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Palmer%20Residence,William Palmer Residence,"The William and Mary Palmer House is a house in Ann Arbor, Michigan, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1952. The home was designed for William Palmer, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, and his wife Mary. It sits on three lots at the end of a quiet, dirt road cul-de-sac. The location is near the Nichols Arboretum, and less than a mile (1.2 km) from the university.

History
William Palmer was born in Imlay City, Michigan, and studied economics at the University of Michigan; in 1930 he became a professor at the school. Mary Warton Shuford was born in North Carolina and enrolled in the University of Michigan's School of Music in 1935. She graduated in 1937 and married William Palmer. The couple purchased this property in 1949 and began seeking an architect to build their home.  After seeing the Affleck house in Bloomfield Hills, they contacted Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright designed the house in 1950.

The house was continuously owned by the Palmer family from 1951 to 2009. It was placed on the market in early August 2008, with restrictions in place.  Jeffrey and Kathryn Schox purchased the house in March 2009. Jeffrey Schox, who is a San Francisco patent attorney, spends several weeks a year in Ann Arbor. When he is not in Ann Arbor, the Palmer House will be available for rent as a guest house and as a meeting location.

Description
The Palmer house is a 2,000 square-foot Usonian home. It is located in a hillside and constructed of red cypress and brick. The house has a triangular geometry, with no right angles in the structure. There is a central entryway with three wings extend off from that: a bedroom wing to on side, a living room and terrace wing to the other, and a smaller carport perpendicularly. The hipped roof is long and dramatic, with a low slope and wide overhangs extending over each wings; it is clad with cedar shingles and copper.

A small garden house to the rear contains a collection of Wright-designed furniture.

505,7717646,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean%20Benedetti,Dean Benedetti,"Dean Benedetti (born Dino Alipio Benedetti, June 28, 1922 - January 20, 1957) was a saxophone player known for the amateur live recordings he made of fellow saxophonist Charlie Parker.

Biography
As a tenor saxophonist and band leader in California, Benedetti first heard a record of Parker in the Spring of 1945. Deeply influenced by the what he heard, Benedetti began to study Parker, transcribing solos, building them into set pieces, and working bop into his own playing.

A two-week engagement at Los Angeles's Hi-De-Ho Club in early 1947, recorded on discs, was the start of Benedetti's pursuit of Parker. In 1948, Benedetti headed to New York with bandmate Jimmy Knepper, and recorded Charlie Parker on March 31, and July 7, both of these on a Sears tape recorder.

While in New York, Benedetti began to use heroin. Unable to break into the New York music scene, he returned to his parents home in California in 1948. Trying to finance their way back to the East coast, Benedetti and Knepper attempted to sell drugs. However, Knepper took the drugs with him back to LA and abandoned Benedetti in New York.

Shortly after returning to California, Benedetti discovered he had a rare muscle disease, Myasthenia Gravis. The disease affected his playing, and he soon quit performing in public. The disease ruined his health, and in 1953 he moved in with his parents in Italy. He died on January 20, 1957, at the age of 34.

Issue of Parker recordings
The jazz historian Phil Schaap in a 2008 New Yorker article described the Benedetti recordings of Parker's performances as existing for many years as a jazz legend (they were long elusive) similar to the myth of an undiscovered  Buddy Bolden cylinder. One of Parker's record producers Ross Russell of the Dial label, in his novel The Sound (1961) wrote of a failed musician he called Royo who recorded Parker and supplied him with heroin and alcohol. In his unreliable Parker biography Bird Lives! (1973), Russell used Benedetti's real name, but repeated his fictionalized assertions, and inaccurately claimed Benedetti recorded Parker without approval.

Benedetti's surviving brother Rigoletto ""Rick"" Benedetti contacted Michael Cuscuna of Mosaic Records and informed Cuscuna the acetate discs and tapes existed. Purchased by Mosaic for $15,000, Benedetti's archive comprised 53 78-rpm acetate discs and 14 reels of paper-based tape. Produced by Phil Schaap and Bob Porter, the set took three years to assemble. Benedetti's paper-backed tapes had dried out and were in a fragile state. Schaap used Wite-Out, a brand of correction fluid, on the reverse of the tapes (where necessary) to strengthen them. Initially the tapes, reportedly eight miles in total length, could not be played without breaking.

The Complete Dean Benedetti Recordings of Charlie Parker, a 10 LP or 7 CD box-set, was released by Mosaic in 1990. Leonard Feather wrote in the Los Angeles Times that ""the sound quality inevitably is pre-digital, pre-stereo, prehistoric"", but wrote the set ""can be recommended unreservedly to Bird-lorists for selective, non-continuous listening."" By 2008, Mosaic had sold 5,000 copies of the box-set.

Description

It is a high-powered, light-weight vehicle with high acceleration for short- and medium-distance services with frequent stops. The aluminium superstructure was built as flat as possible, both to minimize drag and to ease automated cleaning.

History 

Chiba Institute of Technology began as . The meaning of Kōa means that Asia wakes up. Japanese government issued a permission of the establishment on December 7, 1941(December 8 Asia time). Kōa Institute of Technology was founded by  Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, Osami Nagano, Kuniyoshi Obara, Minoru Tōgō, Kotaro Honda, Hidetsugu Yagi, Shigenao Konishi, Yuzuru Hiraga, Nobuteru Mori (Mori Konzern founder･See also Shōwa Denkō), Satoru Mori (Son Nobuteru Mori), Kitaro Nishida, Shunpei Honma, Tokutomi Sohō, Saneatsu Mushanokōji in 1942.Also, Kunihiko Hashida is involved as a representative of the Government of Japan.

The college was founded as a national policy for the rise of Asia tech. The purpose of the construction of the college was a contribution to the world culture and dissemination of engineering education to the people of Asia.

Kōa Institute of Technology took full-scale support from University of Tokyo, Tohoku University, Tokyo Institute of Technology as an educational institution to bring up the engineers who would lead a nation. Department of Industrial Engineering and materials management courses, aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering has been installed at the university.

In 1944, the headquarters of the university was moved to  Sophia University  in Kōjimachi  from Tamagawa Gakuen. The metallurgy course work was relocated to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries factory yard in　Kawasaki, Kanagawa in September.

The Kōjimachi and Kawasaki campus were destroyed during the April 13, 1945 and May 25 Tokyo air raids in World War II. The college was consigned to a class in the Tokyo Institute of Technology until 1946.

The college changed its name to Chiba Institute of Technology in 1946 and moved to the Kimitu campus. Four years later, it was moved to the present location.

On the educational philosophy of CIT  
 / Wikisource|興亞工業大學設立趣意書 
CIT was created as a base for the Asian cultural sphere to contribute to world culture. The educational goal of the university is to train engineers who contribute to world culture. Many Japanese universities offer education based on the traditional European educational philosophy, but CIT provides personnel education based on the Asian philosophy based on the Kitaro Nishida philosophy. Education at CIT is based on the policy of Progressive education from the very beginning, cherishing liberalism and individuality respect.

512,38859978,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland%20%28TV%20series%29,Shetland (TV series),"Shetland is a British crime drama television series, made by ITV Studios for BBC Scotland and first broadcast on BBC One 10 March 2013.  Initially based upon the novels of Ann Cleeves, the series was brought to the screen by David Kane, who has remained a principal writer throughout the series.

The series stars Douglas Henshall as Jimmy Pérez, a detective inspector working for the Scottish police, Alison O'Donnell as Detective Sergeant Alison ""Tosh"" Macintosh, and Steven Robertson as Detective Constable Sandy Wilson. Mark Bonnar, Lewis Howden, Erin Armstrong, Julie Graham, and Anne Kidd are also principal members of the cast.

The story takes place largely on the eponymous Scottish archipelago, although some of the filming takes place on the Scottish mainland.  Most, but not all, exterior location filming takes place in Shetland; in 2021, filming of series 6 and 7 took place in Shetland in two segments, each of about six weeks’ duration. Interiors may be filmed in either Shetland or in west central Scotland.  Henshall won the 2016 BAFTA Scotland award for best actor and the series received the award for Best TV Drama.

On 2 December 2019, BBC One announced that Shetland would return for two further series intended for 2020 and 2021 with Henshall and O’Donnell returning in their roles. Production had to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19.  Six series have been broadcast as of November 2021. Series 6 broadcast began on 20 October 2021.

Production
The first series consists of two episodes, a single two-part story based on the novel Red Bones  by Ann Cleeves. This series was broadcast across two nights on 10 and 11 March 2013 and was produced by Sue de Beauvoir. Subsequently, a second series was commissioned by the BBC. Series two was extended to contain six episodes. These were filmed in 2013 and screened in 2014. This series features three two-part stories based on Cleeves' novels Raven Black, Dead Water, and Blue Lightning. This series was produced by Peter Gallagher.

Filming began in April 2015 for a third series, which began screening in January 2016. This series saw a change in format; with all six episodes covering a single story, written exclusively for television.  This was the first series not to adapt any of Cleeves' novels. Ciarán Hinds and Anna Chancellor were among the new cast members for this series. A fourth series was announced by the BBC in July 2016. Again, this series is a single story played out across six episodes and written exclusively for television. Stephen Walters and Neve McIntosh were among the new cast members announced for the series. It was broadcast on BBC One beginning on 13 February 2018.

In July 2018, Henshall confirmed that filming for series 5 would be over the following four months. Series 5 was broadcast was on BBC1 from 12 February 2019.

During filming, the cast and crew are usually based in Glasgow and other areas of mainland Scotland. Filming often takes place in areas with landscape or buildings reminiscent of those in the Shetland Islands, such as Kilbarchan in Renfrewshire, Barrhead, where Henshall was born and grew up, Ayr and Irvine, North Ayrshire. ""My character’s house is actually in Kilbarchan, the interior of a couple of crofts are here [in Irvine, Ayrshire] and the police station is in Barrhead"", Henshall said in a 2019 interview.

Filming locations on or near Shetland have included Lerwick, the main port of the Shetland Islands and on the NorthLink ferry approaching Lerwick as well as the village of Wester Quarff south of Lerwick. Some filming was done on Fair Isle for series 2 while the Hillswick wildlife sanctuary was featured in series 4.

I see, now, when I go to the wedding), 162, in Weimar for the 20th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it in 1715 or 1716.

History and words 
On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the  (palace church), on a monthly schedule. He wrote the cantata for the 20th Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Ephesians, ""walk circumspectly, ... filled with the Spirit"" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the great banquet (). The cantata text was provided by the court poet Salomon Franck, published in  (1715). He refers to the gospel and reflects how essential it is to follow the loving invitation of the Lord. Franck's language is rich in contrasts, such as  (poison for the soul and bread of heaven), and of images derived from the Bible, such as """" (Heaven is his throne) after Isaiah 66:1. The closing chorale is the seventh stanza of Johann Rosenmüller's hymn """" (1652).

Bach first performed the cantata on 3 November 1715 (according to the musicologist Alfred Dürr) or on 25 October 1716. Bach performed the cantata again on 10 October 1723 in his first year in Leipzig in a revised version, including a corno da tirarsi, a baroque wind instrument mentioned only in Bach's music and thought to have been similar to the slide trumpet (tromba da tirarsi). Bach's score is lost, and some parts seem to be missing as well.

Scoring and structure 
Bach structured the work in six movements. Like other cantatas written during this period in Weimar, it is scored for a small ensemble, four soloists, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of corno da tirarsi (likely added in Leipzig), two violins, viola, and basso continuo, including bassoon in movement 1. Only the chorale is set for four voices.

 Aria (bass): 
 Recitative (tenor): 
 Aria (soprano): 
 Recitative (alto): 
 Duet aria (alto, tenor): 
 Chorale:

Music 
The cantata opens with a bass aria in A minor, accompanied by three instruments in a polyphonic setting, the two violins and the viola (with the corno). The motif for the first words is present most of the time. The soprano aria seems to lack a part for an obbligato instrument. For the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage of the Monteverdi Choir (and John Eliot Gardiner), Robert Levin reconstructed a version for flauto traverso and oboe d'amore. The duet is also accompanied only by the continuo, but seems complete. The melody of the closing chorale is rare elsewhere, but appeared in Weimar not only in this work, but also in a chorale prelude of Johann Gottfried Walther.

515,52762557,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lygus%20rugulipennis,Lygus rugulipennis,"Lygus rugulipennis, common name European tarnished plant bug, is a species of plant bugs of the family Miridae.

Distribution and habitat
This common and widespread species is present in most of Europe and in the Nearctic realm. These bugs mainly occur in gardens and in areas with abundant vegetation.

Description

Lygus rugulipennis can reach a length of . These small plant bugs can be identified mainly on the basis of the fine details of the corium, that in this species is very pubescent, with the space among hairs less than the length of one hair. Legs are quite bristly and wings-tips are membranous. The color pattern and markings are quite variable, ranging from purple to yellowish brown. Usually the males are more strongly marked than females, that commonly vary from dark red to light reddish-brown. Lygus rugulipennis is quite similar to Lygus pratensis and Lygus maritimus.

Biology
These polyphagous bugs can be found on many plants. They may feed on Trifolium, Chenopodium, Rumex, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Urticaceae and Asteraceae species. They also feed on potatoes, cereals, alfalfa and other crops, so they are considered a very harmful pest. Adults are present all year, but they are more abundant in late summer. They usually winter in leaf litter.

516,2794161,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20Eminger,Steve Eminger,"Steve Eminger (born October 31, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL).

Playing career
Eminger, who is also known for his physical play, started his hockey career with the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League in 1999. He was drafted in the first round, 12th overall by the Washington Capitals at the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut the next season, but after 17 games in Washington he was sent back down to Kitchener. Kitchener was strengthened by Eminger's return, and they won the Memorial Cup.

Since leaving junior hockey, Eminger split his time between the Capitals and their AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates. Despite the lofty projections that came with his first-round-pick status, Eminger has failed to live up to expectations. Throughout the 2007–08 NHL season, the final season of his contract, Eminger spent a great deal of time as a healthy scratch. However, during the 2008 playoffs the Capitals were decimated by injuries and Eminger was put into the lineup with a larger role. During these playoffs, Eminger suddenly found his niche and proved himself to be a solid defenceman. During the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Eminger, along with the 84th overall pick (Jacob De Serres) were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for the 27th pick overall (John Carlson).

On June 29, 2008, Eminger and the Flyers agreed to a one-year contract. After 12 games with the Flyers, Eminger was traded to Tampa Bay on November 7, 2008, along with Steve Downie and a 4th round draft pick for Matt Carle and a 3rd round draft pick.

On March 9, 2009, on the day of the trade deadline, Tampa Bay traded Eminger to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Noah Welch and a 3rd round draft pick.

On September 4, 2009, Eminger was signed as a free agent by the Anaheim Ducks to a two-year deal.

On July 9, 2010, Eminger was traded to New York Rangers for Aaron Voros and Ryan Hillier. On September 10, 2012, Eminger agreed to a new contract to re-sign with the Rangers.

After spending his professional career entirely on North America soil, Eminger signed as a free agent to his first contract abroad with Russian club, CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League on October 21, 2014. After producing just 2 assists in 25 games, Eminger was released from his KHL contract and on January 24, 2014, Eminger joined the Norfolk Admirals after having cleared AHL wavers.

On September 5, 2014, the Boston Bruins announced that Eminger had signed a one-year contract with their AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. As a free agent in the summer and into the midpoint of the 2015-16 season, Eminger returned to play in signing a professional try-out contract with the Lake Erie Monsters of the AHL on January 21, 2016. Eminger ended his playing career after winning the Calder Cup with the Monsters during the 2015–16 season.

On June 14, 2017, Eminger was announced to have accepted a position as a professional scout for the New York Rangers.

Personal life
Eminger is married to Lindsay Eminger.

522,12142434,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eber-Nari,Eber-Nari,"Eber-Nari (Akkadian also Ebir-Nari, Abar-Nahara עבר-נהרה (Aramaic) or 'Ābēr Nahrā (Syriac) meaning ""Beyond the River"" or ""Across the River"" in both the Akkadian and Imperial Aramaic languages of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, i.e., the Western bank of the Euphrates from a Mesopotamian and Persian viewpoint), also referred to as Transeuphratia () by modern scholars, was a region of Western Asia and a satrapy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC), Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BC) and Achaemenid Empire (539–332 BC). The Akkadian Eber-Nari is referred to as Athura or Athuriya in Old Persian, and Aššur in the Elamite. The Targum Onkelos lists Nineveh, Calah, Reheboth, and Resen as being in the jurisdiction of Athura.

Name
 — i.e. the region west of the Euphrates.
 — i.e. the other side of the Euphrates.
 — i.e. beyond the river.

The province is also mentioned extensively in the Biblical books of Ezra and Nehemiah as עבר הנהר Evver Hanahar. Additionally, sharing the same root meaning, Eber (pronounced Evver) was also a character in the Hebrew Bible from which the term Hebrew was widely believed to have been derived (see: Eber), thus the Hebrews were inferred to have been the people who crossed into Canaan across the (Euphrates or the Jordan) river.

History

The term was established during the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC) in reference to its Levantine colonies, and the toponym appears in an inscription of the 7th century BC Assyrian king Esarhaddon. The region remained an integral part of the Assyrian empire until its fall in 612 BC, with some northern regions remaining in the hands of the remnants of the Assyrian army and administration until at least 605 BC, and possibly as late as 599 BC.

Subsequent to this Eber-Nari was fought over by the Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BC) and Egypt, the latter of which had entered the region in a belated attempt to aid its former Assyrian overlords. The Babylonians and their allies eventually defeated the Egyptians (and remnants of the Assyrian army) and assumed control of the region, which they continued to call Eber-Nari.

The Babylonians were overthrown by the Persian Achaemenid Empire (539–332 BC), and the Persians assumed control of the region. Having themselves spent centuries under Assyrian rule, the Achaemenid Persians retained the Imperial Aramaic and Imperial organisational structures of their Assyrian predecessors.

In 535 BC the Persian king Cyrus the Great organized some of the newly conquered territories of the former Neo-Babylonian Empire as a single satrapy; ""Babylonia and Eber-Nari"", encompassing southern Mesopotamia and the bulk of the Levant.  Northern Mesopotamia, the north east of modern Syria and south east Anatolia remaining as Athura (Assyria) (Achaemenid Assyria).

The satrap of Eber-Nari resided in Babylon and there were subgovernors in Eber-Nari, one of which was Tattenai, mentioned in both the Bible and Babylonian cuneiform documents. This organization remained untouched until at least 486 BC (Xerxes I's reign), but before c. 450 BC the ""mega-satrapy"" was split into two—Babylonia and Eber-Nari.

Herodotus' description of the Achaemenid tax district number V fits with Eber-Nari. It comprised Aramea, Phoenicia, and Cyprus (which was also included in the satrapy). Herodotus did not include in the tax list the Arabian tribes of the Arabian peninsula, identified with the Qedarites, that did not pay taxes but contributed with a tax-like gift of frankincense.

Eber-Nari was dissolved during the Greek Seleucid Empire (312–150 BC), the Greeks incorporating both this region and Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia into Seleucid Syria during the 3rd century BC. Syria was originally a 9th-century Indo-Anatolian derivation of Assyria and was used for centuries only in specific reference to Assyria and the Assyrians (see Name of Syria), a land which in modern terms actually encompassed only the northern half of Iraq, north east Syria and south east Turkey and not the bulk of Greco-Roman, Byzantine or modern nation of Syria. However, from this point the terms Syrian and Syriac were used generically and often without distinction to describe both Assyria proper and Eber-Nari/Aram, and their respective Assyrian and Aramean/Phoenician populations.

The compound is prepared by the condensation of two equivalents of acetylacetone and phosphine:
PH3  +  2 CH3C(O)CH2C(O)CH3   →   HP(CH3CCH2CCH3)2O3  +  H2O
The condensation is sometimes called the Buckler–Epstein reaction.  Many diketones can be employed in place of acetylacetone.  The P-H bond can be further derivitized, leading to a range of tertiary phosphines of potential value in homogeneous catalysis.

The contest usually lasts for six days: 3 contest days, 2 special event days and, at the end, the day where the contest's results are announced followed by an ending concert.

Location 

For the first 14 years New Wave was held in the Latvian coastal city of Jūrmala, but in 2015 it moved to Sochi, the Russian Federation (other potential locations included Baku, Kaliningrad, Kazan and Crimea). According to organizer Igor Krutoy, the main reason for relocating was performing Russian singers Valeriya, Iosif Kobzon and Oleg Gazmanov being denied entry into Latvia for the 2014 contest by Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgars Rinkēvičs because of their voiced support for Russia's annexation of Crimea.

Participants 

Although meant to popularize new stars from all over Europe, the countries of the former USSR and the USA, many present and former superstars play an important, if not the most important, role in it. Many participants have also represented their countries at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, including but not limited to: Helena Meraai (Belarus), Gaia Cauchi (Malta), Marta Kirakosyan (Armenia), Ela Mangion (Malta),  Daneliya Tuleshova (Kazakhstan), Krisia Todorova (Bulgaria), Lerika Engalycheva (Russia and Moldova), Anahit Adamyan (Armenia), Polina Bogusevich (Russia), Misha Gregoryan (Armenia), Anastasiya Baginska (Ukraine), Dino Jelusić (Croatia) and Daniel Yastremski (Belarus).

The three subclasses differed as follows:

In the 1920s, 699 H6a and H6b had superheaters added, and cylinder size increased from  to . These rebuilt units were reclassified to H6sa and H6sb.

Class H6 were used throughout the system as mainline freight haulers, on local freights, and as switchers in yards. They were frequently seen double- and tripleheading long freight trains up the steep grades on the Pennsy.

During the period when the PRR was building the H-6 class, the railroad had effective stock control of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and installed a PRR vice-president Leonor F. Loree, as president of the B&O. Subsequently, the B&O bought a large group of identical locomotives from the American Locomotive Company; these were initially classified class I-4, later becoming class E-24. The E-24 class had many variations, some being converted to switchers, or receiving superheaters and new valve chests.  The E-24a was equivalent to the PRR H-6sb.  None of the B&O E-24 class survived to the diesel era.

China
Around 1938, thirty H6sb were sold second-hand to the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), which designated them Sorisa (ソリサ) class (Sori, from ""Consolidation"", and sa, from san, ""three"", to indicate the third class of Consolidation-type locomotives operated by Mantetsu). To distinguish these from the British-made Sorisa 1−7, the H6sb were nicknamed ペンソリ Pensori (Pennsylvania Consolidation). Of these, fifteen were taken up by Mantetsu, which numbered them ソリサ8 through ソリサ22, whilst the other fifteen were assigned to the Manchukuo National Railway, where they were numbered ソリサ547 through ソリサ561.

After the end of the Pacific War, both Mantetsu and the Manchukuo National were absorbed by the China Railway, which designated them class KD10.

Survivors

PRR #2846, an H6sb built in 1905 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, has been preserved by the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania with two other examples of the H class. #2846 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as Consolidation Freight Locomotive No. 2846.

It is one of the busiest local bus routes in Queens. Operated by the North Shore Bus Company until 1947, the route is now operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations under the New York City Transit brand.

Route description and service
The Q17 begins at Archer Avenue and Merrick Boulevard at Jamaica Center in downtown Jamaica, just south of the 165th Street Bus Terminal. This terminus is shared with the Q20A/B and Q44 buses. The Q17 proceeds north along 168th Street to Hillside Avenue, then east along Hillside to 188th Street. The route continues north on 188th Street through Jamaica Estates and Utopia to the Long Island Expressway (LIE) at the Fresh Meadows shopping center. The segment on 188th Street between 73rd Avenue and the LIE is shared with the . Both routes turns west onto the LIE's service road, Horace Harding Expressway, until Kissena Boulevard, where the Q17 turns north. The Q88 continues along Horace Harding to Queens Center Mall. The Q17 proceeds north along Kissena, sharing the road with the Q25 and Q34 buses to Main Street in Downtown Flushing (also known as Flushing Chinatown). The Q17 alights its final passengers on 39th Avenue, at the Main Street subway station. Terminating Q17 and  buses proceed east along 39th Avenue, lay over on 138th Street, then return along 37th Avenue to pick up southbound passengers at Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue.

During weekday midday hours and weekday rush hours in the peak direction (AM to Flushing; PM to Jamaica), alternate southbound local service terminates at 188th Street and Horace Harding Expressway in Fresh Meadows. During weekday rush hours, bi-directional limited-stop service is operated along the full route between Jamaica and Flushing.

The original Q17 route ran along Homelawn Street, Utopia Parkway, and Fresh Meadow Lane between Hillside Avenue and Horace Harding, passing by St. John's University. This route is now covered by the  (formerly the Q17A) and the .

History

The Q17 was originally operated by the Flushing Heights Bus Company, which began operating circa 1928. In 1931, the New York City Board of Estimate was deciding which bus route franchises would be given to which private operators. Along with thirty other bus routes, the Q17 was tentatively assigned to the North Shore Bus Company, as part of Zone B (Flushing and Northern Queens).

The North Shore Bus Company acquired the franchises to the Flushing Heights Bus routes on September 22, 1935, but the two companies did not merge. As part of the transaction, North Shore expected to get the franchises for both the Q17 and  from the city. North Shore was only allowed to keep the Q17 route, and as compensation, the city assured them of a new route between Flushing and Jamaica via Main Street. This route would go into service when a bridge was built to carry Main Street over the Grand Central Parkway in 1938; this route is today's .

On July 1, 1939, the Q17 became interlined with the , meaning that north of Flushing the bus would continue via the Q20 route to College Point. The service was designated ""Q17-20"" or ""Q20-17"" and rollsigns would display Q17/20. On December 16, 1940, the Q17-20 route's southern terminal was moved from the 165th Street Bus Terminal to the intersection of 168th Street and Jamaica Avenue, three blocks east. The route been running to the 165th Street Terminal since North Shore took the terminal over in mid-1939. Beginning on June 8, 1942 due to restrictions on gasoline and tire usage during World War II, the service was truncated to 14th Avenue and 122nd Street in College Point. Service north of 14th Avenue was restored on February 4, 1946. The Q20 was separated from the Q17 during off-peak ""base period"" hours on January 27, 1947. In March of that year, North Shore Bus would be taken over by the New York City Board of Transportation (later the New York City Transit Authority), making the bus routes city operated. The joint Q17-20 service later became popular among students of St. John's University, and residents from Jamaica Estates and Flushing Heights (now Kew Gardens Hills) shopping in Downtown Flushing.

On February 3, 1957, the Transit Authority separated the Q17 and Q20 services at all times. By 1960, the Q17 was rerouted onto 188th Street between Jamaica and Fresh Meadows.

On December 11, 1988, when the Archer Avenue Line opened, the Q17's southern terminal was moved one block east and south to Archer Avenue and Merrick Boulevard. Limited-stop service during peak hours began on September 8, 2003. Limited-stop service was estimated to save riders traveling longer distances five minutes, and was provided by alternate Q17 trips. The locations of limited stops were made because they were in most case high volume transfer points, have high ridership and are spaced out to allow limited-stop service to run more quickly than local service. This change was announced in May 2003, and was presented to the NYC Transit Committee of the MTA Board on June 17, 2003. In August 2014, the northern layover area of the Q17 and Q27 was shifted from Prince Street west of Main Street near St. George's Church, to 39th Avenue and 138th Street east of Main Street.

On 2 February 1354, Robert of Namur married Isabella of Hainault (1323–1361), younger sister of Philippa of Hainault, queen consort of King Edward III of England. Thus Robert became brother-in-law to Edward III. Robert captured the Escanaffles Castle in 1363. Robert brought Jean Froissart to England, and introduced him to Queen Philippa. In 1369, Robert defended the English camp at Tournehem against French attack. He was made Knight of the Garter in 1369 after the death of Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk.

On 20 August 1371, Robert fought for Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg and Brabant, commanding 2,000 men at the Battle of Baesweiler, but was defeated and released after paying a ransom. In 1373, Jean Froissart completed his first book of the Chronicles and dedicated it to Robert of Namur.

Lewis (May 19, 1935 – December 2, 2020) was Professor Emeritus of Medicine and Community Health and the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Professor of Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University.

He was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the United States' National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. He served on the Executive Committee and was former Executive Director of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse, and was the founder and a member of the Board of Directors of Physicians and Lawyers for National Drug Policy.

Background
Lewis earned his bachelor's degree magna cum laude from Brown University in 1957 and his medical degree at Harvard University in 1961. He specialized in internal medicine and later in treatment of alcoholism and addiction to other drugs.

He entered the field of addictions while an internal medicine resident at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, where he collaborated with famed Harvard psychiatrist Norman Zinberg on seminal work on heroin addiction (Zinberg & Lewis, 1964; Lewis & Zinberg, 1964). He later served from 1963-1964 as a health policy advisor to Cleveland mayor Dennis Kucinich and became a leading advocate for legalization of heroin maintenance programs (Lewis, 1964). From 1972 through 1979 he directed the Washingtonian Center for Addictions. He became Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in 1975. In 1976 he joined the Brown University faculty as an Associate Professor of Medicine and director of the Program in Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. He was named the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Scholar in Alcoholism Studies at Brown University in 1979 and chaired the Department of Community Health from 1981 through 1986. In 1982, he founded the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies and was designated the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Professor of Alcohol and Addiction Studies as well as Professor of Medicine and Community Health. He directed the alcohol studies center for 18 years prior to his retirement. From 1990 through 1991 he was Scholar-in-Residence in the National Academy of Sciences-Institute of Medicine in Washington, DC.

In 1976, Lewis was one of the founders of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA). He served as President of AMERSA from 1983 through 1985 and became Executive Editor of AMERSA's peer-reviewed, quarterly journal Substance Abuse in 1984. From 1986 through 1995 he was director of AMERSA's National Office, which was located at Brown University.

Lewis and David Duncan, in a presentation at the 1996 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, proposed that an alliance of health professionals could best bring about major reform of America's national drug policies. In 1997, he convened a meeting of 37 of the nation's leading physicians which adopted a policy statement declaring the ""war on drugs"" to be a failed approach and calling for adoption of an approach to drug abuse based on prevention and treatment rather than law enforcement. The group of physician leaders incorporated as Physician Leadership on National Drug Policy (PLNDP), with Lewis as its Project Director from 1997 through 2003. In 2004, the organization expanded its membership to include a number of leaders of the legal profession and became Physicians and Lawyers for National Drug Policy. Dr. Lewis continued to serve on PLNDP's Board of Directors. Lewis has been a leading spokesperson for harm reduction (Lewis, Duncan & Clifford, 1997) and for the perspective that sees addiction as being a chronic disease like any other (Lewis, 1994; McLellan, Lewis, O'Brien, & Kleber, 2000).

In 1996 Lewis delivered the Norman E. Zinberg Memorial Lecture at Cambridge Hospital/Harvard Medical School. He received the American Medical Association's Education and Research Foundation Award in 1997 for outstanding contributions and leadership in championing the inclusion of alcohol and other drug problems into the mainstream of medical practice and medical education. He received the Distinguished Contributions in the Addictions award from Harvard Medical School in 2002, and in 2004 he received the John P. McGovern Award and Lectureship from the American Society of Addiction Medicine for his contributions to the treatment of addictive disorders.

Despite the fame, Lewis still loved teaching the best. He died on December 2, 2020, aged 85.

Plot
Hornby adapted the book for the screen and fictionalised the story, concentrating on Arsenal's First Division championship-winning season in 1988–89 and its effect on the protagonist's romantic relationship. Firth plays Paul Ashworth, the character based on Hornby, a teacher at a school in south Hertfordshire and his romance with Sarah Hughes (Ruth Gemmell), a new teacher who joins Ashworth's school. The film culminates with the real life events of Arsenal's match against title rivals Liverpool in the final game of the season on 26 May 1989, with a last-minute goal by Michael Thomas giving Arsenal the 2–0 win they needed to secure the title.

Production
The film also stars Neil Pearson as Paul's father and Mark Strong as Steve, Paul's best friend. Nick Hornby has a cameo as a beaten opposition manager in a school football match. Parts of the film were shot on location in the surroundings of Arsenal Stadium in Highbury; as the terracing at Highbury had since been replaced, the scenes of fans on the terraces were instead filmed at Fulham's Craven Cottage stadium.

Remake
In 2005, the film was remade in an American version also entitled Fever Pitch starring Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore, with the 2004 World Series Boston Red Sox replacing Arsenal.  To avoid confusion, this 2005 remake is known as The Perfect Catch in the UK.

Problems of immobility
As long as people have been bed-ridden through illness, they have fallen victim to the complications of immobility. These can include, but are not limited to:
Disorders of the skin and underlying tissue.
Pneumonia and other related respiratory illnesses.
Disorders of the renal and gastrointestinal systems.
Disruption in the cognitive systems resulting in neuro-psychological disorders.

Critically ill patients, unable to move spontaneously, are nursed in the supine position for extended periods of time. This is in striking contrast to normal human beings who, even during sleep, change their position approximately every 11.6 min–a phenomenon described by Keane as ""minimum physiological mobility requirement."" The deleterious effects of prolonged immobilization affect the heart, vascular system, musculoskeletal system, skin, and kidneys, despite the usual nursing practice of repositioning every two hours.

Traditional methods of dealing with immobility
The traditional method of dealing with immobility is to turn the patient at least every two hours, following a side-back-side protocol. Through the years, many mechanical systems have been improvised to prevent these complications of immobility:
Sheepskin laid on top of the patient's mattress.
Foam mattresses and overlays.
Non-powered and powered air mattresses

554,691048,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon%20Curt%20Noll,Landon Curt Noll,"Landon Curt Noll (born October 28, 1960) is an American computer scientist, co-discoverer of the 25th Mersenne prime and discoverer of the 26th, which he found while still enrolled at Hayward High School and concurrently at California State University, Hayward.

Biography
Noll was born in Walnut Creek, California, United States.  At age 18, he became the youngest person to break the record for the largest known prime.  He has held or co-held the record three times.
He is also the co-inventor (with John Horton Conway) of a system for naming arbitrarily large powers of 10.
He also helped start the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, and is a co-inventor of the Fowler Noll Vo hash function.

He was also a member of the Amdahl Six team (John S. Brown, Bodo Parady, Curt Landon Noll, Gene W. Smith, Joel F. Smith, and Sergio E. Zarantonello) which discovered another record prime in 1989; this prime remains unusual as a record large prime as it was not a Mersenne prime.

Noll is an amateur astronomer. His work includes measuring the Solar parallax during the 2004 Transit of Venus as well as the search for Vulcanoid asteroids.

He was also involved in politics as a Sunnyvale, California city council member and vice-mayor.

555,2461634,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua%20Girling%20Fitch,Joshua Girling Fitch,"Sir Joshua Girling Fitch (13 February 1824 – 14 July 1903) was an English educationist.

Life
Fitch was the second son of Thomas Fitch, of a Colchester family.
He was born in Southwark, London. 
The eldest son, Thomas Hodges (1822–1907), became a Roman Catholic and eventually was attached to the Marist Church, Notre Dame de France, in Leicester Square, London. 
The third son, William John (1826–1902), was headmaster of the Boys' British School, Hitchin, from 1854 till 1899. 

From a private school Joshua passed to the Borough Road school, Southwark, where he became a pupil teacher in 1838 and a full assistant in 1842. 
About two years later he was appointed head-master of the Kingsland Road school, Dalston. Studying hard in his spare hours, he in 1850 graduated B.A. in the University of London, and in 1852 proceeded M.A. (in classics).
 
In 1852, after trial work there in the previous year, he joined the staff of the Borough Road Training College, soon after became vice-principal, and in 1856 succeeded to the principalship on the retirement of Dr. James Cornwell. 
He proved himself a brilliant teacher, especially stimulating his pupils by his lectures on 'Method' and by his enthusiasm for literature. 
Through life, he laid stress on the importance to the teacher of literary training. 
After contributing to some of Cornwell's educational treatises, he entered in 1861 into the political arena with Public Education : Why is a New Code needed ? 
In 1862, he helped in the organisation of the education section of the International Exhibition, and in 1803 Lord Granville, lord president of the council, who on a visit to Borough Road was impressed by Fitch's power as a teacher, made him an inspector of schools.
 
The district assigned to Fitch was the county of York, with the exception of certain portions of the north and the west. 
His three reports on the Yorkshire district admirably describe its educational condition then. 
From 1865 to 1867, as assistant commissioner for the schools inquiry commission, he inspected the endowed and proprietary schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire and in the city and ainsty of York, as well as other endowed schools in the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire and in Durham, and his reports were most thorough and suggestive. 
In 1869, he acted as special commissioner on elementary education in the groat towns (Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Leeds), and from 1870 to 1877 was an assistant commissioner of endowed schools.
 
From 1877 to 1883, Fitch performed ordinary official duties as inspector of East Lambeth. In 1883, he became chief inspector of schools for the eastern division, including all the eastern counties from Lincoln to Essex. 
From 1885 to 1889, he was inspector of elementary training colleges for women in England and Wales. 
He was continued in this post till 1894, five years beyond the normal age of retirement from government service.
 
Occasionally detached for special duties in the later period of his public service, he prepared in 1888, after a visit to America, a report on American education under the title Notes on American Schools and Training Colleges ; in 1891 a memorandum on the Free School System in the United States, Canada, France, and Belgium ; and in 1893 Instructions to H.M. Inspectors, with Appendices on Thrift and Training of Pupil Teachers.
 
Fitch's educational activities passed far beyond his official work. 
His association with the University of London was always close. 
From 1860 to 1865 and from 1869 to 1874, he was examiner in English language and history. 
In 1875, he was appointed to the senate, and on his retirement in 1900 was made a life fellow.
 
Much of his energy was always devoted to the improvement of the education of women. 
He was an original member of the North of England Council for the Higher Education of Women (founded in 1866) and one of those who helped to found in 1867 the College for Women at Hitchin, which in 1874 became Girton College, Cambridge. 
He took an active part in the establishment of the Girls' Public Day School Company in 1874, and was foremost among those who secured, in 1878, the new charter for the University of London which placed women students on equal terms with men. 
In 1890, he with Anthony John Mundella and Anna Swanwick selected the women's colleges and schools among which was distributed the sum of £60,000 left by Mrs. Emily Pfeiffer for the promotion of women's education. 
He was consulted by Thomas Holloway about the constitution of Holloway College, Egham, and by the founders of the Maria Grey Training College and the Cambridge Training College for the training of women teachers for secondary schools. 
In both 1877 and 1878, Fitch lectured with great success on practical teaching at the College of Preceptors, where he was examiner in the theory and practice of education (1879–81) and moderator in the same subjects (1881–1903). 
In 1879–80 he lectured at Cambridge for the newly appointed teachers' training syndicates and he published his course in 1881 as Lectures on Teaching (new edit. 1882). 
The book estabhshed Fitch's position in England and America as an expert on school management, organisation, and method. 
In 1897, he published Thomas and Matthew Arnold and their Influence on English Education in the Great Educators series, and in 1900 he collected his chief lectures and addresses in Educational Aims and Methods. 
Written with unusual charm of style, these volumes emphasised Fitch's position as that of a pioneer, especially on the practical side of education, as an earnest advocate for the better training of the elementary teacher, and for the more systematic training of secondary teachers.
 
The National Home Reading Union established by Dr. John Brown Paton and Dr. Hill, Master of Downing College, owed much to Fitch's account of The Chautauqua Reading Circles, which he contributed to the Nineteenth Century after his return from America in 1888.
 
After his retirement from the board of education in 1894, he was still active in public work. In 1895, he was a member of departmental committees of the board of education on industrial and naval and dockyard schools. 
In 1898-9, he was chairman of the council of the Charity Organisation Society. 
In 1902, he helped in the organisation of a nature study exhibition in London.
 
Fitch, who was made hon. LL.D. of St. Andrews in 1888, and a chevalier of the legion of honour in 1889 by the French government in recognition of the services he rendered in England to French travelling scholars, was knighted in the 1896 Birthday Honours. 
He died at his residence, 13 Leinster Square, Bayswater, London, on 14 July 1903, and was buried at Kensal Green.

Family
In 1856, Fitch married Emma, daughter of Joseph Barber Wilks, of the East India Company. She survived him without issue, and in 1904 received a civil list pension of £100 ; she died on 1 April 1909.

557,6715953,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn%20Pardoe,Glyn Pardoe,"Glyn Pardoe (1 June 1946 – 26 May 2020) was an English footballer who played for Manchester City between 1962 and 1974. He made his first-team debut against Birmingham City in April 1962. At nearly 16 years of age he became Manchester City's youngest-ever player, a record which still stands in 2021.

A versatile right-footer who played mainly on the left, Pardoe was a forward early in his career, but converted to full-back in 1966, a position he retained for the rest of his career. Pardoe was part of the Manchester City team in the club's most successful era. Under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison, the club won the league championship, FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup in a three-year period.

After suffering a severe leg injury in 1970, Pardoe spent two years on the sidelines, and struggled to hold down a first team place upon his return. He retired in 1976, taking a place on the coaching staff, and remained at the club until 1992.

Career
Pardoe was raised in the Cheshire town of Winsford, where his father worked for a tailor. In his youth he played for Mid-Cheshire Boys, and received approaches from both Everton and Manchester City. He chose City as his cousin Alan Oakes was on the books at the club, and so joined the club as an amateur in July 1961. He made his first team debut in April 1962 against Birmingham City. Aged 15 years and 314 days, he became Manchester City's youngest ever player. Though Pardoe played at full-back during most of his career, his first appearances were at centre-forward. On his debut he replaced Colin Barlow in the line-up, and he had represented England Schoolboys as a centre-forward. He also won 4 England under 23 caps. After his City debut, he played a further three consecutive matches.

Manchester City's opening match of the 1962–63 season was against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Pardoe was named in the starting line-up, but the match ended in an 8–1 defeat, and he was dropped from the team. Two games later he was selected to face Liverpool at Anfield, but this match also ended in a heavy defeat. More than six months passed before his next chance, where this time he played at left-half for two matches. He made only one further appearance that season, which ended in relegation for Manchester City. The following season Pardoe was in and out of the side, making 21 first team appearances.

In April 1964, Pardoe was part of the Manchester City youth team that faced local rivals Manchester United in the final of the FA Youth Cup. In the first leg he scored City's only goal in a 4–1 defeat, and in the second leg he scored twice as City lost 4–3, making the aggregate score an 8–4 defeat.

Once converted to full-back, Pardoe became a fixture in the Manchester City team, and played at left-back throughout the club's successful period in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When substitutes were introduced to league football at the start of the 1965–66 season, Pardoe became the first Manchester City player to be named as substitute. However, he did not play, and Roy Cheetham became the first City player to come on as a substitute three games later. After spending the opening match on the bench, Pardoe was restored to the starting line-up and played every game for the rest of the season. Manchester City won the Second Division by five points, and were promoted to the First Division. Pardoe was still predominantly a forward at this point. He scored 11 goals in 50 appearances, the most productive goalscoring season of his career. Six of these came in September, including braces in consecutive matches, against Carlisle United and Norwich City.

Pardoe's transition to left back came in October 1966. Both regular full back Bobby Kennedy and his replacement David Connor were injured, so Pardoe, who had played at both half-back and centre-forward earlier in the season, was chosen as left back for a match against Tottenham Hotspur. His performances in the position were such that he played left back in all but two of the remaining matches that season.

By the 1967–68 season, Pardoe was firmly established as the first choice left back. He missed just one match, when injury prevented him facing Leeds United in October. Manchester City mounted a challenge for the league title, with Pardoe involved in all the key matches, including a 4–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur that became known as the Ballet on Ice, and a 3–1 win away to reigning champions Manchester United. City went into the final match of the season, at Newcastle United's St James' Park, knowing a win would secure the championship. City, watched by a crowd including 20,000 travelling supporters won 4–3 and clinched the championship. Only captain Tony Book played more matches than Pardoe in the championship season.

Manchester City had a disappointing league season in 1968–69, but fared better in the FA Cup. Pardoe played every match as Manchester City reached the final, where they faced Leicester City. The Manchester club prevailed 1–0 courtesy of a goal by Neil Young.

Pardoe scored the winning goal for City in the 1970 League Cup Final, beating West Bromwich Albion. The match finished 2–1.

Pardoe's career was threatened in December 1970. City beat United 4-1 in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford, but the match is even more remembered for the tackle by George Best on Pardoe that broke Pardoe's right leg, with doctors at one point fearing that the limb would have to be amputated. The injury sidelined Pardoe for nearly two years, and by the time he returned Willie Donachie had established himself as first choice left back. From this point his first-team appearances were limited, mainly playing at right back during his spells in the side.

In total Pardoe played for Manchester City 380 times, scoring 22 goals. His versatility meant that centre-half was the only outfield position he never played for the club. He retired in 1976, taking up a position in the club's coaching staff, and remained at the club for a further 16 years. Youth development was a focus of his coaching, which included a strong contribution to the development of the team which won the 1986 FA Youth Cup. His association with the club ended in 1992 when Peter Reid abruptly sacked him, along with longstanding physio Roy Bailey. During the 2005–06 season he worked in the media, summarising Manchester City matches on BBC GMR.

Personal life 
Pardoe was the cousin of his former teammate Alan Oakes, with several other relations having played professionally. His daughter Charlotte, is married to Scott Doyle, the son of former teammate Mike Doyle and his grandson Tommy Doyle, plays for Manchester City, as well represented England's U-17 and England's U-16 national sides.

Pardoe died on 26 May 2020, aged 73.

A quasi-military presence remains on the island in the form of an Army Cadet unit and the Maritime Volunteer Service. There are also two privately owned residential properties on Ynys Gaint. One of these had a portion of its garden designed by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis, of Portmeirion fame.

561,10869563,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony%20%28comics%29,Anthony (comics),"Anthony is a Raj comics character. The character and the plot is inspired from The Crow created by James O'Barr.

Origin
Anthony was a great singer and his album ""Crow Sangeet"" (Crow Music) became very popular all over the world. He was murdered by jealousy and later resurrected by nature itself.
Now he is undead and as long as his soul is out of his body, his corpse lies motionless. Though several times his corpse was possessed by numerous enemies including Count Dracula.

Plot summary
The late Anthony Gonsalvez, a young music enthusiast, composed an original album entitled ""Crow Music."" This album became very popular, much to the dismay of his competitors. He was tortured to death by his rivals. He is fondly remembered by his wife Julia and daughter Maria and his pet crow Prince still sits on his tombstone to mourn his death.

Whenever innocent people are subjected to injustice, Prince cries out, loud and shrill, in the graveyard. The air trembles, the clouds thunder, lightning flashes, and the dead man Anthony rises out of his grave to render the justice.

Powers and Abilities
Anthony can make use of cold fire, also called as hellfire, as a  lethal weapon against his enemies. Though he cannot be hurt in any possible human way, after his death he became hydrophobic. On his 2nd resurrection, this limit of his was removed. Anthony regenerates each time after he kills his enemy, and until then his corpse remains mutilated.
He has superhuman strength as of Shakti, Nagraj and other superhumans of the Raj Comics Universe. Psychic powers like telepathy do not affect him at all. He can teleport at any place on his wish.

563,9383984,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%20Clipsal%20500,2007 Clipsal 500,"The 2007 Clipsal 500 was the first race of the 2007 V8 Supercar season. It was held on the weekend of 1 to 4 March around the inner streets of Adelaide, the capital of South Australia. The Adelaide 500 is a unique event where the round results are determined by the results from the 2nd race, rather that the driver with the most points from the weekend. This means, as was the case in the 2007 round, that the winner of the round doesn't necessarily lead the championship after the event.

Qualifying
The event was the first run under the new 2007 qualifying rules, in which the one-hour session is split into three 'knock out' parts. The first major eliminations occurred in the second part when Mark Skaife and defending champion Rick Kelly were eliminated. The front row of the grid for the first race was an all Ford row, with James Courtney from Stone Brothers Racing taking pole and Team Vodafone's Jamie Whincup taking second.

Race 1
Race 1 was held on Saturday 3 March 2007. The race began with Cameron McConville spinning at the Senna Chicane on the first lap after colliding with Andrew Jones. Team BOC also had problems with Brad Jones losing his front left wheel and brake assembly on lap 11.

John Bowe had a bad start to the year with his new team after running wide at the end of the main straight and clipping the tyre barrier. This destroyed the front right suspension on the car causing his retirement on lap 16.

On lap 48, Craig Lowndes was given a drive through penalty for contact with Max Wilson at turn 4. The remainder of the race was uneventful, with Todd Kelly winning the race from James Courtney and Jamie Whincup in third.

Race 2

Race 2 was run on Sunday 4 March. The race began with James Courtney having another bad start and dropping from 2nd to 10th after the first lap. Alan Gurr from Irwin Racing and Lee Holdsworth from Garry Rogers Motorsport collided at turn 5 on the first lap causing Gurr to retire from the race and Steve Owen from Autobarn Racing hit the concrete wall on the outside of turn 8 causing his retirement from the race. These incidents cause the first safety car of the weekend.

Following from the restart, Jack Perkins had engine problems, stalling at turn 11 and being hit by Paul Dumbrell causing his retirement and a penalty to Dumbrell which caused the second safety car on lap 8. After the pit lane opened for the compulsory stops, a collision occurred between Todd Kelly and Garth Tander causing Tander to be given a drive through penalty.

The remainder of the race was relatively incident free, with only minor collisions between drivers, until lap 64 when Jason Bargwanna stopped on the track with an electrical problem causing the safety car to be deployed for the third time. This bunched the field up, causing an 18 lap sprint to the finish with Todd Kelly leading from his brother Rick. On lap 68, Todd Kelly made a small mistake in turn 7 allowing Rick past and into the lead. This is how the race finished with Rick Kelly winning, from Todd Kelly and James Courtney in third.

Life 

Hawting's teachers were Bernard Lewis and John Wansbrough. He received his Ph.D. in 1978. He is Emeritus Professor for the History of the Near and Middle East at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London.

Research 

In the line of John Wansbrough, Hawting concentrated on the question for the religious milieu in which Islam came into being. He analyzed available sources about the religions on the Arabian peninsula in the time before Islam in detail. According to Hawting, Islam did not develop within a world of polytheism as is reported by the traditional Islamic traditions which were written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad. Instead, Islam came into being on the basis of a conflict among various types of monotheists which considered each other to fail in living a perfect monotheism, and considering each other to practice idolatry.

Another theme of Hawting's research is the period of the Umayyad dynasty which was of great importance for the formation of Islam as a religion. Also Hawting's works are related with ibadism.  Hawting is a representative of the Revisionist School of Islamic Studies.

566,15589384,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJXO,WJXO,"WJXO (1580 AM) is a radio station is licensed to Chattahoochee, Florida, United States. The station is owned by Mount Vernon Broadcasting LLC.

History
The station's original call sign was WSBP, broadcasting a country format for most of its early history. The construction permit to build the station was first issued on January 22, 1962. It first signed on November 1, 1963, at 1,000 watts of daytime-only power and under the ownership of the Chattahoochee Broadcasting Company. Emory Pope was the company president.

WSBP was sold to Roscoe Fleetwood in stages between 1969 and 1973. On November 11, 1975, the station changed hands again, this time to Soundway Broadcasting Company, headed by president and general manager Erwin O'Conner. Prior to the sale that year, the FCC approved the station's request to increase the station's daytime power to five thousand watts. The change became effective January 22, 1979.

The call sign changed to WENO on January 29, 1980. On May 12, 1988, the station changed its call sign to WTCL.

WTCL went silent on December 24, 2013, after the collapse of an LMA to a prospective new owner; it remained mostly silent as its current owner sought a buyer or another LMA offer. On February 23, 2016, WTCL returned to the air with a 1980s hits format, branded as ""Sunny Radio"". It was the first affiliate of the format for Whiplash Community Radio, owner of KZOY in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and KZOI in Dakota City, Nebraska.

By 2018, however, Sunny was no longer operating the station, and Faith Radio of Tallahassee was broadcasting on it. Owner Metz, LLC, sold the station to Mount Vernon Broadcasting in 2018 for $50,000. The sale came after Hurricane Michael devastated the region; the $50,000 sale price consisted of payments advanced by Mount Vernon to pay for FCC filing fees. David Garcia, a Hispanic broadcaster, reached a deal for a new time brokerage agreement, but the COVID-19 pandemic derailed his plans, and Hurricane Sally caused damage to the studio building later in 2020. Further, Mount Vernon, which had attempted to finance WTCL's purchase with payments for the lease he held for KMRI in West Valley City, Utah, found itself not getting the money after the lessee fell behind on payments; in 2020, an earthquake collapsed its tower; the collapse and subsequent litigation cost $200,000 by mid-2021, at which time Wood was working with a local resident to potentially return the station to air.

The call letters were changed to WJXO on August 6, 2021.

569,11017946,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix%20coefficient,Matrix coefficient,"In mathematics, a matrix coefficient (or matrix element) is a function on a group of a special form, which depends on a linear representation of the group and additional data. Precisely, it is a function on a compact topological group G obtained by composing a representation of G on a vector space V with a linear map from the endomorphisms of V into V 's underlying field. It is also called a representative function.   They arise naturally from finite-dimensional representations of G as the matrix-entry functions of the corresponding matrix representations. The Peter–Weyl theorem says that the matrix coefficients on G are dense in the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on G.

Matrix coefficients of representations of Lie groups turned out to be intimately related with the theory of special functions, providing a unifying approach to large parts of this theory. Growth properties of matrix coefficients play a key role in the classification of irreducible representations of locally compact groups, in particular, reductive real and p-adic groups. The formalism of matrix coefficients leads to a generalization of the notion of a modular form. In a different direction, mixing properties of certain dynamical systems are controlled by the properties of suitable matrix coefficients.

Definition 
A matrix coefficient (or matrix element) of a linear representation  of a group  on a vector space  is a function  on the group, of the type

where  is a vector in ,  is a continuous linear functional on , and  is an element of . This function takes scalar values on . If  is a Hilbert space, then by the Riesz representation theorem, all matrix coefficients have the form

for some vectors  and  in .

For  of finite dimension, and  and  taken from a standard basis, this is actually the function given by the matrix entry in a fixed place.

Applications

Finite groups 
Matrix coefficients of irreducible representations of finite groups play a prominent role in representation theory of these groups, as developed by Burnside, Frobenius and Schur. They satisfy Schur orthogonality relations. The character of a representation ρ is a sum of the matrix coefficients fvi,ηi, where {vi} form a basis in the representation space of ρ, and {ηi} form the dual basis.

Finite-dimensional Lie groups and special functions 
Matrix coefficients of representations of Lie groups were first considered by Élie Cartan. 
Israel Gelfand realized that many classical special functions and orthogonal polynomials are expressible as the matrix coefficients of representation of Lie groups G. This description provides a uniform framework for proving many hitherto disparate properties of special functions, such as addition formulas, certain recurrence relations, orthogonality relations, integral representations, and eigenvalue properties with respect to differential operators. Special functions of mathematical physics, such as the trigonometric functions, the hypergeometric function and its generalizations, Legendre and Jacobi orthogonal polynomials and Bessel functions all arise as matrix coefficients of representations of Lie groups. Theta functions and real analytic Eisenstein series, important in algebraic geometry and number theory, also admit such realizations.

Automorphic forms 
A powerful approach to the theory of classical modular forms, initiated by Gelfand, Graev, and Piatetski-Shapiro, views them as matrix coefficients of certain infinite-dimensional unitary representations, automorphic representations of adelic groups. This approach was further developed by Langlands, for general reductive algebraic groups over global fields.

The character of Hamlet played a critical role in Sigmund Freud's explanation of the Oedipus complex. Even within the narrower field of literature, the play's influence has been strong. As Foakes writes, ""No other character's name in Shakespeare's plays, and few in literature, have come to embody an attitude to life ... and been converted into a noun in this way.""

History

Renaissance period
Interpretations of Hamlet in Shakespeare's day were very concerned with the play's portrayal of madness. The play was also often portrayed more violently than in later times. The play's contemporary popularity is suggested both by the five quartos that appeared in Shakespeare's lifetime and by frequent contemporary references (though at least some of these could be to the so-called Ur-Hamlet). These allusions suggest that by the early Jacobean period the play was famous for the ghost and for its dramatization of melancholy and insanity. The procession of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama frequently appears indebted to Hamlet. Other aspects of the play were also remembered. Looking back on Renaissance drama in 1655, Abraham Wright lauds the humor of the gravediggers' scene, although he suggests that Shakespeare was outdone by Thomas Randolph, whose farcical comedy The Jealous Lovers features both a travesty of Ophelia and a graveyard scene. There is some scholarly speculation that Hamlet may have been censored during this period: see Contexts: Religious below. Theatres were closed under the Puritan Commonwealth, which ran from 1640–1660.

Restoration
When the monarchy was restored in 1660, theatres re-opened. Early interpretations of the play, from the late 17th to early 18th century, typically showed Prince Hamlet as a heroic figure. Critics responded to Hamlet in terms of the same dichotomy that shaped all responses to Shakespeare during the period. On the one hand, Shakespeare was seen as primitive and untutored, both in comparison to later English dramatists such as Fletcher and especially when measured against the neoclassical ideals of art brought back from France with the Restoration. On the other, Shakespeare remained popular not just with mass audiences but even with the very critics made uncomfortable by his ignorance of Aristotle's unities and decorum.

Thus, critics considered Hamlet in a milieu which abundantly demonstrated the play's dramatic viability. John Evelyn saw the play in 1661, and in his Diary he deplored the play's violation of the unities of time and place. Yet by the end of the period, John Downes noted that Hamlet was staged more frequently and profitably than any other play in Betterton's repertory.

In addition to Hamlet's worth as a tragic hero, Restoration critics focused on the qualities of Shakespeare's language and, above all, on the question of tragic decorum. Critics disparaged the indecorous range of Shakespeare's language, with Polonius's fondness for puns and Hamlet's use of ""mean"" (i.e., low) expressions such as ""there's the rub"" receiving particular attention. Even more important was the question of decorum, which in the case of Hamlet focused on the play's violation of tragic unity of time and place, and on the characters. Jeremy Collier attacked the play on both counts in his Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, published in 1698. Comparing Ophelia to Electra, he condemns Shakespeare for allowing his heroine to become ""immodest"" in her insanity, particularly in the ""Flower Scene"".

Collier's attack occasioned a widespread, often vituperative controversy. Hamlet in general and Ophelia in particular were defended by Thomas D'urfey and George Drake almost immediately. Drake defends the play's justice on the grounds that the murderers are ""caught in their own toils"" (that is, traps). He also defends Ophelia by describing her actions in the context of her desperate situation; D'urfey, by contrast, simply claims that Dennis has discerned immorality in places to which no one else objected. In the next decade, Rowe and Dennis agreed with Collier that the play violated justice; Shaftesbury and others defended the play as ultimately moral.

Early eighteenth century
Criticism of the play in the first decades of the 18th century continued to be dominated by the neoclassical conception of plot and character. Even the many critics who defended Hamlet took for granted the necessity of the classical canon in principle. Voltaire's attack on the play is perhaps the most famous neoclassical treatment of the play; it inspired numerous defenses in England, but these defenses did not at first weaken the neoclassical orthodoxy. Thus Lewis Theobald explained the seeming absurdity of Hamlet's calling death an ""undiscovered country"" not long after he has encountered the Ghost by hypothesizing that the Ghost describes Purgatory, not death. Thus William Popple (in 1735) praises the verisimilitude of Polonius's character, deploring the actors' tradition of playing him only as a fool. Both Joseph Addison and Richard Steele praised particular scenes: Steele the psychological insight of the first soliloquy, and Addison the ghost scene.

The ghost scenes, indeed, were particular favorites of an age on the verge of the Gothic revival. Early in the century, George Stubbes noted Shakespeare's use of Horatio's incredulity to make the Ghost credible. At midcentury, Arthur Murphy described the play as a sort of poetic representation of the mind of a ""weak and melancholy person."" Slightly later, George Colman the Elder singled out the play in a general discussion of Shakespeare's skill with supernatural elements in drama.

In 1735, Aaron Hill sounded an unusual but prescient note when he praised the seeming contradictions in Hamlet's temperament (rather than condemning them as violations of decorum). After midcentury, such psychological readings had begun to gain more currency. Tobias Smollett criticized what he saw as the illogic of the ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy, which was belied, he said, by Hamlet's actions. More commonly, the play's disparate elements were defended as part of a grander design. Horace Walpole, for instance, defends the mixture of comedy and tragedy as ultimately more realistic and effective than rigid separation would be. Samuel Johnson echoed Popple in defending the character of Polonius; Johnson also doubted the necessity of Hamlet's vicious treatment of Ophelia, and he also viewed skeptically the necessity and probability of the climax. Hamlet's character was also attacked by other critics near the end of the century, among them George Steevens. However, even before the Romantic period, Hamlet was (with Falstaff), the first Shakespearean character to be understood as a personality separate from the play in which he appears.

Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view the play as confusing or inconsistent, with Hamlet falling from such high status. Goethe had one of his characters say, in his 1795 novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, ""Shakespeare meant...to represent the effects of a great action laid upon a soul unfit for the performance of it...A lovely, pure, noble, and most moral nature, without the strength of nerve which forms a hero, sinks beneath a burden which it cannot bear, and must not cast away."" This change in the view of Hamlet's character is sometimes seen as a shift in the critical emphasis on plot (characteristic of the period before 1750) to an emphasis on the theatrical portrayal of the character (after 1750).

Romantic criticism
Already before the Romantic period proper, critics had begun to stress the elements of the play that would cause Hamlet to be seen, in the next century, as the epitome of the tragedy of character. In 1774, William Richardson sounded the key notes of this analysis: Hamlet was a sensitive and accomplished prince with an unusually refined moral sense; he is nearly incapacitated by the horror of the truth about his mother and uncle, and he struggles against that horror to fulfill his task. Richardson, who thought the play should have ended shortly after the closet scene, thus saw the play as dramatizing the conflict between a sensitive individual and a calloused, seamy world.

Henry Mackenzie notes the tradition of seeing Hamlet as the most varied of Shakespeare's creations: ""With the strongest purposes of revenge he is irresolute and inactive; amidst the gloom of the deepest melancholy he is gay and jocular; and while he is described as a passionate lover he seems indifferent about the object of his affections."" Like Richardson, Mackenzie concludes that the tragedy in the play arises from Hamlet's nature: even the best qualities of his character merely reinforce his inability to cope with the world in which he is placed. To this analysis Thomas Robertson adds in particular the devastating impact of the death of Hamlet's father.

By the end of the 18th century, psychological and textual criticism had outrun strictly rhetorical criticism; one still sees occasional critiques of metaphors viewed as inappropriate or barbarous, but by and large the neoclassical critique of Shakespeare's language had become moribund. The most extended critique of the play's language from the end of the century is perhaps that of Hugh Blair.

Another change occurred right around the Romantic literary period (19th century), known for its emphasis on the individual and internal motive. The Romantic period viewed Hamlet as more of a rebel against politics, and as an intellectual, rather than an overly-sensitive, being. This is also the period when the question of Hamlet's delay is brought up, as previously it could be seen as plot device, while romantics focused largely on character. Samuel Coleridge, for example, delivered lectures on Hamlet during this period that evaluated his tragic state of mind in an interpretation that proved influential for over a century. For Coleridge, Shakespeare depicted Hamlet's light of indecisiveness as resulting from an imbalance between the human attention  to external objects, and inward thoughts, and thus  suffered a paralysis  of action because his faculty of vivid imagination overpowered his will and induced an aversion to actually enacting any measure   For Coleridge, Shakespeare aimed to convey the basic message that man must
act, and not be trammeled by excessive thinking that only leads to delay. Later criticism has come to consider this view as much a reflection of Coleridge's own problematical nature as an insight into the Shakespearean character. Coleridge and other writers praised the play for its philosophical questions, which guided the audience to ponder and grow intellectually.

Late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries

At around the turn of the 20th century, two writers, A. C. Bradley and Sigmund Freud, developed ideas which built on the past and greatly affected the future of Hamlet criticism.  Bradley held the view that Hamlet should be studied as one would study a real person: piecing together his consciousness from the clues given in the play.  His explanation of Hamlet's delay was one of a deep ""melancholy"" which grew from a growing disappointment in his mother.  Freud also viewed Hamlet as a real person: one whose psyche could be analyzed through the text.  He took the view that Hamlet's madness merely disguised the truth in the same way dreams disguise unconscious realities.  He also famously saw Hamlet's struggles as a representation of the Oedipus complex. In Freud's view, Hamlet is torn largely because he has repressed sexual desire for his mother, which is being acted out by and challenged by Claudius.

Mid- and late-twentieth century
Later critics of the century, such as T. S. Eliot in his noted essay ""Hamlet and His Problems"", downplayed such psychological emphasis of the play, and instead used other methods to read characters in the play, focusing on minor characters such as Gertrude, and seeing what they reveal about Hamlet's decisions. Eliot famously called Hamlet ""an artistic failure"", and criticized the play as analogous to the Mona Lisa, in that both were overly enigmatic. Eliot targeted Hamlet's disgust with his mother as lacking an ""objective correlative""; viz., his feelings were excessive in the context of the play.

Questions about Gertrude and other minor characters were later taken underwing by the feminist criticism movement, as criticism focused more and more on questions of gender and political import. Current, New Historicist theories now attempt to remove the romanticism surrounding the play and show its context in the world of Elizabethan England.

Twenty-First Century 
The scholar Margreta de Grazia, finding that much of Hamlet scholarship focused on the psychological, dedicated her work Hamlet without Hamlet to understand the political in the play.  Indeed, the scholar Linda Charnes (author of Hamlet’s Heirs: Shakespeare and the Politics of a New Millennium) echoed this notion in her review article of the text ""There is no figure in Shakespeare's canon more explored, expounded upon, analyzed, psychoanalyzed, deconstructed, reconstructed, appropriated, situated, and expropriated than Hamlet, Prince of Denmark."" de Grazia points out that many related words in the play such as ""adamah – like Adam from the Garden of Eden – (stone)"" and ""hamme (land)"" have multiple meanings and that some of these meanings are political through their overt concern with land.

Analysis and criticism

Dramatic structure
In creating Hamlet, Shakespeare broke several rules, one of the largest being the rule of action over character. In his day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of Aristotle in his Poetics, which declared that a drama should not focus on character so much as action. The highlights of Hamlet, however, are not the action scenes, but the soliloquies, wherein Hamlet reveals his motives and thoughts to the audience. Also, unlike Shakespeare's other plays, there is no strong subplot; all plot forks are directly connected to the main vein of Hamlet struggling to gain revenge. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action. At one point, Hamlet is resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these odd plot turns are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play's theme of confusion and duality.

Language

Much of the play's language embodies the elaborate, witty vocabulary expected of a royal court. This is in line with Baldassare Castiglione's work, The Courtier (published in 1528), which outlines several courtly rules, specifically advising servants of royals to amuse their rulers with their inventive diction. Osric and Polonius seem to especially respect this suggestion. Claudius' speech is full of rhetorical figures, as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's, while Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers use simpler methods of speech. Claudius demonstrates an authoritative control over the language of a King, referring to himself in the first person plural, and using anaphora mixed with metaphor that hearkens back to Greek political speeches. Hamlet seems the most educated in rhetoric of all the characters, using anaphora, as the king does, but also asyndeton and highly developed metaphors, while at the same time managing to be precise and unflowery (as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother, saying ""But I have that within which passes show, / These but the trappings and the suits of woe.""). His language is very self-conscious, and relies heavily on puns. Especially when pretending to be mad, Hamlet uses puns to reveal his true thoughts, while at the same time hiding them. Psychologists have since associated a heavy use of puns with schizophrenia.

Hendiadys is one rhetorical type found in several places in the play, as in Ophelia's speech after the nunnery scene (""Th'expectancy and rose of the fair state"" and ""I, of all ladies, most deject and wretched"" are two examples). Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. Hamlet was written later in his life, when he was better at matching rhetorical figures with the characters and the plot than early in his career. Wright, however, has proposed that hendiadys is used to heighten the sense of duality in the play.

Hamlet's soliloquies have captured the attention of scholars as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as To be, or not to be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's thought process. During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and sure in his speech.

Contexts

Religious

The play makes several references to both Catholicism and Protestantism, the two most powerful theological forces of the time in Europe. The Ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as having died without receiving his last rites. This, along with Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is uniquely Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have pointed that revenge tragedies were traditionally Catholic, possibly because of their sources: Spain and Italy, both Catholic nations. Scholars have pointed out that knowledge of the play's Catholicism can reveal important paradoxes in Hamlet's decision process. According to Catholic doctrine, the strongest duty is to God and family. Hamlet's father being killed and calling for revenge thus offers a contradiction: does he avenge his father and kill Claudius, or does he leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires?

The play's Protestantism lies in its location in Denmark, a Protestant (and specifically a Lutheran) country in Shakespeare's day, though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to mirror this fact. The play does mention Wittenberg, which is where Hamlet is attending university, and where Martin Luther first nailed his 95 Theses. One of the more famous lines in the play related to Protestantism is: ""There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow.  If it be not now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet will it come—the readiness is all.""

In the First Quarto, the same line reads: ""There's a predestinate providence in the fall of a sparrow."" Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare was censored, as the word ""predestined"" appears in this one quarto of Hamlet, but not in others, and as censoring of plays was far from unusual at the time. Rulers and religious leaders feared that the doctrine of predestination would lead people to excuse the most traitorous of actions, with the excuse, ""God made me do it.""  English Puritans, for example, believed that conscience was a more powerful force than the law, due to the new ideas at the time that conscience came not from religious or government leaders, but from God directly to the individual.  Many leaders at the time condemned the doctrine, as: ""unfit 'to keepe subjects in obedience to their sovereigns"" as people might ""openly maintained that God hath as well pre-designated men to be traitors as to be kings."" King James, as well, often wrote about his dislike of Protestant leaders' taste for standing up to kings, seeing it as a dangerous trouble to society. Throughout the play, Shakespeare mixes the two religions, making interpretation difficult. At one moment, the play is Catholic and medieval, in the next, it is logical and Protestant. Scholars continue to debate what part religion and religious contexts play in Hamlet.

Philosophical

Hamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character. Some of the most prominent philosophical theories in Hamlet are relativism, existentialism, and scepticism. Hamlet expresses a relativist idea when he says to Rosencrantz: ""there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so"" (2.2.268-270). The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek Sophists, who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses, and all men felt and sensed things differently, truth was entirely relative. There was no absolute truth. This same line of Hamlet also introduces theories of existentialism. A double-meaning can be read into the word ""is"", which introduces the question of whether anything ""is"" or can be if thinking doesn't make it so. This is tied into his To be, or not to be speech, where ""to be"" can be read as a question of existence. Hamlet's contemplation on suicide in this scene, however, is more religious than philosophical. He believes that he will continue to exist after death.

Hamlet is perhaps most affected by the prevailing skepticism in Shakespeare's day in response to the Renaissance's humanism. Humanists living prior to Shakespeare's time had argued that man was godlike, capable of anything. Skepticism toward this attitude is clearly expressed in Hamlet's What a piece of work is a man speech:

... this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man—how noble in reason; how infinite in faculties, in form and moving; how express and admirable in action; how like an angel in apprehension; how like a god; the beauty of the world; the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?

Scholars have pointed out this section's similarities to lines written by Michel de Montaigne in his Essais:

Who have persuaded [man] that this admirable moving of heavens vaults, that the eternal light of these lampes so fiercely rowling over his head, that the horror-moving and continuall motion of this infinite vaste ocean were established, and continue so many ages for his commoditie and service?  Is it possible to imagine so ridiculous as this miserable and wretched creature, which is not so much as master of himselfe, exposed and subject to offences of all things, and yet dareth call himself Master and Emperor.

Rather than being a direct influence on Shakespeare, however, Montaigne may have been reacting to the same general atmosphere of the time, making the source of these lines one of context rather than direct influence.

Common subjects of criticism

Revenge and Hamlet's delay
Within Hamlet, the stories of five murdered fathers' sons are told: Hamlet, Laertes, Fortinbras, Pyrrhus, and Brutus.  Each of them faces the question of revenge in a different way.  For example, Laertes moves quickly to be ""avenged most throughly of [his] father"", while Fortinbras attacks Poland, rather than the guilty Denmark.  Pyrrhus only stays his hand momentarily before avenging his father, Achilles, but Brutus never takes any action in his situation.  Hamlet is a perfect balance in the midst of these stories, neither acting quickly nor being completely inactive.

Hamlet struggles to turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends a large portion of the play waiting rather than doing. Scholars have proposed numerous theories as to why he waits so long to kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet feels for his victim, fearing to strike because he believes that if he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet the darker side of revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for their passion, intensity, and lack of logical thought.

Hamlet's speech in Act III, where he chooses not to kill Claudius in the midst of prayer, has taken a central spot in this debate. Scholars have wondered whether Hamlet is being totally honest in this scene, or whether he is rationalizing his inaction to himself. Critics of the Romantic era decided that Hamlet was merely a procrastinator, in order to avoid the belief that he truly desired Claudius' spiritual demise. Later scholars suggested that he refused to kill an unarmed man, or that he felt guilt in this moment, seeing himself as a mirror of the man he wanted to destroy. Indeed, it seems Hamlet's Renaissance-driven principles serve to procrastinate his thoughts. The physical image of Hamlet stabbing to death an unarmed man at prayer, from behind, would have been shocking to any theater audience.  Similarly, the question of ""delay"" must be seen in the context of a stage play—Hamlet's ""delay"" between learning of the murder and avenging it would be about three hours at most—hardly a delay at all.

The play is also full of constraint imagery. Hamlet describes Denmark as a prison, and himself as being caught in birdlime. He mocks the ability of man to bring about his own ends, and points out that some divine force molds men's aims into something other than what they intend. Other characters also speak of constraint, such as Polonius, who orders his daughter to lock herself from Hamlet's pursuit, and describes her as being tethered. This adds to the play's description of Hamlet's inability to act out his revenge.

David P. Gontar in his book Hamlet Made Simple proposes that Hamlet's delay is best explained by conceiving of Prince Hamlet as the son of Claudius, not Hamlet the Dane.  Noting that Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy well before he meets the Ghost, Gontar reasons that his depression is a result of having been passed over for the Danish throne which is given inexplicably to the King's brother. This tends to imply an impediment to succession, namely illegitimacy. On this reading some collateral issues are resolved: Hamlet is angry at his mother for an extramarital affair she had with Claudius, of which he, the Prince, is a byproduct. Further, the reason Hamlet cannot kill the King is not because the King is a father figure but, more strongly, because he is Hamlet's actual biological father. We can deduce, then, that the Ghost is in fact a liar, who shows no concern for Hamlet's own personal welfare. He confirms the fatherhood of King Hamlet in order to give Hamlet an incentive for revenge.

Madness
Hamlet has been compared to the Earl of Essex, who was executed for leading a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Essex's situation has been analyzed by scholars for its revelations into Elizabethan ideas of madness in connection with treason as they connect with Hamlet. Essex was largely seen as out of his mind by Elizabethans, and admitted to insanity on the scaffold before his death. Seen in the same context, Hamlet is quite possibly as mad as he is pretending to be, at least in an Elizabethan sense.

Protestantism
Hamlet was a student at Wittenberg or so is thought.  Wittenberg is ""one of only two universities that Shakespeare ever mentions by name"", and ""was famous in the early sixteenth century for its teaching of ... Luther's new doctrine of salvation"". Furthermore, Hamlet's reference to ""a politic convocation of worms"" has been read as a cryptic allusion to Luther's famous theological confrontation with the Holy Roman Emperor at the Diet of Worms in 1521.

However, the more influential Reformer in early 17th century England was John Calvin, a strong advocate of predestination; many critics have found traces of Calvin's predestinarian theology in Shakespeare's play. Calvin explained the doctrine of predestination by comparing it to a stage, or a theater, in which the script is written for the characters by God, and they cannot deviate from it.  God, in this light, sets up a script and a stage for each of his creations, and decrees the end from the beginning, as Calvin said: ""After the world had been created, man was placed in it, as in a theater, that he, beholding above him and beneath the wonderful work of God, might reverently adore their Author."" Scholars have made comparisons between this explanation of Calvin's and the frequent references made to the theatre in Hamlet, suggesting that these may also take reference to the doctrine of predestination, as the play must always end in its tragic way, according to the script.

Rulers and religious leaders feared that the doctrine of predestination would lead people to excuse the most traitorous of actions, with the excuse, ""God made me do it.""  English Puritans, for example, believed that conscience was a more powerful force than the law, due to the new ideas at the time that conscience came not from religious or government leaders, but from God directly to the individual.  Many leaders at the time condemned the doctrine, as: ""unfit 'to keepe subjects in obedience to their sovereigns"" as people might ""openly maintayne that God hath as well pre-destinated men to be trayters as to be kings"". King James, as well, often wrote about his dislike of Protestant leaders‘ taste for standing up to kings, seeing it as a dangerous trouble to society.

In Hamlet's final decision to join the sword-game of Laertes, and thus enter his tragic final scene, he says to the fearful Horatio:

In itself, this line lays the final capstone on Hamlet's decision. The line appears to base this decision on his believed predestination as the killer of the king, no matter what he may do.  The potential allusion to predestinarian theology is even stronger in the first published version of Hamlet, Quarto 1, where this same line reads: ""There's a predestinate providence in the fall of a sparrow."" Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare was censored, as the word ""predestined"" appears in this one Quarto of Hamlet, but not in others, and as censoring of plays was far from unusual at the time.

Catholicism
At the same time, Hamlet expresses several Catholic views. The Ghost, for example, describes himself as being slain without receiving Extreme Unction, his last rites. He also implies that he has been living in Purgatory: ""I am thy father's spirit / Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, / And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, / Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature / Are burnt and purg'd away"" (1.5.9-13). While belief in Purgatory remains part of Roman Catholic teaching today, it was explicitly rejected by the Protestant Reformers in the 16th century.

Catholic doctrines manifest themselves all over the play, including the discussion over the manner of Ophelia's burial in Act 5.  The question in this scene is of whether it is right for Ophelia to have a Christian burial, since those who commit suicide are guilty of their own murder in the doctrines of the church.  As the debate continues between the two clowns, it becomes a question of whether her drowning was suicide or not.  Shakespeare never fully answers this question, but presents both sides:  either that she did not act to stop the drowning and therefore committed suicide of her own will, or that she was mad and did not know the danger and thus was killed by the water, innocently.

The burial of Ophelia reveals more of the religious doctrines in question through the Priest overseeing the funeral.  Scholars have carefully outlined the ""maimed rites"" (as Hamlet calls them) carried out by the Priest.  Many things are missing in her funeral that would normally make up a Christian burial.  Laertes asks, ""What ceremony else?""  The priest answers that since her death was questionable, they will not give her the full funeral, although they will allow her ""maiden strewments"", or flowers which were thrown into her grave.  In cases of suicide, sharp rocks, rather than flowers, were thrown in.  The difficulties in this deeply religious moment reflect much of the religious debate of the time.

Other interpretations

Feminist

Feminist critics have focused on the gender system of Early Modern England. For example, they point to the common classification of women as maid, wife or widow, with only whores outside this trilogy. Using this analysis, the problem of Hamlet becomes the central character's identification of his mother as a whore due to her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet, in consequence of which he loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she were a whore also.

Carolyn Heilbrun published an essay on Hamlet in 1957 entitled ""Hamlet's Mother"". In it, she defended Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This view has been championed by many feminists. Heilbrun argued that the men who had interpreted the play over the centuries had completely misinterpreted Gertrude, believing what Hamlet said about her rather than the actual text of the play. In this view, no clear evidence suggests that Gertrude was an adulteress. She was merely adapting to the circumstances of her husband's death for the good of the kingdom.

Ophelia, also, has been defended by feminists, most notably by Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia was driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture, a symbol which may not be entirely accurate nor healthy for women.

Psychoanalytic
Key figures in psychoanalysis—Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan—have offered interpretations of Hamlet. In his The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Freud proceeds from his recognition of what he perceives to be a fundamental contradiction in the text: ""the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations"". He considers Goethe's 'paralysis from over-intellectualization' explanation as well as the idea that Hamlet is a ""pathologically irresolute character"". He rejects both, citing the evidence that the play presents of Hamlet's ability to take action: his impulsive murder of Polonius and his Machiavellian murder of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Instead, Freud argues, Hamlet's inhibition against taking vengeance on Claudius has an unconscious origin.

In an anticipation of his later theories of the Oedipus complex, Freud suggests that Claudius has shown Hamlet ""the repressed wishes of his own childhood realized"" (his desire to kill his father and take his father's place with his mother). Confronted with this image of his own repressed desires, Hamlet responds with ""self-reproaches"" and ""scruples of conscience, which remind him that he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish"". Freud goes on to suggest that Hamlet's apparent ""distaste for sexuality"", as expressed in his conversation with Ophelia (presumably in the 'nunnery scene' rather than during the play-within-a-play), ""fits in well"" with this interpretation.

Since this theory, the 'closet scene' in which Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters has been portrayed in a sexual light in several performances. Hamlet is played as scolding his mother for having sex with Claudius while simultaneously wishing (unconsciously) that he could take Claudius' place; adultery and incest is what he simultaneously loves and hates about his mother. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may be read through the Freudian lens as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Her unrequited love for him suddenly slain is too much for her and she drifts into insanity.

In addition to the brief psychoanalysis of Hamlet, Freud offers a correlation with Shakespeare's own life: Hamlet was written in the wake of the death of his father (in 1601), which revived his own repressed childhood wishes; Freud also points to the identity of Shakespeare's dead son Hamnet and the name 'Hamlet'. ""Just as Hamlet deals with the relation of a son to his parents"", Freud concludes, ""so Macbeth (written at approximately the same period) is concerned with the subject of childlessness"". Having made these suggestions, however, Freud offers a caveat: he has unpacked only one of the many motives and impulses operating in the author's mind, albeit, Freud claims, one that operates from ""the deepest layer"".

Later in the same book, having used psychoanalysis to explain Hamlet, Freud uses Hamlet to explain the nature of dreams: in disguising himself as a madman and adopting the license of the fool, Hamlet ""was behaving just as dreams do in reality ... concealing the true circumstances under a cloak of wit and unintelligibility"". When we sleep, each of us adopts an ""antic disposition"".

Gothic
Hamlet contains many elements that would later show up in Gothic literature. From the growing madness of Prince Hamlet, to the violent ending to the constant reminders of death, to, even, more subtly, the notions of humankind and its structures and the viewpoints on women, Hamlet evokes many things that would recur in what is widely regarded as the first piece of Gothic literature, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, and in other Gothic works. Walpole himself even wrote, in his second preference to Otranto: That great master of nature, Shakespeare, was the model I copied. Let me ask if his tragedies of Hamlet and Julius Cæsar would not lose a considerable share of their spirit and wonderful beauties, if the humour of the grave- diggers, the fooleries of Polonius, and the clumsy jests of the Roman citizens, were omitted, or vested in heroics?

Heroic
Paul Cantor, in his short text called simply Hamlet, formulates a compelling theory of the play that places the prince at the center of the Renaissance conflict between Ancient and Christian notions of heroism. Cantor says that the Renaissance signified a ""rebirth of classical antiquity within a Christian culture"". But such a rebirth brought with it a deep contradiction: Christ's teachings of humility and meekness (""whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also"") are in direct conflict with the ancient ethos that is best represented by Achilles' violent action in the Iliad (""I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me to hack your meat away and eat it raw for the things that you have done to me"").

For Cantor, the character of Hamlet exists exactly where these two worlds collide.  He is in one sense drawn towards the active side of heroism by his father's legacy (""He smote the sledded Polaks on the ice"") and the need for revenge (""now could I drink hot blood. And do such bitter business as the day/ Would quake to look on""). Simultaneously though, he is pulled towards a religious existence (""for in that sleep of death what dreams may come"") and in some sense sees his father's return as a ghost as justification for just such a belief.

The conflict is perhaps most evident in 3.3 when Hamlet has the opportunity to kill the praying Claudius. He restrains himself though, justifying his further hesitation with the following lines:
""Now might I do it pat, now ‘a is a-praying;/
And now I’ll do it- and so ‘a goes to heaven,/
And so am I reveng’d. That would be scann’d:/
A villain kills my father, and for that/
I, his sole son, do this same villain send/
To heaven."".
At this moment it is clear that the prince's single mind and body are being torn apart by these two powerful ideologies.

Even in the famous 3.1 soliloquy, Hamlet gives voice to the conflict. When he asks if it is ""nobler in the mind to suffer"", Cantor believes that Shakespeare is alluding to the Christian sense of suffering. When he presents the alternative, ""to take arms against a sea of troubles"", Cantor takes this as an ancient formulation of goodness.

Cantor points out that most interpretations of Hamlet (such as the Psychoanalytic or Existentialist) see ""the problem of Hamlet as somehow rooted in his individual soul"" whereas Cantor himself believes that his Heroic theory mirrors ""a more fundamental tension in the Renaissance culture in which he lives"".

Meta-interpretational
Maynard Mack, in a hugely influential chapter of Everybody's Shakespeare entitled ""The Readiness is All"", claims that the problematic aspects of Hamlets plot are not accidental (as critics such as T.S. Eliot might have it) but are in fact woven into the very fabric of the play. ""It is not simply a matter of missing motivations,"" he says, ""to be expunged if only we could find the perfect clue. It is built in"".
Mack states that ""Hamlet's world is pre-eminently in the interrogative mood. It reverberates with questions"". He highlights numerous examples: ""What a piece of work is man!... and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust?""; ""To be, or not to be—that is the question""; ""Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?""; ""What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven?"".
The action of the play, especially the scenes outside the castle, take place in a kind of logical fog. The opening scene is riddled with confusions and distortions: ""Bernardo?""; ""What, is Horatio there?""; ""What, has it appeared again tonight?""; ""Is not this something more than fantasy?"".

Hamlet himself realizes that ""he is the greatest riddle of all"" and at 3.2.345 he expresses his frustration with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern: ""how unworthy a thing you make of me... call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me"".
Mack says that the confusion of the drama points ""beyond the context of the play, out of Hamlet's predicaments into everyone's"".

Other critics such as Martin Evans expand upon Mack's notion of built-in mystery, claiming that even the textual discrepancies between the three known versions may actually be deliberate (or at the very least they add to the effect). Evans also argues that Shakespeare's impenetrable text and Hamlet's 'unplayable' strings could be meant to reflect the deep anxieties that were felt in an era of philosophical, scientific and religious disorientation. The works (and actions) of Machiavelli, Copernicus and Luther had upset hierarchical notions of virtue, order and salvation that had persisted since the Middle Ages.

Hamlet is in a sense the inscrutable and enigmatic world within which human beings had to orient themselves for the first time. We are each characters in a play just like Gertrude, Polonius and the rest—where they are trying to grasp Hamlet, we are trying to grasp Hamlet. Whatever interpretation we walk away with though, whether it be existential, religious or feminist, it will necessarily be incomplete. For Mack, human beings will always remain in an ""aspect of bafflement, moving in darkness on a rampart between two worlds"".

571,34658796,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactorius%20of%20Lescar,Galactorius of Lescar,"Saint Galactorius () was a bishop of Lescar in the early 6th century. His feast is celebrated on 27 July.

Life 
Galactorius took part in 506 in the Council of Agde, when he was described as ""Galactorius, episcopus de Benarno"", along with the bishops Saint Gratus of Oloron and Gratianus of Dax, as well as several delegates of the bishops of Tarbes and of Aire. His tenure as bishop is attested and it is known that his diocese was well administered.

Legend 
The legend, told in the breviary of Lescar, printed in 1541, portrays Galactorius fighting the Visigoths at Mimizan in 506 at the head of an armed band and seeking help from Clovis. Taken prisoner, he is said to have met a martyr's death, refusing to abjure his Roman Catholic faith. A religious building is said to have been raised in his honour on the site, later replaced by the belltower of the church of Mimizan.

Interpretation 
It is difficult to conceive of the bishop, despite his possible sympathy with Clovis, taking arms in 506 against Alaric II, who had just given evidence of his tolerance for Roman Catholics by authorising them to hold a council. It is more likely that Galactorius was at Mimizan towards 507 to meet the bishop of Bordeaux and was surprised by Visigoth troops retreating towards the Pyrenees after having been routed at the Battle of Vouillé by the Frankish army. Doubtless humiliated by their defeat, hostile to Roman Catholics and eager for vengeance, such a group would easily have put to death the Catholic bishop of Lescar.

Relics 
The relics of Galactorius were preserved until the Reformation in a casket beneath the high altar of Lescar Cathedral. It is unknown when, and how, they disappeared.

572,3317778,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%20%28Scott%20Walker%20album%29,Tilt (Scott Walker album),"Tilt is the twelfth studio album by the American/English solo artist Scott Walker. It was released on 8 May 1995 and reached number 27 on the UK albums chart. No singles were released from the album. It was Walker's first studio album in eleven years.

Walker composed the songs for the album between 1991 and 1992 except ""Manhattan"", which was written in 1987, and the final song ""Rosary"", which was composed in 1993. The album was recorded at RAK Studios and Townhouse Studios in the UK and its release had been expected as early as 1992 but was not completed until 1995. The album is the first installment of a ""trilogy"" that went on to include The Drift (2006) and Bish Bosch (2012).

Details
The songs on the album have a decidedly bleak, forlorn and funereal mood; the lyrics are replete with arcane allusions and recondite wordplay and ellipses.  Like Walker's previous effort, Climate of Hunter (1984), Tilt combines elements of European avant-garde and experimental elements, along with industrial music influences.  The unusual literary, musical and performance qualities of Walker's songwriting and singing are reminiscent of the lieder and ""art song"" traditions – forms which long predate the era of recorded popular music and electronic media.

The compositions emphasize abstract atmospherics over harmonic structure, with minimalist, slightly discordant ""sound blocks"" and trance-like repetition rendered through carefully nuanced instrumentation and sparsely deployed sonic effects.  Walker's voice resonates in a cavernous echo, taking on a haunted, distant, desolate quality, which one reviewer characterized as ""Samuel Beckett at La Scala"".

The opening track, ""Farmer in the City"", is subtitled ""Remembering Pasolini"".  A few of the lyrics are appropriated from Norman Macafee's English translation of Pier Paolo Pasolini's poem, ""Uno dei tanti epiloghi"" (""One of the Many Epilogs""), which was written in 1969 for Pasolini's friend and protégé, the scruffy young nonprofessional actor, Ninetto Davoli.  Throughout the song, Walker's chant of ""Do I hear 21, 21, 21...?  I'll give you 21, 21, 21..."", may be a reference to Davoli's age when he was drafted into (and subsequently deserted from) the Italian army.

The lyrics of ""The Cockfighter"" include ""excerpts relocated from the trial of Queen Caroline and the trial of Adolf Eichmann"".  ""Bolivia '95"" is apparently a song about South American refugees. The subtitle of ""Manhattan"", ""flȇrdelē'"", is a phonetic-matching corruption of the term fleur de lis, which is mentioned in the lyrics of the song.

In addition to a core lineup of musicians playing rock instruments, the recording also features contributions from the strings of Sinfonia of London and the Methodist Central Hall Pipe Organ, which were arranged and conducted by frequent collaborator Brian Gascoigne.

573,50553663,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Sambat,Battle of Sambat,"The Battle of Sambat (, )  was the culminating battle of the first revolts of the Katipunan in Laguna. The battle was the final major action for the Katipunan chapter of ""Maluningning"" ending in the defeat of the rebels and martial law in Laguna province.

Background

After centuries of Spanish colonial rule, resentment towards the colonists, particularly the Dominican friars who owned much of the farmland in Laguna province, grew and grew with colonial and clerical powers abusing their powers and punishing the tenants of the farmlands if they refused to pay their dues. A good example of this is the eviction of the Rizal clan from Calamba town after their struggles with their Dominican tenants. José Rizal, national hero of the Philippines wrote about such issues in his 2 great novels, Noli me tangere, and El filibusterismo. The latter called for a revolution urgently. the call of revolt was answered by the Katipunan secret society. Established by Andres Bonifacio in Manila, within a few years, Katipunero chapters were opened in the surrounding provinces with the Katipunan chapter ""Maluningning"" established in Pagsanjan on December 12, 1894, by Severino Taiño. Members came over from Lumban, Paete, Pakil, Siniloan, Cavinti, Santa Cruz, Magdalena and other towns even from Tayabas province.

The Revolution

In August 1896, the Katipunan was discovered by Spanish authorities, hostilities soon flared and simultaneous uprisings occurred in Cavite, Manila, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Batangas, Nueva Ecija, and Laguna. Such that these 8 provinces were placed under martial law by Governor Ramon Blanco. The Katipuneros of Laguna were forced to meet up and plan their revolution in even more secluded areas. One famous site of Katipunan meetings is the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery.

Start of the revolt
Laguna's revolutionaries initiated actual hostilities late in the year, choosing Severino Taino as their commander, they began their revolt by assaulting their respective towns in the hopes of getting arms from the local garrisons of Guardia Civil as well as to recruit rebels from the native garrisons under the Spanish army. The attacks on the Laguna towns of Lumban, Paete, Pakil, Siniloan, Cavinti, Santa Cruz, Magdalena and Pagsanjan were tactically successful in gaining arms and recruiting the cuadrilleros or local native police of each town. However, no strategic points were captured and the army of Laguna remained a guerrilla force. By the time General Taino organized his volunteers he had with him, over 3,000 men from all over Laguna and Tayabas provinces, the arms they had taken from the Spaniards proved hopelessly insufficient, however, it was now or never for the revolutionaries who intended an attack on the major town of Sta. Cruz.

Attack on Sta. Cruz
The attack on Sta. Cruz was initiated on November 15, 1896 with general Taino attacking the Casa Real and the Church and convent of Sta. Cruz, the detachment of cazadores and infanterias had been reinforced by the arrival of General Nicolas Jaramillo, put in command of the zone of Laguna by Gov. Blanco. The 3,000 Katipuneros armed with very few guns, with mostly spears and Bolo knives faced a numerically reinforced and technologically superior Spanish force armed with Remington and Mauser rifles, as well as some Artillery. Unsurprisingly, the attack failed with the Katipuneros taking heavy casualties.

Defending Pagsanjan
Severino Taino and his army retreated to the crossroads near the Barrio of Sambat in Pagsanjan. This was his de facto capital and base, realizing the Spaniards' intention to strike his positions here, he took to defending the crossroads of Sambat with the remainder of his army, with his rear guard of cuadrilleros under Colonel Francisco Abad. The following day, November 16, saw the Spanish cazadores clash with the rebels. the beleaguered and morale-depleted rebels were rallied one last time by Colonel Abad and as the charged at the cazadores, Abad was shot and killed, falling from his horse. After 3 hours of fierce hand-to-hand combat, the rebels were reduced and General Taino no longer had enough men to fight the Spaniards in battle, he shifted to guerrilla warfare with the remainder of his once massive rebel army. The Spaniards began their persecution and arrest of suspected rebels throughout the province the following weeks.

Aftermath
The revolt ended the chances of the Katipuneros initiating further hostilities against the Spaniards, reducing their war to one of attrition and hit-and-run attacks. This was the case for most of the revolution at this point in time, save for the revolution in Cavite which saw the entire province liberated. Cavite was seen by many Tagalogs as a refuge from the suffocating martial law of their home provinces. The persecuted Lagunenos civilian and partisan, began travelling in droves, in a massive exodus towards independent Cavite, bringing with them their town bands, patron saints and banners. The relative quiet of hostilities helped these people travel easier towards Cavite in what was to be called ""Ang Panahon ng Tagalog"" or the Tagalog Age. However, with the Spaniards executing Jose Rizal in Manila on December 30, 1896, the revolt soon flared up once more.

580,328266,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta%20and%20the%20Bannermen,Delta and the Bannermen,"Delta and the Bannermen is the third serial of the 24th season of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast in three weekly parts from 2 to 16 November 1987.

In the serial, aliens called the Bannermen track down the Chimeron Queen Delta (Belinda Mayne) to a Welsh holiday camp in 1959 so they can kill her.

Plot

On an alien planet the genocide of the Chimeron by the merciless Bannermen led by Gavrok is almost complete. The last survivor, Chimeron Queen Delta, escapes clutching her egg, the future of her species. She reaches a space tollport where the Navarinos, a race of shape-changing tourist aliens, are planning a visit to the planet Earth in 1959 in a spaceship disguised as an old holiday bus. She stows aboard, meeting Mel, while the Seventh Doctor follows in the TARDIS. The Doctor and Mel won the trip as a prize for arriving in the Navarino spaceport in time to be declared the ten billionth customers. As the tourist vehicle departs, the Bannermen arrive to hunt down the fugitive, and they kill the tollmaster.

The holiday vehicle from Nostalgia Tours collides with an Earth satellite and is diverted off track, landing at a holiday camp in South Wales rather than Disneyland. They reach the Shangri-La holiday camp, led by camp director Burton. Delta's egg hatches into a bright green baby that starts to grow at a startling rate. The Chimeron Queen supports this development with the equivalent of royal jelly given to bees.

Delta captures the heart of Billy, the camp's mechanic, to the chagrin of Ray, who loves Billy herself. Ray confides her situation to the Doctor, and they stumble across a bounty hunter making contact with the Bannermen to tell them of the Chimeron's whereabouts. Gavrok and his troops soon arrive. Delta and Billy head off for a picnic while the Doctor busies himself coordinating things back at the camp. Meanwhile, the Bannermen have destroyed the Navarino bus with all its passengers.

Two American CIA agents, Hawk and Weismuller, appear on the scene, tracking the missing satellite. Gavrok booby-traps the TARDIS in an attempt to kill the Doctor. A battle ensues with Gavrok and his Bannermen against the Doctor and his crew: Ray & Billy, Goronwy, Mr. Burton and the two CIA agents. The Bannermen are foiled by honey, Goronwy's bees and finally by the amplified scream of the Chimeron child Princess—a sound which is painful to Bannermen.

Goronwy explains to Billy the purpose of royal jelly in the lifecycle of the honeybee, provoking the mechanic to consume Delta's equivalent that she has been feeding her daughter, in the hope of metamorphosing into a Chimeron.

As Gavrok and the Bannermen attack Shangri-La, the amplified scream of the Chimeron princess traumatises the attackers, including Gavrok, who becomes so stunned that he falls into the booby-trap he placed on the TARDIS and is killed. Delta and Billy leave together with the child, the two agents watch on with surprise and Goronwy winks knowingly as the Doctor and Mel slip away.

Production

Pre-production
Working titles for this story included The Flight of the Chimeron. The eventual title is a reference to the British band Echo & the Bunnymen.

The character Ray was originally created as a new companion for the Doctor as Bonnie Langford had announced she would be leaving the series at the end of the season. The serial, with the working title, The Flight of the Chimeron, was originally scheduled to be six episodes long and to end the season. However, as the serial neared production, Langford had not decided whether she would leave at the end of Season 24 or during Season 25. That fact plus the rescheduling of Delta and the Bannermen to earlier in the season and the decision by script editor Andrew Cartmel to create another replacement companion named Alf (later renamed 'Ace'), led to the abandonment of the idea of Ray as a new companion.

Filming and post-production
The scenes at the Shangri-La holiday camp were shot on location at Butlin's Barry Island in Wales.

The soundtrack of this serial contained numerous recognisable pop songs; all were re-recorded by ""The Lorells"", a fictional group created by the show's incidental music composer Keff McCulloch. The songs featured in the serial were: ""Rock Around the Clock""; ""Singing the Blues""; ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love""; ""Mr. Sandman""; ""Goodnite, Sweetheart, Goodnite""; ""That'll Be the Day""; ""Only You""; ""Lollipop""; ""Who's Sorry Now?"" and ""Happy Days Are Here Again"".

McCoy can be seen wearing his glasses in certain long shots of him riding a motorcycle. The motorbike was made by British manufacturer Vincent Motorcycles. The guitar McCoy is seen hugging at the end of the story is a Squier Stratocaster by Fender, although the model is not one available at the time the story was set.

Cast notes
The serial features guest appearances by Ken Dodd, Don Henderson, Hugh Lloyd, Richard Davies, and American stage and screen actor Stubby Kaye. Morgan Deare later played Senator Waldo Pickering in the audio play Minuet in Hell and Arthur in the new series episode ""Rosa"".

Broadcast and reception

Simon Brew of Den of Geek thought the story was ""fun nonsense."" Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping enjoyed the serial, describing it as ""confident, slick, and hugely enjoyable from beginning to end"". They praised Bonnie Langford's performance, found Ken Dodd to be ""OK"" but thought Don Henderson played it too straight.

David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker found the serial to be even more whimsical than the preceding story but more successful, believing it was ""all in all, a highly enjoyable romp."" For Radio Times, Mark Braxton awarded it three stars out of five, declaring, ""It's mad as cheese and about as scary as an episode of Play Away. It doesn't feel like Doctor Who for a second. But just once in a while the show can afford to go mad.""

In 2015, Steven Moffat endorsed the fan theory that Goronwy is a future incarnation of the Doctor, and said that the idea fit well with the Doctor's line about retiring to become a beekeeper in ""The Name of the Doctor"".

Commercial releases

In print

A novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Kohll, was published by Target Books in January 1989.

It was released on audiobook, read by Bonnie Langford.

Home media
Delta and the Bannermen was released on VHS in March 2001 in the UK and June 2002 in North America, but music clearance issues prevented the release of the serial in Australia. A DVD edition was released in the UK on 22 June 2009. In June 2021 it was released as part of the Doctor Who: The Collection Season 24 blu-ray box set, which includes an optional extended cut of all three episodes.

581,591637,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%20Rabbit,White Rabbit,"The White Rabbit is a fictional and anthropomorphic character in Lewis Carroll's 1865 book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He appears at the very beginning of the book, in chapter one, wearing a waistcoat, and muttering ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!"" Alice follows him down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. Alice encounters him again when he mistakes her for his housemaid Mary Ann and she becomes trapped in his house after growing too large. The Rabbit shows up again in the last few chapters, as a herald-like servant of the King and Queen of Hearts.

Personality

In his article ""Alice on the Stage"", Carroll wrote, ""And the White Rabbit, what of him? Was he framed on the 'Alice' lines, or meant as a contrast? As a contrast, distinctly. For her 'youth', 'audacity', 'vigour', and 'swift directness of purpose', read 'elderly', 'timid', 'feeble', and 'nervously shilly-shallying', and you will get something of what I meant him to be. I think the White Rabbit should wear spectacles. I'm sure his voice should quaver, and his knees quiver and his whole air suggest a total inability to say 'Boo' to a goose!""

Overall, the White Rabbit seems to shift back and forth between pompous behaviour toward his underlings, such as his servants, and grovelling, obsequious behaviour toward his superiors, such as the Duchess, and the King and Queen of Hearts, in direct contrast to Alice, who is reasonably polite to everyone she meets.

The White Rabbit's perennial unpunctuality is a nod to Oxford time, the tradition at Oxford (and especially Christ Church, where Carroll taught) of having events begin five minutes past the scheduled hour.

Adaptations

Disney film

Disney's animated version of the Rabbit is perhaps best known for the little song he sings on his first appearance, ""I'm late! I'm late! For a very important date! No time to say hello, goodbye! I'm late! I'm late! I'm late!"". His initial panicky behaviour is presumably because he is late for the royal garden party where he is due to act as herald; this would be quite enough for him to lose his head to the touchy Queen.

He is often the straight man for other characters' zany antics; when he asks the Dodo for help on getting the ""monster"" (Alice) out of his house, Dodo's ultimate solution is to burn the house down, to which the White Rabbit is greatly opposed. At the Mad Tea Party, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare try to ""fix"" his watch, proclaiming it ""exactly two days slow,"" and eventually destroy it in their efforts to correct it.

The Rabbit was voiced by Bill Thompson.

The White Rabbit made a few appearances on the Disney Channel original show, House of Mouse. His most notable appearance was in the episode ""Clarabelle's Big Secret"" when he confessed to Clarabelle Cow that ""I'm not really late, and I don't really have a date. I'm a fraud!"". He is seen being grabbed by the reservation clerk Daisy Duck in the show's intro. He was voiced by Corey Burton, who has voiced the Rabbit in all English speaking roles for the character since then. In Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the genie was transformed into him.

The White Rabbit appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character.

In the PlayStation 2 action-RPG game Kingdom Hearts and its Game Boy Advance follow-up, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, the White Rabbit leads Sora, Donald Duck and Goofy to the Queen's palace, worried about being late. His Japanese voice actor was Shigeru Ushiyama.

Tim Burton film

The White Rabbit works for the Red Queen, but is also a secret member of the Underland Underground Resistance, and was sent by the Hatter to search for Alice. Actor Michael Sheen stated, ""The White Rabbit is such an iconic character that I didn't feel like I should break the mould too much.""  In this film adaption, the White Rabbit is given the name Nivens McTwisp.

McTwisp appears in the video game adaptation of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland as a playable character. He attacks using his watch and can manipulate time.

Švankmajer film

The 1988 Czechoslovak film Alice, noted for its disturbing interpretation of Carroll's story, shows a dark stop-motion version of the character. At the beginning of the film, the White Rabbit starts out as a stuffed rabbit that comes alive in Alice's bedroom and breaks out of his glass case; he leaks sawdust through a hole in his chest. During Alice's pursuit of the White Rabbit in Wonderland, he physically attacks her with paddles, a hacksaw, and a group of skeletal animals. The White Rabbit is also the Queen of Hearts' executioner, using scissors to behead the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and other characters. Upon awakening from her dream and finding the White Rabbit missing from his case, Alice finds his scissors and resolves to behead him herself.

In popular culture

Television
The White Rabbit appears in the Once Upon a Time spin-off called Once Upon a Time in Wonderland voiced by John Lithgow - in this show, his first name is revealed to be Percy.

 In The Matrix, there are several metaphysical ""waking up"" metaphors that reference the Wonderland stories. Early in the film, Neo is told to follow the ""White Rabbit"" and seconds later, his doorbell rings, and when he opens the door he finds a woman with a tattoo of a white rabbit on her shoulder. Later in the film, Morpheus offers him the ""red pill"" to ""find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes"". Right before he meets the Oracle one can see Night of the Lepus playing on a nearby television, symbolising Neo's decision to ""follow the white rabbit"" and to disturb the order of the Matrix.
 In Pacific Rim, there are several metaphysical ""waking up"" metaphors that reference the Wonderland stories. In the film, Mako Mori is instructed during ""mind-meld"" training to ""do not latch onto memories; let them wash over you"" and to above all never follow the ""White Rabbit"". Later in the film, she does this and nearly kills military staff members.

 In the manga series Alice in the Country of Hearts, written by Quinrose and published by Tokyopop, a character named Peter White is the prime minister of the castle of hearts. He is portrayed as a cruel man who would kill anyone in an instant. He has little in common with the image of the white rabbit other than white rabbit ears, a large oversized pocketwatch, and a suit. He is desperately in love with Alice and often caught rhyming as he speaks. Alice does mention hating him on several occasions and claims to hate ""White Rabbit ears"" the most.
 In the Stephen King novel The Long Walk, a boy named Stebbins refers to himself as ""the White Rabbit type.""

Afterwards, Mamaragan asks where Alice is. The White Rabbit then accompanies them to meet up with Alice and Dorothy Gale. As the group roasts apples and cucumbers at the campfire later that night, the White Rabbit learns of Eugene and Pedro's trip through the Funlands and the Gamelands. When everyone meets up in the Wozenderlands after Shazam and Lady Shazam protected Scarecrow and the Munchkins from the Cheshire Cat, White Rabbit gives Scarecrow the axe that belonged to the Tin Man while apologising for what the Queen of Hearts and her Card Soldiers did to him. When Mister Mind has Shazam cast a spell to unite the seven Magiclands, Scarecrow and White Rabbit start to see the effects of it.

Music
 Jefferson Airplane released Grace Slick's song ""White Rabbit"" on their 1967 album Surrealistic Pillow, with references to the white rabbit character and the Wonderland saga in general as metaphors for drug-induced experiences.
 Electric Six's song ""Feed my Fuckin' Habit"" makes reference to this with the lyrics ""Feed my fuckin' habit... Follow the white rabbit"" (album I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me from Being the Master, 2007).
 My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult's song ""A Daisy Chain 4 Satan"" has references of a white rabbit in their lyrics about drugs: ""I live for drugs... I'm the white rabbit. I freaked out on acid... I'm the white rabbit.""
 Egypt Central's song ""White Rabbit"" makes references to the rabbit: ""Your magic white rabbit has left its writing on the wall. We followed like Alice, and just kept falling down the hole.""
 Shinedown's song ""Her Name is Alice"", from the compilation album Almost Alice, uses the line ""And the girl that chased the rabbit, drank the wine, and took the pill..."" to reference the White Rabbit; the rest of the song also references Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.
 Vladimir Vysotsky's song ""Белый кролик, Алиса и Додо"" (""White Rabbit, Alice and Dodo"").
 Marilyn Manson created an album and song titled ""Eat Me, Drink Me"" in reference to the cookies and drinks labelled ""Eat Me, Drink Me"" that throughout the story of Alice in Wonderland cause her to grow and shrink. The entire song constantly alludes to the story and characters of Alice in Wonderland, and describes a darker side of the story.
 Mindy Gledhill released a song ""Rabbit Hole"", in which she metaphorically compares following one's calling to falling through the rabbit hole, which is terrifying, but also wonderful and beautiful.

Musical
 The White Rabbit appeared as a banished fairy tale creature in the original Broadway musical Shrek (based on the 2001 film) played by Noah Rivera.
 The White Rabbit was portrayed by Edward Staudenmayer in Frank Wildhorn's musical Wonderland. In the show, he is portrayed as a panicky character with a sarcastic sense of humour. Staudenmayer praised the character's role in the story, saying, ""Everything [he has] to say is funny or important."" As well as the character that brings Alice to Wonderland in the first place, the Rabbit is also a close ally of her during the course of the show. His sole weapon is his pocket watch, which can turn back time; he uses it to help himself, El Gato the Cheshire Cat, Caterpillar, and Jack the White Knight escape from prison towards the end of the show.
 In the musical Alice By Heart actor Colton Ryan plays the role of the White Rabbit and its human counterpart Alfred Hallam.

Video games
In the Sunsoft's 2006 mobile game , the White Rabbit served as the ""Guardian"" for Ariko (the ""Alice"" of the game) when she is a young child and was the one in charge of adsorbing Ariko's negative emotions (as Wonderland is her coping mechanism to deal with her traumatic childhood). However, after absorbing too much of Ariko's emotions for years, the White Rabbit has become deranged and murderous. Throughout most of the game, he appears as a mirage to Ariko and is confronted in person after Ariko learns that the White Rabbit has been disguising himself as her female friend ""Yukino"" in the real world. In his real form, the White Rabbit has a very humanoid body and wears human clothes, which is heavily suggested to resemble Ariko's deceased father.
 In American McGee's Alice, the White Rabbit is responsible for Alice's return to Wonderland. He is first seen as Alice's soft toy, then becomes something that resembles a shrivelled version of the John Tenniel illustration. When Alice is chasing him in the Village of the Doomed, he shrinks and goes down a hole. Alice follows him by shrinking herself with a hand-made potion. They meet again in the Wonderland Woods, where he tells her to find Caterpillar. Later, he is killed by the Mad Hatter who crushes him under his foot but is revived after Alice defeated the Queen of Hearts. He reappears as a minor character in the sequel Alice Madness Returns, first in the opening sequence of the game, and then as a host of some mini-games (along with the Mad Hatter).
 In the Nintendo DS RPG A Witch's Tale, the White Rabbit forces its way before the main character Liddell. It can be an unlockable plush for fighting too.

 In the  Eye of the North expansion of Guild Wars, finding the boss Nulfastu Earthbound requires the player to follow a white rabbit into a rabbit hole. When the player enters, the boss appears, along with a large amount of other hostile monsters, that easily overwhelms an unprepared group of players.
 There is a reference to the White Rabbit in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow.
 In Super Mario 64 MIPS the rabbit references the White Rabbit with a few lines, such as ""I'm late for an important date.""
 In Heart no Kuni no Alice, a dating sim game made for the PC, PSP, and the PS2 with the theme of Alice in Wonderland, has a man named ""Peter White"" in which Peter White takes the role of the White Rabbit in Wonderland.

Other Influences
A military trench-digging machine developed by the British Royal Navy at the beginning of World War II was originally known as White Rabbit No. 6, but the name was changed to Cultivator No. 6 to conceal its identity.

In the 2010s, the phrase ""Follow the White Rabbit"" became popular among QAnon adherents, as the initiator of the conspiracy theory often used it to encourage his followers to do their own research about the purported ""cabal"" running the United States.

Biography
Helladius was a non-Christian, professor of some distinction in Alexandria, but fled the post once bloody fighting broke out between the pagans and Christians in 391 A.D., which escalated after the destruction of pagan temples was ordered by Theodosius I in 389. Helladius moved to Constantinople, and was back to actively teaching grammar by the reign of Theodosius II (408–450 A.D.), Socrates of Constantinople in his youth being one of his pupils. Helladius was granted comitiva ordinis primi by this emperor in 425 A.D., by virtue of which he became ranked among the ex vicarii.

Helladius compiled a Greek lexicon entitled λεξικὸν κατὰ στοιχεῖου or τῶν λέξεων συλλογή according to Photius; elsewhere it is stated the lexicon bore the title λέξεως παντοίας χρῆσις κατα στοῖχειον. Helladius was one of the important sources used by the Suda as well.

Territorial politics

Born in Preston, Lancashire, England, Lake was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories for the Grenfell district in the 1898 Northwest Territories general election. In 1900 he vacated his seat to run in Assiniboia East in the 1900 Canadian federal election.

After being defeated in his first attempt at federal politics he ran for his old seat and was re-elected as the MLA in a by-election on March 22, 1901.

Lake was acclaimed to his second term in office in the 1902 Northwest Territories general election. He held that post until the 1904 Canadian federal election when he vacated his seat to make a second run at Federal politics.

Federal politics

Lake was elected as a Member of the House of Commons of Canada in his second run at Federal politics in the 1904 Canadian federal election in the new Qu'Appelle federal electoral district.

He was re-elected to a second term in the 1908 Canadian federal election winning a hotly contested election by just a 100 votes.

In the 1911 Canadian federal election he was defeated by Liberal Levi Thompson and never returned to federal politics.

Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan

After being defeated in the Federal election, Lake went to work for the Saskatchewan Public Service Commission, he held that job until he was appointed as the third Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan on October 18, 1915. He served for six years, until February 17, 1921, when he was offered the possibility of extending his royal commission; however, he refused.

Late life

He moved to Victoria, British Columbia after his career in politics and lived the rest of his life there.

He and his wife, Dorothy, were aboard the SS Athenia when it was torpedoed on September 3, 1939 and survived.

He died on April 23, 1950.

588,997808,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary%20Square,Judiciary Square,"Judiciary Square is a neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., the vast majority of which is occupied by various federal and municipal courthouses and office buildings. Judiciary Square is located roughly between Pennsylvania Avenue to the south, H Street to the north, 6th Street to the west, and the Interstate 395 access tunnel to the east.

The center of the neighborhood is an actual plaza named Judiciary Square. The square itself is bounded by 4th Street to east, 5th Street to the west, D Street to the south, and F Street to the north. The neighborhood is served by the Judiciary Square station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.

Judiciary Square is also home to Georgetown University Law Center, located on New Jersey Avenue NW.

History

During the first half of the 19th century, Judiciary Square had a heavily residential population. Its proximity to the courthouses attracted  lawyers, judges, and clerks to the neighborhood, while its location between the White House and the United States Capitol made it ideal for government employees. Among its most prominent residents were Senator Thomas Hart Benton, Vice President John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster. As of 2006, however, nearly all of the rowhouses in the area were gone, with the remaining houses mostly centered on the intersection of 5th and D Streets.

Around the turn of the 20th century, the eastern side of Judiciary Square became an enclave of Italian immigrants in Washington, the equivalent of a Little Italy, though it was never called that. The Italian neighborhood rested on the eastern edge of the square proper, stretching eastward to about 2nd Street NW. The heart of the community was Holy Rosary Church, a chapel built at 3rd and F Streets NW.  The neighborhood grew throughout the 20th century, with a particular surge of Italian immigrants in the 1950s and 60s. However, the construction of Interstate 395 through the city in the 1970s razed about half of the neighborhood and forced its remaining residents to move away from the heavy commuter traffic. Today, the former Italian enclave is dominated by Federal office buildings and law offices. The Holy Rosary Church remains standing and continues to draw a heavily Italian congregation along with its ""Casa Italiana"" cultural center next door.

591,179439,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%20congestion%20charge,London congestion charge,"The London congestion charge is a fee charged on most cars and motor vehicles being driven within the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ) in Central London between 7:00 am and 10:00 pm seven days a week.

Inspired by Singapore's Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system after London officials had travelled to the country, the charge was first introduced on 17 February 2003. The London charge zone is one of the largest congestion charge zones in the world, despite the removal of the Western Extension which operated between February 2007 and January 2011. The charge not only helps to reduce high traffic flow in the city streets, but also reduces air and noise pollution in the central London area and raises investment funds for London's transport system.

The standard charge is £15, every day from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm, for each non-exempt vehicle driven within the zone, with a penalty of between £65 and £195 levied for non-payment. The congestion charge does not operate on Christmas Day (25 December). In July 2013 the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any vehicle that emits 75 g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 standards for air quality. On 8 April 2019, the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) was introduced, which applies 24/7 to vehicles which do not meet the emissions standards: Euro 4 standards for petrol vehicles, and Euro 6 or VI for diesel and large vehicles. In October 2021, the ULEZ was expanded to cover the Inner London area within the North and South Circular Roads. The ULEZ replaced the T-charge (toxicity charge) which applied to vehicles below Euro 4 standard. Since 2021 the congestion charge exemption has applied only to pure electric vehicles and from 2025 there will be no discounts for electric vehicles.

Enforcement is primarily based on automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR). Transport for London (TfL) is responsible for the charge which has been operated by IBM since 2009. During the first ten years since the introduction of the scheme, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion up to the end of December 2013. From 2003 to 2013, about £1.2 billion has been invested in public transport, road and bridge improvement and walking and cycling schemes. Of these, a total of £960 million was invested on improvements to the bus network.

The congestion charging scheme possibly facilitated a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012, though these changes cannot be causally attributed to the congestion charge. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concluded in 2006 that, while levels of congestion in central London are close to levels before the congestion charge was implemented, its effectiveness in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the congestion charging scheme, though later studies emphasize that causality has not been established.

In 2020, the congestion charge was suspended from 23 March to 18 May in order to facilitate travel around the city for critical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. NHS and care workers are exempt from the charge.

Present scheme

Boundary 

The current congestion charge zone covers the area within the London Inner Ring Road which includes both the City of London, which is the main financial district, and also the West End, which is London's primary commercial and entertainment centre. Although primarily a commercial area, there are also 136,000 residents, out of a total Greater London population of almost 9,000,000. There is little heavy industry within the zone.

Starting at the northernmost point and moving clockwise, the major roads defining the boundary are Pentonville Road, City Road, Old Street, Commercial Street, Mansell Street, Tower Bridge Road, New Kent Road, Elephant and Castle, Kennington Lane, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Park Lane, Edgware Road, Marylebone Road and Euston Road (other roads fill the small gaps between these roads). Signs were erected and symbols painted on the road to help drivers recognise the congestion charge area.

The Western Extension, introduced in February 2007 and removed on 4 January 2011, included areas surrounded by the following roads starting from the north-westernmost point: Scrubs Lane, Harrow Road, Westway (part of the A40), Park Lane, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Grosvenor Road, Chelsea Embankment, Earl's Court Road and part of the West Cross Route (A3320), but the Westway itself was not part of the zone.

Charges 
In January 2013, Transport for London opened a public consultation to increase the standard charge by 15% by mid 2014, from £10 per day to £11.50, if paid in advance or on the day. The increase was expected to generate an estimated £84 million of additional revenue by the end of 2017/18. The consultation process ran from January 2014 to March 2014. According to TfL, the objective of the increase was to recoup inflation over the past three years and ensure the charge remains an effective deterrent to making unnecessary journeys in central London.

On 15 May 2020, the Congestion Charge was re-implemented following a period of suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic. From 22 June 2020, it will temporarily run from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm seven days a week (as opposed to the previous 7:00 am to 6:00 pm on weekdays), and the daily charge will rise from £11.50 to £15 per day for a period of one year.

Fees and penalties
As of 27 July 2020, the following penalty charges apply:

The standard fee is £15 per day if paid in advance, by midnight on the day of travel, or if registered with Fleet Auto Pay or CC Autopay, an automated payment system which records the number of charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month and bills the customer debit or credit card each month, or £17.50 if paid by midnight the third day after travel. Failure to pay after the third day after travel results in the issuance of a Penalty Charge Notice for £160, reduced to £80 if paid within 14 days, but increased to £240 if unpaid after 28 days.

Discounts and exemptions

Refunds are available to people who pay monthly or annually in advance whose plans change; reimbursements are available to NHS patients assessed to be too ill to travel by public transport, NHS staff using vehicles on official business, and care home employees. Residents living within or very close to the zone are eligible for a 90% discount which is charged via CC Autopay. The Residents' discount scheme is no longer open to new applicants as of the 1st of August 2020.

The system gives 100% discounts to registered cars which emit 75 g/km or less of carbon dioxide and meet the Euro 5 emission standard, vehicles with nine or more seats, motor-tricycles, two-wheeled motorcycles (and sidecars), mopeds, accredited breakdown companies, and roadside recovery vehicles. All-electric vehicles (BEVs) and eligible plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) qualify for a 100% congestion charge discount. A plug-in electric drive vehicle qualifies if the vehicle is registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and has a fuel type of ""electric"", or alternatively, if the vehicle is a ""plug-in hybrid"" and is on the government's list of PHEVs eligible for the OLEV grant. , approved PHEVs include all extended-range vehicles such as the BMW i3 REx, and plug-in hybrids such as the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, BMW i8, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (passenger and van variants), Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, and Volkswagen Golf GTE.

Taxis and private hire vehicles (PHVs) were exempt from the charge but the PHV exemption ended in April 2019, except for PHVs which are wheelchair accessible vehicles.

End of Greener Vehicle Discount

In November 2012, TfL presented a proposal to end the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited mainly vehicles with small diesel engines, that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100 g/km of CO2. The proposal was approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013 and the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75 g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. , there are no internal combustion-only vehicles that meet this criteria. The measure was designed to curb the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge. Other changes were the removal of the option to pay the charge in shops, and the penalty charge was increased to £10. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016. In December 2018, a further tightening of the standards was announced, in part to bring standards beyond that of the ULEZ. This means that since April 2019 only vehicles which are Euro 6, emit up to 75 g/km of  and have a minimum 20 mile zero emission range have qualified for the discount. A further phase from October 2021 will mean that only zero-emission vehicles (pure electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) can qualify, and the discount will be phased out completely from December 2025.

Toxicity charge 

A toxicity charge, known as T-charge, was introduced on 23 October 2017, operating for the same hours as the congestion charge (7:00 am to 6:00 pm on weekdays). Older and more polluting cars and vans that do not meet Euro 4 standards have to pay an extra £10 charge on top of the congestion charge to drive in central London, within the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ). The charge typically applies to diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006, and the levy affects up to 10,000 vehicles. The public consultation on the T-charge proposals began in July 2016.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced the introduction of the scheme on 17 February 2017 after London achieved record air pollution levels in January 2017, and the city was put on very high pollution alert for the first time ever, as cold and stationary weather failed to clear toxic pollutants emitted mainly by diesel vehicles.

In December 2017, TfL said that the charge had cut the number of these heavily polluting vehicles by around 1,000 per day, with the remaining 2,000 paying the £10 charge (a further 3,000 vehicles are eligible for discounts due to Blue Badges etc.).

The T-charge has been replaced by the Ultra Low Emission Zone charge, except it is still levied on holders of the residents' discount.

Ultra Low Emission Zone

The ULEZ, which went into effect on 8 April 2019 and largely replaced the T-charge, covers the same area as the T-charge and the Congestion Charge Zone but applies 24/7, every day of the year (except Christmas Day), with charges of £12.50 a day for cars, vans and motorcycles, and £100 a day for lorries, buses and coaches. The ULEZ caused a 20% reduction in emissions and resulted in a drop of the worst polluting vehicles entering the zone each day from 35,578 to 23,054. The zone was extended to the North and South Circular on 25 October 2021.

Suspensions, avoidance and evasion
TfL can and does suspend the congestion charge either in a small local area to cope with incidents and if directed to do so by a police officer. The congestion charge was suspended on 7 and 8 July 2005 in response to the terrorist attacks on London Transport. The congestion charge was also suspended on 2 February 2009, in response to an extreme weather event (heavy snowfall) in the London area.

Although avoidance has become more sophisticated, compliance with the scheme and terms of payment has improved over the last few years, as is evidenced by the income from penalties dropping by approximately a quarter between 2005 and 2007. However, even after charges were increased, enforcement charges still made up a significant proportion (42–48%) of total revenues.

The 2008 annual report on the operation of the scheme shows that around 26% of penalties go unpaid, because the notice is cancelled on appeal or the amount cannot be recovered, for example if the registered keeper of the vehicle cannot be traced, has died, or is bankrupt.

Several newspapers have reported that copied number plates are being used to avoid the congestion charge, resulting in vehicle owners receiving penalty notices for failure to pay when their vehicles have not been inside the zone. TfL has stated it is keeping a database of these numbers and that they will trigger an alert, including police vehicle ANPR camera alerts.

Payment by embassies 
Following pressure from the Mayor of London, an increasing number of embassies accepted the charge and by 2008 a total of 99 out of 128 embassies had agreed to the charge. Among others, decliners include Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, who, by 2015, collectively owed £95 million. The United States and Germany are reported to consider it to be a local tax, from which they are protected by the Vienna Convention, rather than a toll.

In May 2011, Johnson raised the issue with the President of the United States, Barack Obama, who was fined £120 after driving through London in the Presidential state car without paying the toll during a state visit to Buckingham Palace. The United States subsequently claimed diplomatic immunity. A TfL spokesperson noted that US embassies do pay tolls in Oslo and Singapore. In 2014 Transport for London estimated that, by the end of 2013, £82 million was owed by foreign embassies in London: since the charge was introduced in 2003, the US Embassy owed the most with £8.78 million, followed by Japan at £6.0 million, Russia with £5.22 million, and Nigeria with £4.92 million.

History

Background 
The government's Smeed Report of 1964 was the first full assessment of the practicality of road pricing in a British city on the basis of congestion. It recommended a method of ""car user restraint"" by a variable system of charging for road usageif the government had the will to do so. During the early years of the Greater London Council, which was formed in 1965, the first plans were drawn up for a system of cordon charging or supplementary licensing for use in the central area. A formal study was undertaken into the merits of the scheme, and in 1973 concluded that it would improve traffic and environmental conditions in the centre. These plans were being developed at the same time as the London Ringways, a series of four orbital motorways around and within London including Ringway 1 (the London Motorway Box) leading to widespread public protest by Homes before Roads and others. Only a small section of these road schemes had been implemented by the time Labour gained control in the 1973 Greater London Council elections, and the new administration abandoned the road building plans in favour of public transport and traffic management. The new administration, to which Ken Livingstone had just been elected for the first time, studied a congestion scheme similar to the one which was eventually adopted the following year.

Planning and preparation 
In 1995, the London Congestion Research Programme concluded that the city's economy would benefit from a congestion charge scheme, the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 required local authorities to study and reduce traffic volumes and any future London mayors were given the power to introduce ""Road user charging"" by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. In his manifesto for the 2000 London Mayoral election, Ken Livingstone had proposed to introduce a £5 charge for vehicles entering central London.

Following his victory, the Mayor made a draft order and requested a report from TfL, which summarised the reasons for introducing the scheme. The scheme was to be introduced to reduce congestion in the centre of the capital following the Draft Transport Strategy of January 2001 which had highlighted the importance that the Mayor placed on tackling this issue. The charge was to be part of a series of measures to improve the transport system in London and was to combined with public transport improvements and increased enforcement of parking and traffic regulations. The report stated that the scheme was expected to be the most effective in reducing through traffic, reducing congestion both within and outside the zone, improving the speed of buses and the quality of life in central London. It was stated that improved traffic flows would make London more attractive to business investment. Substantial net revenues were anticipated, which were to be invested in London's transport system. It also states that 90% of those who responded to a consultation on the scheme, viewed reducing traffic congestion in central London as 'important'.

In July 2002, Westminster City Council launched a legal challenge against the plans, arguing that they would increase pollution and were a breach of human rights of residents on the boundary of the zone. The High Court rejected the claim. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) anticipated increased volumes of traffic around the edge of the zone and an increase in demand within the zone, that might both adversely affect clinical outcomes.

Before the charge's introduction, there were fears of a very chaotic few days as the charge bedded down. Indeed, Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London and key proponent of the charge, himself predicted a ""difficult few days"" and a ""bloody day"".

On introduction, the scheme was the largest ever undertaken by a capital city.

Introduction (February 2003) 
The charge was introduced on 17 February 2003 covering the approximate area of the London Inner Ring Road. Starting at the northernmost point and moving clockwise, the major roads defining the boundary were Pentonville Road, City Road, Old Street, Commercial Street, Mansell Street, Tower Bridge Road, New Kent Road, Elephant and Castle, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Park Lane, Edgware Road, Marylebone Road and Euston Road (other roads filled the small gaps between these roads). The zone therefore included the whole of the City of London, the financial district, and the West End, London's primary commercial and entertainment centre.

On the launch date of the original zone, an extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 8,000) were introduced. Bus and London Underground managers reported that buses and tubes were a little, if at all, busier than normal.

Originally, Capita Group maintained the system under a five-year contract worth around £230m. Having been threatened with the termination of the contract by Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London, for poor performance, when the zone was subsequently extended, Capita was awarded an extension to the original contract up until February 2009 to cover the expanded zone. Capita employed sub-contractors including India-based Mastek, who were responsible for much of the Information Technology infrastructure. Due to the wide spread of sub-contractors around the world and due to varying data protection regulations in different countries, the scheme had prompted concerns about privacy.

Immediate impact 
On the first day 190,000 vehicles moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday. A report from the Bow Group stated that historically, London congestion is at its worst during the morning rush hour, and that the early days of congestion charging had little impact on that critical time, the main effect occurring after 11:00 am. Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15–20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.

Initial suggestions that school holidays were responsible for part of the traffic drop during the first week of operation of the charge were confirmed when traffic rose again by 5% following the return to school at the beginning of the second week of the charge. Reports indicated that, over the first month or so of operation, traffic was consistently down at least 15% on pre-charge levels, with the second week seeing the reduction drop to 20%.

The AA Motoring Trust suggested that changes to the timing of traffic lights and the end of major road works had also impacted congestion.

The effect of the congestion charge zone on local businesses is a contested issue. The TfL estimates that the effect on business has been overall neutral. However the effect on business differs significantly between stores. Some shops and businesses are reported to be heavily affected by the charge, both in terms of lost sales due to reduced traffic and increased delivery costs, as recognised by the London Chamber of Commerce. In August 2003, the John Lewis Partnership, a large department store, announced that in the first six months of the charge's operation, sales at their Oxford Street store fell by 7.3% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the Congestion Charge Zone rose by 1.7%. To partly compensate for the loss of revenue they extended opening hours and introduced regular Sunday opening for the first time. However London First's own report indicated that business was broadly supportive. Subsequently, another report stated that there had been a reduction in some employment in the charging zone. TfL criticised the reports as unrepresentative and that its own statistics reported no effect on business.

After the introduction of the charge, there were a number of suggestions for its future. Soon after charging commenced, Livingstone announced that he would carry out a formal review of the charge's success or failure six months after its introductionbrought forward from one year, following the smooth start. On 25 February 2003 Livingstone stated, ""I can't conceive of any circumstances in the foreseeable future where we would want to change the charge, although perhaps ten years down the line it may be necessary"" referring to the amount that drivers have to pay, indicating that £5 was sufficient to bring about the reduction in traffic that he had hoped for.

The London Assembly Budget Committee 2003 report on the company criticised the contract with Capita as not providing value for money. It was reported in July 2003 that TfL agreed to subsidise Capita by paying it £31 million because it was making no profits from the project, and that the most critical problem was the 103,000 outstanding penalty notices not paid.

On 23 October 2003 TfL published a report reviewing the first six months of the charge. The report's main findings were that the average number of cars and delivery vehicles entering the central zone was 60,000 fewer than the previous year. Around 50–60% of this reduction was attributed to transfers to public transport, 20–30% to journeys avoiding the zone, 15–25% switching to car share, and the remainder to reduced number of journeys, more travelling outside the hours of operation, and increased use of motorbikes and bicycles. Journey times were found to have been reduced by 14%. Variation in journey time for a particular route repeated on many occasions also decreased. The report also claimed that although the charge was responsible for about 4,000 fewer people visiting the zone daily, that the charge was responsible for only a small fraction of the 7% drop in retail sales reported.
The report also stated that around 100,000 penalty fines were issued each month, of which about 2,000 were contested. By comparison, the initial seven-month trial in 2006 of the Stockholm congestion tax in the Swedish capital saw an average 25% reduction in traffic numbers.

In November 2003, Scientific American magazine listed Ken Livingstone as one of the top 50 visionaries building a better world and who were considered to have contributed most to science and technology during the year. They praised the mayor for his ""guts and leadership"" in introducing the charge which had reduced traffic and his ""courage"" in combating a classic case of externality, i.e. ""the exploitation of common resources by some people at the expense of others"". They noted that other cities were now considering similar projects.

2004 election campaign 
In February, shortly before the June 2004 mayoral election TfL issued a consultation document on the expansion of the zone to the west that would cover the rest (western portion) of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The proposed extension was to cover around 230,000 residents, compared with the 150,000 in the original zone.

Steven Norris, the Conservative Party candidate for mayor in 2004, has been a fierce critic of the charge, branding it the ""Kengestion charge"", a blend of Ken Livingstone and Congestion). A few days before the scheme came into operation, he wrote in a BBC report that it had been ""shambolically organised"", that the public transport network had insufficient spare capacity to cater for travellers deterred from using their cars in the area by the charge. Further, he said that the scheme would affect poorer sections of society more than the rich, with the daily charge being the same for all, regardless of vehicle size. He pledged to scrap it if he became mayor in June 2004 and said he would grant an amnesty to anyone with an outstanding fine for non-payment of the charge.

The Liberal Democrat candidate, Simon Hughes, however, supported the basic principles of the scheme. Amongst some of the changes he proposed were changing the end time from 6:30 pm to 5 pm and automatically giving all vehicles five free days each year so as not to affect occasional visitors.

Preparing for the Western Extension 
In August 2004, following Livingstone's re-election, the results of the consultation on the Western Extension were published which showed that a substantial majority of respondents did not want the extension; however, Livingstone said he was going ahead and that the polls were a ""charade"" which did not diminish his electoral mandate. ""A consultation is not a referendum"" he said. Protests continued against the extension, with residents arguing that only 5% of the road space in the selected area was congested. Following on in May 2005 a further TfL consultation began with specific proposals about the extensions. These included a plan to reduce the operating hours of the charge by half-an-hour to ""boost trade at London's theatres, restaurants and cinemas"".

In October 2004, TfL stated that only seven of the 13 government aims for London transport would be met by 2010. The target on reducing congestion for Greater London overall will not be met, the report said.

By November 2004, Livingstone directly contradicted his belief that the charge would not be raised, saying: ""I have always said that during this term [his second term in office] it will go up to at least £6."" By the end of the month, Livingstone announced that, in fact, the rise would be to £8 for private vehicles and £7 for commercial traffic. Business groups such as London First said following the announcement that the charges were ""totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable"". The rise to £8 was announced formally on 1 April 2005, along with discounts for drivers buying month or year-long tickets. On 10 May 2006, in a live TV debate, Livingstone supported a rise in the charge to £10 by 2008.

A report in May 2005 stated that the number of shoppers had declined by 7% year-on-year in March, 8% in April and 11% in the first two weeks of May. TfL countered that an economic downturn, the SARS outbreak and threat of terrorism were likely factors. At the same time, a London Chamber of Commerce report indicated that 25% of businesses were planning on relocation following the charge's introduction. However, an independent report six months after the charge was implemented suggested that businesses were then supporting the charge. London First commissioned the study which reported that 49% of businesses felt the scheme was working and only 16% that it was failing. The Fourth Annual Review by TfL in 2004 indicated that business activity within the charge zone had been higher in both productivity and profitability and that the charge had a ""broadly neutral impact"" on the London-wide economy. The Fifth Annual Review continued to show the central congestion zone outperforming the wider London economy.

In May 2005, businessman Miguel Camacho set up fivepounds.co.uk (referring to the then-current pricing), whose sole function was to sign up private drivers to their ""fleet"", thus offering the convenience of not having to pay the charge pro-actively, avoiding fines in the case of a forgotten journey and also potentially getting a ""free journey"" if undetected by the cameras. TfL moved quickly to quash the loophole, by demanding that fleet operators provide the registration document for each vehicle in their fleet. Fivepounds went out of business on 26 February 2006.

The June 2005 increase in charges by 60% only resulted in a relatively small rise in revenues, as there were fewer penalty payments. The anticipated start-up costs of the Western extension were £125 million with operating costs of £33 million; expected gross revenues were expected to be £80 million, resulting in net revenues of £50 million.

In 2005, the Liberal Democrats claimed that Capita had been fined £4.5 million for missing the targets set for the congestion charge, that was equivalent to £7,400 for every day that the charge had existed.

At the end of September 2005, London Mayor Ken Livingstone confirmed the western expansion of the congestion charge, which came into effect on 19 February 2007. It was expected that the extension would increase congestion in the zone by around 5% as the 60,000 residents in the new zone will be entitled to the discounts available. Several roads were also to be left charge-free between the original zone and the extension.

In 2005, The Guardian obtained documentation under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 which showed that out of 65,534 penalty tickets issued to non UK-registered vehicles, only 1,993 had been paid.

TfL ran a six-month trial of ""tag and beacon"" (transponder) from February 2006 to replace the camera-based system. This uses an electronic card affixed to the windscreen of a vehicle and can be used to produce ""smart tolls"" where charges can be varied dependent on time and direction of travel. This system automatically deducts the charge so that the 50,000 drivers a year who forget to pay the fine would not be penalised. TfL has suggested that this scheme could be introduced from 2009.

Shortly before it was introduced, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) predicted that the West London extension would cause 6,000 job losses. This was later contested by the Greater London Authority economist unit in a report, arguing the CEBR results were ""unfounded"".

Introduction of the Western Extension 

The boundary of the zone, as of 19 February 2007, started at the northern end of Vauxhall Bridge and (travelling in a clockwise direction) heads along the northern bank of the River Thames as Grosvenor Road, the Chelsea Embankment and Cheyne Walk. From there, it heads north, along the eastern edges of the Kensington and Earl's Court one-way systems, part of the A3220, with the roads in between charged, before continuing to the A40 Westway as the Holland Road and the West Cross Route. The boundary then includes parts of North Kensington, but the actual boundary is defined by the West London Line railway track, which runs between Latimer Road (inside the zone) and Wood Lane (outside the zone), until Scrubs Lane, before turning east, following the Great Western Main Line out of Paddington towards Ladbroke Grove. Here, the boundary followed the Grand Union Canal and rejoined the existing zone at Edgware Road after skirting Paddington, by way of the Bishop's Bridge Road, Eastbourne Terrace, Praed Street and Sussex Gardens.

The Western Extension was officially removed from the charging zone beginning 4 January 2011, with charging on the Western extension effectively ended on 24 December 2010 and enacted during the week of Christmas to New Year holiday period.

TfL provided some free through routes, where drivers do not have to pay the charge. The main route was defined by the western boundary of the original zone Vauxhall Bridge Road, Grosvenor Place, Park Lane and Edgware Road, with some additions around Victoria. To the north, the through route is the Marylebone Road, Euston Road and Pentonville Road.  The Westway flyover at the eastern end is the other exempt route even though it cuts across the north-west corner of the zone.

In May 2007, a survey of 150 local businesses stated they had seen an average drop in business of 25% following the introduction of the charge, which was disputed by TfL which stated that there had been ""no overall effect"" on business and that it had outperformed the rest of the UK in the central zone during 2006.

In 2007 a green motoring website alleged to TfL that owners of luxury cars were registering their vehicles as minicabs to qualify for exemption from the charge. Registering a vehicle as a minicab costs £82 plus £27 per year licence fee, much less than the congestion charge. TfL responded that it carried out regular checks to confirm that cars were being used for the purposes they were registered for, and that they had not discovered any such cases.

Transport for London consulted on a charge for the Blackwall Tunnel in east London, but these proposals were suspended in November 2007 following significant opposition from the public. Former Mayor Ken Livingstone has stated that he had ""absolutely no plans to set up a congestion charging zone to charge vehicles that use the Blackwall Tunnel or the Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road. But if Greenwich wishes to do so on any of its roads then I will support them"".

Proposed CO2 emissions based charging 

In 2006 mayor Ken Livingstone proposed variable charges based on CO2 emission rate Vehicle Excise Duty bands. Charges would be reduced or eliminated for Band A vehicles, but would be increase it to up to £25 a day for the most polluting Band G vehicles. Consultation on these proposals began in August 2007 and ended on 19 October 2007. On 12 February 2008 TfL announced that they would introduce a new charging structure for vehicles entering the congestion zone, based on potential CO2 emission rates on 27 October 2008 following the imminent mayoral elections. The main change would be the introduction of two new fees:
 £25 per day (with no residents' discount) for cars which, if first registered on or after 1 March 2001 are rated in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) ""Band G"" (emitting above 225g/km of CO2), or if first registered before 1 March 2001 have an engine capacity of greater than 3000 cc and for pickups with two rows of seats which either are rated as emitting above 225g/km of CO2 or which have an engine capacity of greater than 3000 cc. In Alistair Darling's 2008 budget it was announced that VED Band G would be lowered to 151g/km of CO2. TfL had not clarified whether the £25 daily charge would be linked to the band until the point became moot as the scheme was cancelled.
 £0 per day (a 100% discount) for cars that either are rated as emitting less than 100g/km CO2 and which meet the Euro 5 air pollution emissions standard or which are rated as emitting no more than 120g/km CO2 and which appear on the PowerShift register.

According to a report commissioned by Land Rover, the scheme would increase traffic delays and air pollution. Porsche announced they intended to request a judicial review, claiming that the new charges were disproportionate and would make no ""meaningful difference"" to the environment. Acting director of the RAC Sheila Raingner commented that ""The congestion charge was originally developed to reduce congestion and that the changes would confuse the public and reduce support and trust for future initiatives.""

At the request of Porsche, King's College released the full report of the possible effects of the new system that was originally commissioned by Transport for London which indicated that the proposed new system would reduce CO2 emissions in central London by 2,200 tonnes by 2012, but would increase CO2 emissions by 182,000 tonnes in outer London, due to drivers of more polluting vehicles avoiding congestion charge zones. A spokesman Transport for London stated that the methodology used by King's was ""less robust and accurate than TfL's methodology"" and that their findings suggested reductions of up to 5,000 tonnes of CO2 by 2009. They claimed that King's College agreed with these results and were making revisions to their report.

2008 mayoral election 
The congestion charge remained an issue during the run up to the 2008 mayoral election. Boris Johnson, the Conservative Party candidate said he would look at a graduated charging scheme, would consult on whether to reduce the size of the charging zone and would not introduce the proposed emissions based charging system. Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrat candidate, suggested exempting delivery vehicles from the charge. Johnson was elected and immediately announced that the emissions based charges would not be implemented.

Johnson administration
Following his election, Johnson announced that the CO2 emissions based charging would not go ahead, saying ""I am delighted that we have been able to scrap the £25 charge, which would have hit families and small businesses hardest. I believe the proposal would actually have made congestion worse by allowing thousands of small cars in for free"". Porsche announced that they had been successful in the high court and had been awarded their legal costs which would run to ""a six-figure sum"".  Their managing director said: ""The charge was clearly unfair and was actually going to increase emissions in London...  Porsche is proud to have played a decisive role in striking down such a blatantly political tax increase targeting motorists.""

Johnson also announced that he would review the Western Extension following a public consultation planned for September 2008. Having held this consultation with residents he announced that the extension would be removed by 2010. Out of 28,000 people who responded to the consultation, 67% of the respondents, including 86% of businesses, said they wanted the extended zone removed.

On 20 October 2010, TfL announced that Western Extension would formally be removed on 4 January 2011, noting that charging on the Western Extension would in practice end on 24 December 2010 at the start of the Christmas break. Other changes implemented on 4 January 2011 included an increase of the charge to £10 if paid in advance or on the day and to £12 if paid by midnight the charging day after travel, with a reduced charge of £9 for people who sign up to CC Autopay (with a £10 registration fee) which allowed users to nominate up to five vehicles with all fees being automatically debited from a nominated bank account at the end of each month.

2012 mayoral election 
In the lead-up to the 2012 London mayoral election Johnson announced that he would give the Metropolitan Police access to cameras used to monitor vehicles travelling in the London congestion charge zone and the region-wide low emission zone, to help detect crime and would ensure that automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) was used ""across all London"" to help track down the vehicles of criminals.  Ken Livingstone said he would freeze the congestion charge for 4 years.  The election was won by Johnson.

2020-2021 proposed expansion 
The congestion charge became controversial again with the proposed expansion of the charge to the Greater London area. Critics cite the charge's failure to reduce congestion, and see the charge as a tax on those living close to London.

Effects 
A number of studies have been made of its effects on congestion, traffic levels, road safety, the use of public transport, the environment, and business activity matters. These effects cannot be causally attributed to the congestion charge, as the trends in these factors began before the introduction of the congestion charge, and continued largely unchanged after the introduction of the charge.

Traffic changes

Traffic volume

A year before the congestion zone, TfL set up automatic traffic counters and augmented them with regular classified traffic counts at key locations, to monitor flows.

TfL's report in June 2007 found that the number of chargeable vehicles entering the zone had reduced by 30% (primarily cars and minicabs, although vans and lorries had decreased by 13%), while there were overall increases in the numbers of taxis, buses, and especially bicycles. The daily profile of traffic flows had changed, with less traffic after 9:30 am and a peak immediately before and after the end of the charging period. The level of traffic entering the zone during the morning peak had not reduced as much as at other times. The overall level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002. Year on year, counts of inbound traffic approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5–7% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained. They had noted a small but pervasive long-term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge. The conservative Bow Group noted that the main effect occurred after 11 am.

Once within the charging zone car and delivery traffic remained unchanged, suggesting that the journeys made by residents and businesses within the zone were broadly unaffected. Changes to the road network over the years has made direct comparisons difficult, but TfL suspect that certain routes used heavily by taxis and buses within the zone have seen substantially increased traffic. On some of the boundary roads traffic numbers had increased slightly but congestion and delays were largely unchanged from 2002 levels.

Following the introduction of the Western Extension, TfL stated that traffic had fallen around 10 to 15% in the extended zone. The original zone showed a 4% increase in congestion, following expansion of the congestion charging area and the introduction of discounts extended to residents of the new zone and buffer zone. TfL assessed the increase in charges in 2005 to have had only a slight impact overall.

In February 2013, ten years after the scheme introduction, TfL reported a 10% reduction in traffic levels from baseline conditions. TfL assessed that the scheme has had a significant impact in shifting people away from using cars, contributing to an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012.

Traffic speeds
The charge operates for under one third of the hours in a year and covers around two-thirds of the central London traffic. In total 8% of traffic kilometres (miles) are affected by the scheme. TfL have extrapolated the trends in road speed in the congestion zone; they have suggested that speeds would have dropped from 17 km/h (10 mph) in 2003 to 11.5 km/h (7 mph) by 2006, had the scheme not been put in place.

A report by TfL in early 2007 indicated that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre (3.65 per mile) in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 per kilometre (3.7 per mile) before the introduction of the congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km (1.1 per mile), or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006. Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.

TfL reported in January 2014, that despite a reduction of traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.

Air quality 
The pre-commencement report from TfL noted that the scheme was not expected to significantly affect air quality, but that offering a discount to encourage the use of greener fuels would be a positive measure.

TfL reported that levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX), fell by 13.4% between 2002 and 2003, and carbon dioxide, as well as the levels of airborne particulates (PM10) within and alongside the Inner Ring Road boundary of the zone.

Since 2002, the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) produced by diesel exhaust has become a serious problem, with the London Air Quality Network of Imperial College reporting that the annual mean NO2 objective (of 40 μgm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006.  Although no areas within the Congestion Charge Zone reported NO2 levels above an upper limit of 200 μgm-3 (105 ppb), some monitoring areas near the zone boundary experienced very long periods at such levels, notably the A23 near Brixton (3741 hours) and the Marylebone Road (849 hours).

In 2007, the Fifth Annual Monitoring Report by TfL stated that between 2003 and 2006, NOX emissions fell by 17%, PM10 by 24% and CO2 by 3%, with some being attributed to the effects of reduced levels of traffic flowing better, with the majority being as a result of improved vehicle technology. In total, the rate of fall in CO2 has been almost 20% as of 2007.

The 2007 TfL report makes it clear that only a one-off reduction of emissions could be expected from the introduction of the charge, whilst further reductions are unlikely to be as a result of the charge.  It notes that lower vehicles emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality as vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along industrial sources and that weather conditions play a significant role, and that pollutant concentrations were being affected by changes in the make up of the vehicle fleet.  It also suggests that the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.

A 2011 independent study published by the Health Effects Institute (HEI), and led by a researcher from King's College London, found that there is little evidence the congestion charge scheme has improved air quality.  This research used modelling and also compared actual air pollutant measurements within the congestion charge zone with those of control sites located in Outer London.  The investigators concluded that ""it is difficult to identify significant air quality improvements from a specific programespecially one targeted at a small area within a large cityagainst the backdrop of broader regional pollutant and weather changes.""  National trends had already shown a rapid decline of some other emissions during the late 1990s, notably carbon monoxide, and levels have been relatively stable since 2002 across London.

A 2020 study of London found that the London congestion charge led to reductions in pollution and reductions in driving, but it increased pollution from diesel taxis and buses (which are exempt from the charge).

Public transport 
On the launch date of the original zone, an extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 8,000) were introduced. Bus route changes have been made to take advantage of the presumed higher traffic speeds and the greater demand for public transport; route 452 was introduced and three others (routes 31, 46 and 430) were extended. The frequency of buses on other routes through the zone extension were also increased.

In 2007 TfL reported that bus patronage in the central London area (not the same as the Congestion Charge Zone) had increased from under 90,000 pre-charge to stabilise at 116,000 journeys per day by 2007. It also reported that usage of the Underground has increased by 1% above pre-charge levels, having fallen substantially in 2003–2004. They could not attribute any change in National Rail patronage to the introduction of the central zone charge.

Parking in outer London 
The charge has proved controversial in the outer areas of London, where it has encouraged commuters who previously drove into central London to instead park at suburban railway or underground stations. This has been accompanied by the introduction of extra on-street parking restrictions and controlled parking zones in these areas, which affects local residents.

Road safety
TfL estimated that the charge has led to a small reduction in road traffic casualties against a background trend of improvement across London and across the rest of Great Britain over the period. Cars and motorcycles have seen the biggest reduction in accidents, whereas bicyclists have seen a slight increase, which may reflect their increased numbers.

Of the reduction from 2,598 personal injury crashes inside the zone in the year before the scheme to 1,629 by 2005 TfL estimated that some 40 and 70 injuries may have been avoided annually due to the introduction of the charging zone, with most of the remaining reduction attributed to other changes to the road network favouring its people-moving capacity.

Operations and technology 

Whilst TfL is responsible for the scheme, the operation is sub-contracted to a number of outside companies. Since 2009, IBM has been responsible for the day-to-day operation of the charging system, whilst Siemens Traffic Solutions provides and operates the physical enforcement infrastructure.  Transport for London announced that from 2009 IBM would operate the charge, along with the London low emission zone under contract.

The scheme makes use of purpose-built automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, manufactured by PIPs Technology, to record vehicles entering and exiting the zone. Cameras can record number plates with a 90% accuracy rate through the technology. The majority of vehicles within the zone are captured on camera. The cameras take two still pictures in colour and black and white and use infrared technology to identify the number plates. The camera network and other roadside equipment is managed largely automatically by an installation system developed by Roke Manor Research Ltd, which delivers number plates to the billing system. These identified numbers are checked against the list of payers overnight by computer. In those cases when a number plate has not been recognised then they are checked manually. Those that have paid but have not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, and those that have not paid and are seen are fined. The registered keeper of such a vehicle is looked up in a database provided by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), based in Swansea.

Income and costs 

TfL's annual report for 2017–18 shows that revenues from the congestion charge were £229.8m over the financial year, representing 4.3% of TfL's annual revenues. A quarter of this was spent on the cost of running the toll system, at £57.7 million. Once other charges were deducted, the congestion charge brought in an annual operating net income of £155.9m for TfL. This income compares with TfL's total revenue that year from bus and tube fares of £4.319 billion.

The initial operating revenues from the congestion charge did not reach the levels that were originally expected. Within six months of the start of the scheme, the reduction in traffic had been such that TfL were predicting a £65 million revenue shortfall.

By law, all surpluses raised must be reinvested into London's transport infrastructure; at the start of the scheme it was anticipated that this would be around £200 million. According to a report issued in February 2007, the initial costs of setting up the scheme were £161.7 million, with an annual operating cost of about £115m anticipated. Total revenues over the first three-and-a-half years had been £677.4 million, with TfL reporting a surplus over operating costs of £189.7 million. The Bow Group, using TfL data, estimated that by 2007 the project had only returned a modest £10 million profit.

Although Parliament has limited the amount that authorities can borrow, for some time it had been speculated that the regular income obtained from the congestion charge and other revenues could be used to securitise a bond issue that finances other transport projects across London. TfL issued their first bond for £200 million in 2005, to be repaid at 5% interest over 30 years. TfL plans to borrow £3.1 billion more to fund a five-year transport programme across London, including works on London Underground and road safety schemes.

From the scheme's introduction in 2003 until December 2013, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, of which, over £1.2 billion (46%) has been invested in transport, including £960 million on improvements to the bus network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on sustainable transport and the environment.

In its obituary, The New York Times described Rabbi Margolies as the ""dean of orthodox rabbis in North America,"" a ""Zionist leader and Jewish educator.""

Margolies was born in Kroza, Russian Empire (now Kražiai, Lithuania) in April 1851 and received his rabbinical training at the yeshivas in Kroza and Białystok. He received semicha from Rabbi Yomtov Lipman Heilpern, the Oneg Yom Tov.  He became the rabbi of Sloboda at age 26, serving there until he was summoned to Boston in 1889 to serve as the chief rabbi for that city's Orthodox Jewish community. He came to New York City in 1906 to serve as rabbi of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, described by The New York Times as ""one of the largest and most influential Orthodox congregations in the country.""

As part of the anti-Nazi Boycott of 1933, Rabbi Margolies rose from his sickbed to address the overflow crowd at Madison Square Garden on March 27, 1933, bringing the crowd of 20,000 to its feet with his prayers that the antisemitic persecution cease and that the hearts of Israel's enemies should be softened.

Rabbi Margolies died at age 85 on August 25, 1936 at the Carlton Hotel in Belmar, New Jersey, with his wife, son and daughter at his bedside. He had been stricken with pneumonia a week before his death. Funeral ceremonies were to be held the following day at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun.

His grandson-in-law, Rabbi Joseph Lookstein, had served as assistant rabbi at the congregation since receiving his rabbinical ordination in 1926, and had filled in for Margolies during his prolonged illness. Rabbi Lookstein became the congregation's senior rabbi following the death of Rabbi Margolies.

Rabbi Joseph Lookstein founded the Ramaz School in 1937, which was named in honor of Rabbi Margolies, known by the acronym of ""Rabbi Moshe Zevulun."" Lookstein's son, (the future Rabbi) Haskel Lookstein, was a member of the school's inaugural class of six students. The Ramaz School had an enrollment of approximately 750 students in 1990, which had grown to 1,100 students in elementary through high school by 2007.

594,4936012,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodotion,Theodotion,"Theodotion (; , gen.: Θεοδοτίωνος; died c. 200) was a Hellenistic Jewish scholar, perhaps working in Ephesus, who in c. 150 CE translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek. Whether he was revising the Septuagint, or was working from Hebrew manuscripts that represented a parallel tradition that has not survived, is debated. In the 2nd century Theodotion's text was quoted in The Shepherd of Hermas and in Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho.

His finished version, which filled some lacunae in the Septuagint version of the Book of Jeremiah and Book of Job, formed one column in Origen of Alexandria's Hexapla, c. 240 CE. The Hexapla, now only extant in fragments, presented six Hebrew and Greek texts side-by-side: two Greek versions, by Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotion's version following it, apparently reflecting a contemporary understanding of their historical sequence.

Theodotion's translation was so widely copied in the Early Christian church that its version of the Book of Daniel virtually superseded the Septuagint's. The Septuagint Daniel survives in only two known manuscripts, Codex Chisianus 88 (rediscovered in the 1770s), and Papyrus 967 (discovered 1931). Jerome, in his preface to Daniel (407 CE), records the rejection of the Septuagint version of that book in Christian usage: ""I ... wish to emphasize to the reader the fact that it was not according to the Septuagint version but according to the version of Theodotion himself that the churches publicly read Daniel."" Jerome's preface also mentions that the Hexapla had notations in it, indicating several major differences in content between the Theodotion Daniel and the earlier versions in Greek and Hebrew. However, Theodotion's Daniel is closer to the surviving Hebrew Masoretic Text version, the text which is the basis for most modern translations. Theodotion's Daniel is also the one embodied in the authorised edition of the Septuagint published by Sixtus V in 1587.

Theodotion's caution in transliterating Hebrew words for plants, animals, vestments and ritual regalia, and words of uncertain meaning, rather than adopting a Greek rendering, gave him a reputation of being ""unlearned"" among more confident post-Renaissance editors, such as Bernard de Montfaucon.

Stewart started his professional career with Blackburn Rovers in 1997 representing England various times at a young age, but left for AFC Bournemouth in 1999 having never made an appearance for Blackburn. He established himself as Bournemouth's number one goalkeeper during the 2000–01 season, only to be dislodged during the 2002–03 season. Having been the club's number one goalkeeper again during the 2005–06 season, he played less regularly in the next two seasons, and was released by Bournemouth in 2008, having made 179 appearances for the club. He then switched to Conference South side Dorchester Town, making 47 appearances before briefly leaving competitive football. He joined Conference South side Welling United in 2010, and made 12 appearances before joining Yeovil Town as a player/goalkeeping coach. Now, being promoted to assistant first team goalkeeping coach alongside Neil Moss, Stewart follows club plans to achieve premier league status once more and continue Bournemouth's well known goalkeeping department producing careers for many goalkeepers. Aiming to maintain his position and reputation but always striving for more.

Career
Stewart was born in Preston, Lancashire. After beginning his career with Blackburn Rovers, he moved to AFC Bournemouth in 1999. He played regularly until 2002–03 season. Since 2005, he has made a number more first team appearances. During the 2007–08 season he made a total of 21 appearances in all competitions, though he was released at the end of the season.

Stewart signed a one-year contract with Conference South side Dorchester Town in August 2008. He has also joined the AFC Bournemouth Community Sports Trust as a community coach for school children in the local area.

On 30 September 2010, Stewart joined Conference South side Welling United.

On 14 January 2011, Stewart joined League One side Yeovil Town as a player-goalkeeping coach. After Yeovil's on loan goalkeeper Marek Štěch was called up to the Czech Republic national under-21 football team in November 2011, Stewart made his Yeovil debut in the FA Cup against Hereford United. He kept a clean sheet, as Yeovil won 3–0. Stewart made a further three appearances for Yeovil that season. Stewart's next appearance came as a substitute for Štěch after just eight minutes, in Yeovil's first home league game in the Championship in August 2013 against Birmingham City. His next and final appearance for Yeovil came as a substitute for Artur Krysiak, on 28 February 2015, against Scunthorpe United, and saved former Yeovil striker Paddy Madden's penalty. Stewart left Yeovil after more than three years after the club's relegation to League Two at the end of the 2014–15 season, due to financial cutbacks.

Following his release from Yeovil, Stewart returned to Bournemouth to work with the club's academy and under 23's.

In August 2017, Stewart joined Southern League Premier Division side Weymouth on non-contract terms.

598,49187020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple%20beam%20balance,Triple beam balance,"The triple beam balance is an instrument used to measure mass very precisely. Such devices typically have a reading error of ±0.05 grams. Its name refers to its three beams, where the middle beam is the largest, the far beam of medium size, and the front beam the smallest. The difference in size of the beams indicates the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam measures. Typically, the reading scale of the middle beam reads in 100 gram increments, the far beam in 10 gram increments, and the front beam can read from 0 to 10 grams. The triple beam balance can be used to measure mass directly from the objects, find mass by difference for liquid, and measure out substances.

Parts 
The parts of triple beam balance are identified as the following.

 Weighing pan - The area in which an object is placed in order to be weighed.
 Base - The base rests underneath the weighing pan and can usually be customized to fit on a workbench or set up with tripod legs.
 Beams - The three beams on the balance are used to set the level of precision, with each beam working at different increments (1-10 grams, 10 grams and 100 grams). When using the triple beam balance, it is recommended that one start with the lowest level of precision (e.g 100 gram increments). For example, if an object weighs 327 grams, the 100 gram pointer will drop below the fixed mark on the 4th notch (400g); it will then need to be moved back to the third notch (300g). This process will then need to be repeated for the 10 gram increments (20g) and then single figure units (7g).
 Riders - The riders are the sliding pointers placed on top of the balance beams to indicate the mass in grams on the pan and beam.
 Pointers - The scale pointer marks the equal point of the object's mass on the scale and mass on the beam
 Zero adjustment knob - This is used to manually adjust the triple beam balance to the 'zero' mark (check to ensure that the pointer is at zero before use).

Before using triple beam balance, the scale pointer should be at zero. The zero adjustment knob can be used to adjust the scale pointer. The objects are placed on the pan and the riders are adjusted. The hundred rider should be initially adjusted and follow by the tens rider. The ones rider is adjusted until the scale pointer is at zero again.

599,94320,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus%20classification,Virus classification,"Virus classification is the process of naming viruses and placing them into a taxonomic system similar to the classification systems used for cellular organisms.

Viruses are classified by phenotypic characteristics, such as morphology, nucleic acid type, mode of replication, host organisms, and the type of disease they cause. The formal taxonomic classification of viruses is the responsibility of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) system, although the Baltimore classification system can be used to place viruses into one of seven groups based on their manner of mRNA synthesis. Specific naming conventions and further classification guidelines are set out by the ICTV.

A catalogue of all the world's known viruses has been proposed and, in 2013, some preliminary efforts were underway.

Definitions

Species definition 
Species form the basis for any biological classification system. Before 1982, it was thought that viruses could not be made to fit Ernst Mayr's reproductive concept of species, and so were not amenable to such treatment. In 1982, the ICTV started to define a species as ""a cluster of strains"" with unique identifying qualities. In 1991, the more specific principle that a virus species is a polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche was adopted.

In July 2013, the ICTV definition of species changed to state: ""A species is a monophyletic group of viruses whose properties can be distinguished from those of other species by multiple criteria."" These criteria include the structure of the capsid, the existence of an envelope, the gene expression program for its proteins, host range, pathogenicity, and most importantly genetic sequence similarity and phylogenetic relationship.

The actual criteria used vary by the taxon, and can be inconsistent (arbitrary similarity thresholds) or unrelated to lineage (geography) at times. The matter is, for many, not yet settled.

Virus definition 
The currently accepted and formal definition of a 'virus' was accepted by the ICTV Executive Committee in November 2020 and ratified in March 2021, and is as follows:

ICTV classification

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses began to devise and implement rules for the naming and classification of viruses early in the 1970s, an effort that continues to the present. The ICTV is the only body charged by the International Union of Microbiological Societies with the task of developing, refining, and maintaining a universal virus taxonomy. The system shares many features with the classification system of cellular organisms, such as taxon structure. However, some differences exist, such as the universal use of italics for all taxonomic names, unlike in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

Viral classification starts at the level of realm and continues as follows, with the taxonomic suffixes in parentheses:

Realm (-viria)
Subrealm (-vira)
Kingdom (-virae)
Subkingdom (-virites)
Phylum (-viricota)
Subphylum (-viricotina)
Class (-viricetes)
Subclass (-viricetidae)
Order (-virales)
Suborder (-virineae)
Family (-viridae)
Subfamily (-virinae)
Genus (-virus)
Subgenus (-virus)
Species

Unlike the system of binomial nomenclature adopted in cellular species, there is currently no standardized form for virus species names. At present, the ICTV mandates that a species name must contain as few words as possible while remaining distinct, and must not only contain the word virus and the host name. Species names often take the form of [Disease] virus, particularly for higher plants and animals. In 2019, the ICTV published a proposal to adopt a more formalized system of binomial nomenclature for virus species names, to be voted on in 2020. However, some virologists later objected to the potential naming system change, arguing that the debate came while many in the field were preoccupied due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of 2019, all levels of taxa except subrealm, subkingdom, and subclass are used. Four realms, one incertae sedis order, 24 incertae sedis families, and three incertae sedis genera are recognized:

Realms: Duplodnaviria, Monodnaviria, Adnaviria, Ribozyviria, Riboviria, and Varidnaviria

Incertae sedis families:

Alphasatellitidae
Ampullaviridae
Anelloviridae
Avsunviroidae
Baculoviridae
Bicaudaviridae
Clavaviridae
Finnlakeviridae
Fuselloviridae
Globuloviridae
Guttaviridae
Halspiviridae
Hytrosaviridae
Nimaviridae
Nudiviridae
Ovaliviridae
Plasmaviridae
Polydnaviridae
Portogloboviridae
Pospiviroidae
Spiraviridae
Thaspiviridae
Tolecusatellitidae
Tristromaviridae

Incertae sedis genera: Dinodnavirus, Rhizidiovirus

Structure-based virus classification

It has been suggested that similarity in virion assembly and structure observed for certain viral groups infecting hosts from different domains of life (e.g., bacterial tectiviruses and eukaryotic adenoviruses or prokaryotic Caudovirales and eukaryotic herpesviruses) reflects an evolutionary relationship between these viruses. Therefore, structural relationship between viruses has been suggested to be used as a basis for defining higher-level taxa – structure-based viral lineages – that could complement the ICTV classification scheme of 2010.

The ICTV has gradually added many higher-level taxa using relationships in protein folds. All four realms defined in the 2019 release are defined by the presence of a protein of a certain structural family.

Baltimore classification

Baltimore classification (first defined in 1971) is a classification system that places viruses into one of seven groups depending on a combination of their nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), strandedness (single-stranded or double-stranded), sense, and method of replication. Named after David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, these groups are designated by Roman numerals. Other classifications are determined by the disease caused by the virus or its morphology, neither of which are satisfactory due to different viruses either causing the same disease or looking very similar. In addition, viral structures are often difficult to determine under the microscope. Classifying viruses according to their genome means that those in a given category will all behave in a similar fashion, offering some indication of how to proceed with further research. Viruses can be placed in one of the seven following groups:

DNA viruses

Viruses with a DNA genome, except for the DNA reverse transcribing viruses, are members of three of the four recognized viral realms: Duplodnaviria, Monodnaviria, and Varidnaviria. But the incertae sedis order Ligamenvirales, and many other incertae sedis families and genera, are also used to classify DNA viruses. The domains Duplodnaviria and Varidnaviria consist of double-stranded DNA viruses; other double-stranded DNA viruses are incertae sedis. The domain Monodnaviria consists of single-stranded DNA viruses that generally encode a HUH endonuclease; other single-stranded DNA viruses are incertae sedis.

Group I: viruses possess double-stranded DNA. Viruses that cause chickenpox and herpes are found here.
Group II: viruses possess single-stranded DNA.

RNA viruses

All viruses that have an RNA genome, and that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), are members of the kingdom Orthornavirae, within the realm Riboviria.

Group III: viruses possess double-stranded RNA genomes, e.g. rotavirus. 
Group IV: viruses possess positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. Many well known viruses are found in this group, including the picornaviruses (which is a family of viruses that includes well-known viruses like Hepatitis A virus, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, poliovirus, and foot-and-mouth virus), SARS virus, hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, and rubella virus.
Group V: viruses possess negative-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. Ebola and Marburg viruses are well known members of this group, along with influenza virus, measles, mumps and rabies.

Reverse transcribing viruses
All viruses that encode a reverse transcriptase (also known as RT or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) are members of the class Revtraviricetes, within the phylum Arterviricota, kingdom Pararnavirae, and realm Riboviria. The class Blubervirales contains the single family Hepadnaviridae of DNA RT (reverse transcribing) viruses; all other RT viruses are members of the class Ortervirales.

Group VI: viruses possess single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate. The retroviruses are included in this group, of which HIV is a member.
Group VII: viruses possess double-stranded DNA genomes and replicate using reverse transcriptase. The hepatitis B virus can be found in this group.

Historical systems

Holmes classification 
Holmes (1948) used a Linnaean taxonomy with binomial nomenclature to classify viruses into 3 groups under one order, Virales. They are placed as follows:

Group I: Phaginae (attacks bacteria)
Group II: Phytophaginae (attacks plants)
Group III: Zoophaginae (attacks animals)

The system was not accepted by others due to its neglect of morphological similarities.

Subviral agents

The following infectious agents are smaller than viruses and have only some of their properties. Since 2015, the ICTV has allowed them to be classified in a similar way as viruses are.

Viroids and virus-dependent agents

Viroids

Family Avsunviroidae
Genus Avsunviroid; type species: Avocado sunblotch viroid
Genus Pelamoviroid; type species: Peach latent mosaic viroid
Genus Elaviroid; type species: Eggplant latent viroid
Family Pospiviroidae
Genus Pospiviroid; type species: Potato spindle tuber viroid
Genus Hostuviroid; type species: Hop stunt viroid
Genus Cocadviroid; type species: Coconut cadang-cadang viroid
Genus Apscaviroid; type species: Apple scar skin viroid
Genus Coleviroid; type species: Coleus blumei viroid 1

Satellites

Satellites depend on co-infection of a host cell with a helper virus for productive multiplication. Their nucleic acids have substantially distinct nucleotide sequences from either their helper virus or host. When a satellite subviral agent encodes the coat protein in which it is encapsulated, it is then called a satellite virus.

Satellite-like nucleic acids resemble satellite nucleic acids, in that they replicate with the aid of helper viruses. However they differ in that they can encode functions that can contribute to the success of their helper viruses; while they are sometimes considered to be genomic elements of their helper viruses, they are not always found within their helper viruses.

A triple bolus test is usually ordered and interpreted by endocrinologists.

In rare cases, it has been associated with pituitary apoplexy.

Process
Three hormones (usually synthetic analogues) are injected as a bolus into the patient's vein to stimulate the anterior pituitary gland:
 insulin
 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
 thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)

The gland's response is assessed by measuring the rise in cortisol and growth hormone (GH) in response to the hypoglycaemia caused by insulin, rises in prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) caused by TRH and rises in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) caused by GnRH.  Blood glucose levels are also monitored to ensure appropriate levels of hypoglycemia are achieved.

History
The triple bolus test was introduced in 1973 by physicians from the London Royal Postgraduate Medical School and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. It followed earlier reports combining insulin and vasopressin analogues in the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.

602,8982823,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakpure,Fakpure,"The Fakpure was the secular ruler of Rotuma in the pre-European contact times.  It was one of three chiefly roles with direct influence across the island of Rotuma, the other two being the Mua and the Sau. Traditionally the most senior political authority on the island, the Fakpure was one of the gagaj ‘es itu’u of the districts of Rotuma, and the convener of the island’s Council of Chiefs. After being elected as the district chief through the traditional processes (see gagaja), the position of fakpure was bestowed on the most senior of these district chiefs, usually the chief whose district had won the most recent war, who also received the privilege of being the first served in the politically charged kava ceremony.

Overview
In the early European writings on Rotuma, (therefore the earliest recorded information on Rotuma, being prior to Western contact, an oral-based culture), the prevailing understanding of the fakpure was that, prior to Western influence, he was convener and presiding officer of the council of district chiefs, and that he was charged with the appointment and maintenance of the Sau, ensuring that the Sau, as an earthly altar to placate the gods of fertility was treated lavishly.

Although the conditions in which the Fakpure functioned have necessarily changed dramatically, the role of the fakpure, while not strictly existent any more, has been succeeded by the position of the Chair of the Rotuma Island Council. The district claiming the position of Chair and first precedence in the traditional kava ceremony is, in line with Fijian precepts of chiefdom, the ""chiefly"" district of Noa’tau, who led the Wesleyan alliance, the victors in the Rotuman Religious Wars, the last war on the island which culminated in Rotuma's cession to Great Britain in 1881.

604,2063080,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive%20slave%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States,Fugitive slave laws in the United States,"The fugitive slave laws were laws passed by the United States Congress in 1793 and 1850 to provide for the return of enslaved people who escaped from one state into another state or territory. The idea of the fugitive slave law was derived from the Fugitive Slave Clause which is in the United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 2, Paragraph 3). It was thought that forcing states to deliver fugitive slaves back to enslavement violated states' rights due to state sovereignty and was believed that seizing state property should not be left up to the states. The Fugitive Slave Clause states that fugitive slaves ""shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due"", which abridged state rights because forcing people back into slavery was a form of retrieving private property. The Compromise of 1850 entailed a series of laws that allowed slavery in the new territories and forced officials in free states to give a hearing to slave-owners without a jury.

Pre-colonial and colonial eras

The New England Articles of Confederation of 1643 contained a clause that provided for the forced re-enslavement of free blacks. However, this only referred to the confederation of colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven, and was unrelated to the Articles of Confederation of the United States formed after the Declaration of Independence. Both Africans and Native Americans were enslaved in New England beginning in the 18th century. The Articles for the New England Confederation provided for the forced re-enslavement of free people in Section 8:

As the colonies expanded with waves of settlers pushing westward, slavery went along with them, prompting further legislation of a similar nature. Serious attempts at formulating a uniform policy for the forced re-enslavement of free people began under the Articles of Confederation of the United States in 1785.

1785 attempt
There were two attempts at implementing a fugitive slave law in the Congress of the Confederation in order to provide slave-owners who enslaved free people with a way of forcing enslavement on free people.

The Ordinance of 1784 was drafted by a Congressional committee headed by Thomas Jefferson, and its provisions applied to all United States territory west of the original 13 states. The original version was read to Congress on March 1, 1784, and it contained a clause stating:

That after the year 1800 of the Christian Era, there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said states, otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted to have been personally guilty.

This was removed prior to final enactment of the ordinance on 23 April 1784. However, the issue did not die there, and on 6 April 1785 Rufus King introduced a resolution to re-implement the slavery prohibition in the 1784 ordinance, containing a freedom seeker provision in the hope that this would reduce opposition to the objective of the resolution. The resolution contained the phrase:

Provided always, that upon the escape of any person into any of the states described in the said resolve of Congress of the 23d day of April, 1784, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the thirteen original states, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and carried back to the person claiming his labor or service as aforesaid, this resolve notwithstanding.

The unsuccessful resolution was the first attempt to include a freedom seeker provision in U.S. legislation.

While the original 1784 ordinance applied to all U.S. territory that was not a part of any existing state (and thus, to all future states), the 1787 ordinance applied only to the Northwest Territory.

Northwest Ordinance of 1787

Congress made a further attempt to address the concerns of people who wanted to enslave free people in 1787 by passing the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The law appeared to outlaw enslavement, which would have reduced the votes of enslaving states in Congress, but southern representatives were concerned with economic competition from potential holders of enslaved people in the new territory, and the effects that would have on the prices of staple crops such as tobacco. They correctly predicted that enslavement would be permitted south of the Ohio River under the Southwest Ordinance of 1790, and therefore did not view this as a threat to enslavement. In terms of the actual law, it did not ban enslavement in practice, and it continued almost until the start of the Civil War.

King's phrasing from the 1785 attempt was incorporated in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 when it was enacted on 13 July 1787. Article 6 has the provision for freedom seekers:

Art. 6. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: Provided, always, That any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.

Fugitive Slave Act of 1793
When Congress created ""An Act respecting fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from the service of their masters"", or more commonly known as the Fugitive Slave Act, they were responding to slave owners' need to protect their property rights, as written into the 1787 Constitution. Article IV of the Constitution required the federal government to go after runaway slaves. The 1793 Fugitive Slave Act was the mechanism by which the government did that, and it was only at this point the government could pursue runaway slaves in any state or territory, and ensure slave owners of their property rights.

Section 3 is the part that deals with fugitive or runaway slaves, and reads in part:

SEC. 3. ... That when a person held to labor in any of the United States, or of the Territories on the Northwest or South of the river Ohio ... shall escape into any other part of the said States or Territory, the person to whom such labor or service may be due ... is hereby empowered to seize or arrest such fugitive from labor ... and upon proof ... before any Judge ... it shall be the duty of such Judge ... [to remove] the said fugitive from labor to the State or Territory from which he or she fled.

Section 4 makes assisting runaways and fugitives a crime and outlines the punishment for those who assisted runaway slaves:

SEC. 4. ... That any person who shall knowingly and willingly obstruct or hinder such claimant ... shall ... forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars.

High demand for slaves in the Deep South and the hunt for fugitives caused free blacks to be at risk of being kidnapped and sold into slavery, despite having ""free"" papers. Many people who were legally free and had never been slaves were captured and brought south to be sold into slavery. The historian Carol Wilson documented 300 such cases in Freedom at Risk (1994) and estimated there were likely thousands of others.

In the early 19th century, personal liberty laws were passed to hamper officials in the execution of the law, but this was mostly after the abolition of the Slave Trade, as there had been very little support for abolition prior; Indiana in 1824 and Connecticut in 1828 provided jury trial for fugitives who appealed from an original decision against them. In 1840, New York and Vermont extended the right of trial by jury to fugitives and provided them with attorneys. As early as the first decade of the 19th century, individual dissatisfaction with the law of 1793 had taken the form of systematic assistance rendered to African Americans escaping from the South to Canada or New England: the so-called Underground Railroad.

The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Prigg v. Pennsylvania in 1842 (16 Peters 539)—that state authorities could not be forced to act in fugitive slave cases, but that national authorities must carry out the national law—was followed by legislation in Massachusetts (1843), Vermont (1843), Pennsylvania (1847) and Rhode Island (1848), forbidding state officials from aiding in enforcing the law and refusing the use of state jails for fugitive slaves.

1850 Fugitive Slave Act

The demand from the South for more effective Federal legislation was voiced in the second fugitive slave law, drafted by Senator James Murray Mason of Virginia, grandson of George Mason, and enacted on September 18, 1850, as a part of the Compromise of 1850. Special commissioners were to have concurrent jurisdiction with the U.S. circuit and district courts and the inferior courts of territories in enforcing the law; fugitives could not testify in their own behalf; no trial by jury was provided.

Penalties were imposed upon marshals who refused to enforce the law or from whom a fugitive should escape, and upon individuals who aided black people to escape; the marshal might raise a posse comitatus; a fee of $10 ($ in today's dollars) was paid to the commissioner when his decision favored the claimant, only $5 ($ in today's dollars)  when it favored the fugitive.  The supposed justification for the disparity in compensation was that, if the decision were in favor of the claimant, additional effort on the part of the commissioner would be required in order to fill out the paperwork actually remanding the slave back to the South. Both the fact of the escape and the identity of the fugitive were determined on purely ex parte testimony. If a slave was brought in and returned to the master, the person who brought in the slave would receive the sum of $10 ($ in today's dollars) per slave.

The severity of this measure led to gross abuses and defeated its purpose; the number of abolitionists increased, the operations of the Underground Railroad became more efficient, and new personal liberty laws were enacted in Vermont (1850), Connecticut (1854), Rhode Island (1854), Massachusetts (1855), Michigan (1855), Maine (1855 and 1857), Kansas (1858) and Wisconsin (1858). The personal liberty laws forbade justices and judges to take cognizance of claims, extended habeas corpus and the privilege of jury trial to fugitives, and punished false testimony severely. In 1854, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin went so far as to declare the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional.

These state laws were one of the grievances that South Carolina would later use to justify its secession from the Union. Attempts to carry into effect the law of 1850 aroused much bitterness. The arrests of Thomas Sims and of Shadrach Minkins in Boston in 1851; of Jerry M. Henry, in Syracuse, New York, in the same year; of Anthony Burns in 1854, in Boston; and of the two Garner families in 1856, in Cincinnati, with other cases arising under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, probably had as much to do with bringing on the Civil War as did the controversy over slavery in the Territories.

Civil War-era legal status of fugitive slaves

With the beginning of the Civil War, the legal status of the slave was changed by his masters being in arms. Benjamin Franklin Butler, in May 1861, declared black slaves are contraband of war. The Confiscation Act of 1861 was passed in August 1861, and discharged from service or labor any slave employed in aiding or promoting any insurrection against the government of the United States.

By the congressional Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves of March 13, 1862, any slave of a disloyal master who was in territory occupied by Northern troops was declared ipso facto free. But for some time the Fugitive Slave Law was considered still to hold in the case of fugitives from masters in the border states who were loyal to the Union government, and it was not until June 28, 1864, that the Act of 1850 was fully repealed.

Voters chose seven representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.

Vermont voted for the Anti-Masonic Party candidate, William Wirt, over the National Republican candidate, Henry Clay, and the Democratic Party candidate, Andrew Jackson. Vermont was the only state in the country that Wirt carried in 1832, by a margin of 6.08%. As of 2017, Wirt's performance remains the best-ever by a third-party Presidential candidate in any Northeastern state, constitutes the solitary occasion a third-party candidate has carried any New England state, and the only time a person from Maryland has ever won an electoral vote for the Presidency from pledged electors. (Spiro Agnew of Maryland would in 1968 and 1972 win the electoral vote for the vice presidency.) 

While Vermont was the only state that voted for Wirt, it would only prove to be his second strongest in terms of popular vote percentage, the first being Pennsylvania with 42.04 percentage points.

The car was driven by Jarno Trulli and Jenson Button. The chassis was designed by Mike Gascoyne, Bob Bell, Tim Densham and John Iley with Pat Symonds overseeing the design and production of the car as Executive Director of Engineering and Jean-Jacques His leading the engine design.

Renault returned to F1 as a team after they last competed in 1985. When Renault first entered F1, the one part of the car that stood out was the engine; Renault pioneered turbo engines in F1. In 2002 the engine was special again; with a V angle of about 111 degrees, it was over 20 degrees wider than the competitors' engines. This wider V angle resulted in a lower centre of gravity, improving the car's handling. The wide-angle engine had been introduced the previous season in the Benetton B201, and a season of development had ironed out the teething problems its predecessor had suffered from.

The team finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship with 23 points, an impressive result for the team's first season and paving the way for their future success.

Renault used 'Mild Seven' logos, except at the British and French Grands Prix.

615,23376273,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester%20%28Jamaica%29%20Local%20Sustainable%20Development%20Plan,Manchester (Jamaica) Local Sustainable Development Plan,"The Manchester Local Sustainable Development Plan was prepared by the Manchester Parish Council (MPC) and the Manchester Parish Development Committee (MPDC), located in Mandeville, Jamaica, in Manchester Parish, and publicly presented to the community in July 2007. The Development Plan was completed after a thorough process of participation and citizen’s mobilization that took five years. This document is the first of its kind in the country and in the English speaking Caribbean. The Plan is based on the principles of community driven development, bottom-up democracy and local capacity building to achieve sustainable development.

The Plan is also part of the Local Government Reform initiatives, a national effort that seeks to decentralize certain government functions. The local planning approach follows in line with the tenets of Local Agenda 21, the global initiative to improve governance and quality of life at the community level. The plan also recognizes the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. The preparation of the plan involved different development agencies, local, national and international, and it is proposed as a model for this kind of developmental approach.

Goals and Actions
The Plan was written to provide the Parish with proposed goals, objectives, actions, policy recommendation and implementation strategies inspired by the local residents’ visions that were gathered from a series of stakeholders meetings, community workshops and researches. This Local Sustainable Development Plan aims for a twenty-year multi-sectoral approach or collaboration between a myriad of sectors that will help to guide and achieve sustainable development and long-term planning for the region.

In terms of objectives, the Plan seeks to address the challenges experienced by the Parish as a whole in pertinent areas that includes housing provision, traffic congestion, waste generation, water shortage, education and the creation of economic opportunities. The plan therefore explores relevant issues such as Land Use Designations, Housing, Transportation, Waste Management, The Natural Environment, Energy, Water, Mining, Tourism, Agriculture, Social Services and Community participation and Local Governance, with regard to the principles of sustainability.

Manchester’s plan begin with a comprehensive vision for the future that clearly expresses that “the citizens of the parish imagine a future in which Manchester is known as a great place to live, work, play and learn, with lively and attractive towns, strong communities, and a scenic countryside.”

Preparation of the Plan
The preparation of the plan has followed a systematic process. Each stage of planning, from building partnership to evaluation, builds upon the previous. Yet, because the plan must be updated, the process is also cyclical. As the plan is implemented, changing political priorities and local realities could mean that the Parish must adjust its course in order to achieve its vision.

The stages in the process were as follows:

1. Building and strengthening partnership. The PDC began by forming relationship with key agencies and individuals. Strengthening these partnerships has continued throughout the planning process.

2. Gathering community information. Community workshops engaged residents in collecting information on local geography, history, culture and economy.

3. Parish Profile. The Plan, completed and published in April 2004, is a comprehensive compilation of information containing almost everything one would need to know about the Parish.

4. Community Planning Workshops. Interactive workshops were held in communities across the Parish, in which citizens discussed issues concerning their communities and formulated visions for the future.

5. Sector Work Groups. Work groups were composed of experts and policy makers in specific fields like agriculture, infrastructure, mining and environment. Through a series of meetings, these groups discussed possible solutions for the challenges facing their sector.

6. Draft 1 of the Plan. The first Draft of Manchester’s plan was released in 2006 and is based on information from the community workshops and sectors work groups.

7. Stakeholder Meetings. Conversations with stakeholders further refined the direction of the plan.

8. Draft 2. The second draft of the plan presents a comprehensive vision and complete set of recommendations.

9. Land Use Survey. The data was used to analyse the current pattern of land use and provided assistance for policy development and land use proposals in the Manchester LSDP.

10. Community and Stakeholder Engagement. Workshops with communities and stakeholders will give everyone a chance to review Draft 2 and influence the final draft.

11. Final Plan. Responding to community and stakeholders input, the final draft will be the one to be implemented by all the various actors.

12. Monitoring and Evaluation. The Parish will need to monitor and evaluate its progress toward its vision. The plan should be updated every five years or so.

Fundamental Principles of the Document
Manchester approach to the plan is based on these fundamental principles:

- The ultimate goal is sustainability. Manchester must provide for the present while ensuring a better quality of life for the future through proper management of its resources. This requires considering the connections between environmental, social, and economic forces.

- The plan must belong to the citizens. The intent of the plan is to improve the lives of residents. The plan will only be effectively if citizens are central in its creation and implementation.

- The plan should take a long-term and global perspective as well as a twenty-year, local perspective. The Parish must consider the entire range of relevant issues, from global trends to local realities. Likewise, the Parish must aim for short-term improvement while also looking much further into the future.

- Manchester can use growth and change to its advantage. The citizens of Manchester welcome to wealth brought by development, but they realise that growth can present challenges. The Parish must therefore learn to take advantage of the opportunities created by change.

The resulting plan follows these principles while responding to the changing environmental, economic, and developmental forces that continue to shape the region.

The vision of the community
Manchester’s vision encompasses four main themes, which form the framework for the plan.

1. Cool, Clean and Green. The Parish will preserve its natural resources while building upon its cool climate, attractive environment and green vistas.

2. Growing and Diversifying the Economy. The Parish will grow by taking advantages of new economic opportunities in creative ways.

3. Creating strong and vibrant communities. The Parish’s communities will be desirable place to live, where civic pride and community spirit is sustained for generations to come.

4. Responsible and Creative use of space. The Parish will promote sustainable development and good design that leads to wise use of land.

The plan's more relevant elements
The principal issues and chapters covered by the documents were:

- The Natural Environment: Cool, Clean, Green. The natural conditions and resources which Manchester has to work with. Conserving the natural environment, including land, water and mineral resources, protecting tourist areas and greening rural and urban communities;

- The Social and Cultural Environment: Creating Strong and Vibrant Communities. The needs for housing, education, health, safety, and other social and community needs and a protected and enhanced cultural heritage;

- The Economic Development Element: Growing and Diversifying the Economy. This part focuses on improving the productivity of traditional industries (Agriculture, Mining, Tourism) and building new industries that capitalize on opportunities as Manchester's strength in education and responses to climate change;

- The Built Environment: Responsible and Creative use of Space. Aims to accommodate and achieve the social and economic requirements presented in the other chapters. It covers land use, transportation, housing and urban design, water, waste management, energy, security and other aspects of infrastructure and utilities.

616,49243443,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien%3A%20The%20Illustrated%20Story,Alien: The Illustrated Story,"Alien: The Illustrated Story or simply Alien, (stylized as ALIEN) is a sixty-four page critically acclaimed graphic novel adaptation of the 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien published by Heavy Metal magazine in 1979. It was scripted by Archie Goodwin and drawn by Walt Simonson. It is the first comic from the Alien franchise and one of few of the franchises comic publications which is not associated with the long-lasting Aliens line from Dark Horse Comics. The book was a major critical and commercial success and was the first comic to ever be listed on the New York Times Bestsellers list.

Development

Plot
The plot of the graphic novel follows that of the theatrical film, with minor differences.

Reception

Sales
The book was a major success and appeared on the New York Times Mass Market bestseller list (the first comic to ever do so) for eight weeks between July and September 1979, reaching as high as number seven on the list. The book was featured on the list decades before the graphic novel-specific list was created for the New York Times. The book was a rare high-seller for the comic industry in the year 1979 since sales were very down at that point. Of the success of the book artist Walter Simonson expressed that he did not deserve much of the credit he had been given, stating ""it was Alien. Anybody could have done it and [made it a best-seller].""

Critical response
The New York Times' review of the book called it ""an eye-filling and vibrant graphic portrayal of the gripping and fantastic tale that is Alien."" Frank Plowright of The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide expressed that the book remains Heavy Metal's best home-grown work.

Comics writer Warren Ellis named Alien: The Illustrated Story as ""the single best adaptation of film into comics ever,"" calling it ""a stunning piece of work, hugely progressive and innovative.""

Comic Book Resources (CBR) covered the re-issued edition of the book in a number of articles. Timothy Callahan's review included this analysis: ""Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson crafted a little near-perfect slice of cinema in graphic novel form back in 1979, and they did it by using all the tricks at their disposal."" In a detailed analysis of Simonson's art, Greg Burgas characterized Alien: The Illustrated Story as ""a really nice book on its own, in some ways better than the movie."" And in his rundown of the 15 best Xenomorph comics, Michael Holland of CBR listed Alien: The Illustrated Story as #3, calling it a ""must-read"" and calling out the few scenes that showed events from the film from a different perspective.

Scott Collura of IGN praised the work of Goodwin and Simonson, citing ""Goodwin's lean adaptation of the screenplay"" and his ability to ""trim bits and pieces to keep the comic moving at a brisk, readable pace, but it never feels like anything has really been cut."" Of Simonson, he wrote ""the artwork itself is beautiful (in an alien ripping your head open kind of way). . . ,"" calling it ""ornate and detailed"" and going on to write, ""But the art is also rough and tough at times, which is certainly in keeping with the 'truckers in space' story. It's not uncommon to turn the page and discover another stunning layout: a double-splash page of the Space Jockey's ship. . . .""

Lee Pfeiffer of Cinema Retro praised the book, writing that it ""does an admirable job of compacting all of the key story elements without resorting to the kinds of 'artistic license' that often compromise many other comic adaptations of films,"" and calling the artwork ""ground-breaking."" Brett Chittenden of Geek Hard praised the book as well, noting ""the pacing seems a little different but never in a bad way. It’s very much like Ridley Scott shot his film and then Goodwin and Simonson came in and re-shot the entire film with the same actors and sets and without seeing Scott’s version. And it works really well.""

Scott VanderPloeg of AE Index praised the ""Original Art Edition"" of the book, citing the extras: ""a signature plate with Simonson’s in pencil, complete script, colouring examples, an in-depth interview and an afterword by Simonson,"" and calling it ""a bargain at $75.""

Kevin Church of ComicsAlliance reviewed the book positively, calling it the fifth-best comic book adaptation of a film, and noting that:

Art analysis
The work has been highly praised for its art. Dr. Jan Baetens and Dr. Hugo Frey, the authors of the book The Graphic Novel: An Introduction, asserts that Alien: The Illustrated Story's art by Simonson has a distinctive format, particularly the panel and page layout, which serves to provide the audience with a careful and cohesively shaped work which highlights the tension in the plot (as well as for the characters) and brings them to greater attention to the readers. According to Baetens and Frey, Simonson achieves this by utilizing standard comic frames, but then subtly breaking the images outside of the panels and organizing the pages into a more ""free-form"" style. In contrast to another acclaimed graphic novel, A Contract with God by Will Eisner, so are more traditional grid panels still present at places but are frequently reduced or are abandoned altogether as the story progresses. In their opinion, so does the characters and backgrounds without framing lend the work a confidence and readability that is impressive. Comparing it again to A Contract with God they express that Simonson's highly planned-out but simultaneously free-flowing approach similarly prepares for three double splash pages of major scenes from the story.

Fellow comic book artist Chris Sprouse has praised Simonson's work on the book and stated that the copy he owns had a place of honor in his comic collection in his youth. Sprouse expressed that he loved Simonson work with the technology portrayed in the comic, which he described as accurate, and that he appreciated that Simonson put effort into making the story visually exciting, as opposed to many other movie-tie-in comics that Sprouse had read. Sprouse cited Simonson's work as his greatest inspiration, together with that of Frank Miller. Similarly, cartoonist Kyle Baker said that Alien: The Illustrated Edition was the only comics-format film adaptation he ever liked.

Legacy
Walt Simonson would later participate in the making of a parody of Alien: The Illustrated Story in the pages of Howard the Duck, in a story named SNAILIAN, which features a snail in the roles of the Alien creature as it menaces Howard.

624,4168395,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry%20Harvey,Gerry Harvey,"Gerry Harvey (born 18 September 1939) is an Australian entrepreneur best known for being the executive chairman of Harvey Norman Holdings, a company which runs Australian retail chain Harvey Norman. He co-founded it with Ian Norman in 1982.

Biography
Harvey was born in rural New South Wales and attended school at Bathurst and Katoomba before moving to Sydney to go to university when he was 17, but he dropped out. He got his start early, selling vacuum cleaners and fridges door-to-door for Goodwins of Newtown. When he was younger, Harvey was determined to be a farmer.

Harvey first met Ian Norman while both were working as door-to-door vacuum salesmen. They partnered to open their first store in Sydney in 1961. The chain, which was called Norman Ross, expanded to forty-two stores with annual sales of 240 million by 1979. This company was sold in 1982 to firstly Grace Bros. for $23 million, then was onsold to Alan Bond's Walton Bond company.  After that transaction was completed, Harvey was sacked via order from Alan Bond by John Walton. This action was spoken about in Harvey's first ad for his next venture. Harvey, with Ian Norman as a silent partner, started Harvey Norman that same year through its first store in Auburn, NSW. It then expanded and now owns the retailers Domayne, and Joyce Mayne, along with numerous other, smaller businesses. Harvey adopts a very hands-on approach to his business, appearing as a spokesman during radio adverts for Harvey Norman. He frequently gives comment on economic and business matters in the national press and television media and has a sizeable public profile. He is generally regarded as a slightly maverick businessman and is often critical of Australian CEOs, particularly when it comes to remuneration. He often states that no one is worth the millions they earn and that if they think they are worth more, they can be paid in options and shares.

In January 2011, Harvey was embroiled in a widely condemned campaign backed by a number of bricks and mortar Australian retailers to scrap tax rules that allow Australians to shop on overseas websites without paying GST. In response to the campaign, the Federal Government asked the Productivity Commission to investigate and report on the retail industry. Harvey subsequently said the report is a waste of time and money, and did not read it.

Thoroughbred business interests
Over the last decade he has become increasingly involved with breeding with race horses, and he owns Baramul Stud. Harvey has one of the world's largest thoroughbred portfolio, with over 600 thoroughbreds in his stables. He also owns 50% of Magic Millions, one of the largest and most expensive thoroughbred auction events in the Australian racing industry.

Personal life
Harvey has two children with his first wife, Lynette. He remarried to Katie Page in 1988; they have two children. In 1999, Page became the CEO of Harvey Norman.

In an interview in 2008, he described giving charity to the homeless as ""a waste"", and said that it was ""helping a whole heap of no-hopers to survive for no good reason"". He later claimed the comments were taken out of context and he did give money to homeless charities, among others.

In 2016, Harvey expressed contempt for what he saw as political uncertainty since John Howard left office, and said the only solution is ""to have a dictator like in China"".

Net worth 
In 2014, the Business Review Weekly (BRW) assessed Harvey's net worth at 1.55 billion; an increase of 9 million on the 2013 BRW Rich 200 list. From 2013 up to and including 2020, the BRW/Financial Review assessed Harvey's wealth as an individual. From 2021, the Financial Review assessed the combined net worth of Harvey and Page jointly.

625,22730409,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas%20%28literary%20magazine%29,Bananas (literary magazine),"Bananas was a British literary magazine that ran for 26 issues from January 1975 until April 1981. It was initially published and edited by the novelist Emma Tennant but from autumn 1979  was published and edited by the poet Abigail Mozley. Tennant chose to name the magazine after the motion picture Bananas (1971), directed by Woody Allen.

Quality and innovation helped to distinguish Bananas, but the magazine also appeared in an unusual format, that of a tabloid newspaper. Tennant believed this lent Bananas’ literary content more immediacy and addressed the readership's appetite for culture in a contemporary media form. Tennant has said, “Bananas had a long-term effect on British literary audiences by taking the word ‘Review’ away from the concept of a literary magazine and insisting on original fiction; it insisted too on wit and jokes and irreverence.”

Contributors to Bananas included Angela Carter (who originally wrote the short story ""The Company of Wolves"" for the magazine), Heathcote Williams, Ruth Fainlight and Ted Hughes. Work by Claud Cockburn, Beryl Bainbridge, Harold Pinter, Sara Maitland, Bruce Chatwin, Peter Wollen and Philip Roth also featured. Several writers strongly associated with the speculative fiction magazine New Worlds found themselves welcomed to Bananas’ convention-challenging approach. Tom Disch and John Sladek were among these and J. G. Ballard was both a contributing editor and a constant presence, providing a short story for each issue.

The design of the magazine was created by Julian Rothenstein (subsequently founder of the art book publishing company Redstone Press) and was a considerable part of its character. One influence on Bananas’ format was Interview, the New York City magazine founded by Andy Warhol. In 1979 Emma Tennant’s nephew, Charles Tennant, was inspired by both publications to launch a short-lived literary nightlife tabloid entitled Chelsea Scoop.

The editorial office of Bananas was 2 Blenheim Crescent in Notting Hill Gate. In the 1970s this address was at the hub of much of London’s alternative and radical literary activity. Adjacent offices to Bananas housed the team that created An Index of Possibilities (a UK response to the American Whole Earth Catalogue), Frendz magazine, International Times (IT) and The Open Head Press. Michael Moorcock, editor of New Worlds, was also a neighbour.

The history of Bananas is related in Tennant’s 1999 autobiographical book, Burnt Diaries. In this, the magazine’s struggles and successes are set in the context of Notting Hill Gate’s most prolific literary bohemian and countercultural era and against the background of Tennant’s relationship with Ted Hughes.

An anthology of work from the magazine, also titled Bananas, was published in 1977.

626,3840590,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway%20Warrior,Freeway Warrior,"Freeway Warrior is a series of 4 gamebooks, created by Joe Dever. The books were published between 1988 and 1989, detailing the complete story of a band of nuclear holocaust survivors as they flee Texas to the relative safety of California. In 2016, a Swedish company, Åskfågeln, started reprints.

The reader plays the role of Cal Phoenix, the titular Freeway Warrior, as he scouts a safe route for the rag-tag convoy of survivors on their journey to California.

Timeline
 2011: Seventeen 100-kiloton nuclear warheads are stolen by HAVOC – The Hijack, Assassination and Violent Opposition Consortium.
 New Years Day, 2012: The stolen warheads are smuggled into major cities around the globe.  An ultimatum is issued: Unless a £2 trillion ransom is paid and all HAVOC agents being held prisoner released then the warheads will be detonated one by one.
 January 2, 2012: The world government refuses to cooperate; Paris, France is destroyed.
 January 3, 2012: The World Defense League retaliates by attacking HAVOC's command headquarters and killing the inhabitants.  Unknown to them, a failsafe is activated and the remaining warheads are detonated.  A disastrous chain reaction results, feeding on civil and military nuclear installations all across the northern hemisphere. The world as we know it ends...
 2012–2019: Hundreds of millions of people are killed within days, and many more perish during the years that follow, falling victim to the radioactivity and the severe climatic changes that affect the earth.
 2019–2020: Radiation decays to tolerable levels, climate returns to normal and survivors emerge to reclaim what little remains of the world they once knew.

Prelude
On the eventful day, Cal Phoenix was visiting his Uncle's oil-shale mine near Austin, Texas.  The mine shielded Cal from the explosions, along with his Aunt and Uncle.  Unfortunately they were left trapped underground.  They had sufficient supplies to survive, but it took eight long years to tunnel to the surface.  When they finally broke through, the world had changed forever.

Cal, Uncle Jonas and Aunt Betty-Ann managed to make radio contact with a colony of survivors near the ruins of McKinney. This colony grew over time, becoming Dallas Colony One (DC1), one of the few safe havens in Texas.

DC1 began entering troubled times; the water supply was drying up, leaving them with no alternative but to abandon their safe haven and attempt to relocate.  Rumours had been heard that California survived virtually intact, so the decision was made to head West, towards California.

List of books
 Highway Holocaust (1988)
 Slaughter Mountain Run (1989)
 The Omega Zone (1989)
 California Countdown (1989)

Game Mechanics
While based on the Lone Wolf system (e.g.,  random number tables, combat results tables, etc.) a further level of complexity is added, making for a deeper experience:
Skill sets are introduced (including, driving, stealth, shooting) which are often tested for outcomes. These vary and can be increased from book-to-book if the complete series is played (in a similar fashion to the Kai Disciplines in Lone Wolf). One of the most important details is that the more you carry, the more your stealth reduces.
Ranged combat is as important as close combat and a variety of different weapons, with differing characteristics are available.
In addition to meals, water and ammo are monitored.

Notes
Highway Holocaust and Slaughter Mountain Run were initially released as Freeway Warrior 1 and Mountain Run respectively in the United States since the original titles were deemed too violent.  Later releases used the official titles.
These books were published after the Fighting Fantasy book #13, Freeway Fighter (1985) which also involved driving a modified car in a similarly post-apocalypse world. However, the FF Book was more combat oriented and less character-based, as well as featuring game statistics for the actual motor vehicle.
 The books were reprinted in the 2010s by Åskfågeln with new cover art by Lukas Thelin.

627,29659549,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherborne%20Sensors,Sherborne Sensors,"Sherborne Sensors is a designer and manufacturer of precision inclinometers, accelerometers and load cells. Technologies utilized include mechanical servo, solid state and strain gauge.  These precision measurement tools are available as both off-the-shelf and bespoke for use in military, aerospace, civil and industrial engineering applications.

Sherborne Sensors is based in ‘transducer valley’ in Hampshire, UK, and supplies its products to over 50 countries across the world.

Many of the inertial products currently offered have evolved from the Schaevitz brand that innovated sensor design during the 1940s and 1950s. The current LSOC/LSOP range of Linear Servo Inclinometers originate from the genuine Schaevitz units. The Force Transducers have their roots with the Maywood brand founded in the 1970s.

History 

Sherborne Sensors began life in 1945 as Schaevitz Engineering, a New Jersey-based manufacturer of LVDTs and other precision sensors. The business operated solely in the USA until an association formed with Electro-Mechanisms (EM) in 1963. This allowed their products to be distributed in the UK and also to be manufactured under licence.

Prompted by the success overseas, Schaevitz Engineering acquired the majority shareholding in EM and began manufacturing a UK range of inertial products in 1974.

The Schaevitz name traded until 1986 when the company was acquired by Lucas who changed the name of the business to Lucas Control Systems.

In 1997 the company became Lucas Varty  and in 1999 was acquired by TRW. Throughout all of this time the Schaevitz brand remained strong and at the cutting edge of sensors technologies.

This business model continued until August 2000 when the Schaevitz Sensors and Components division of TRW was acquired by Measurement Specialities Inc (MSI). In 2002 the Measurement Specialties UK group was put into financial receivership and its assets sold. A group of former Schaevitz employees purchased the Inertial Products Division from MSI and formed the Sherborne Sensors Limited Company in July 2002 thus continuing the design, development and manufacture of precision sensors.

In 2007, Sherborne Sensors extended its product range beyond inertial sensors by obtaining the former Maywood Instruments force transducer product lines and intellectual property from FTSA Holdings Limited.

Following this expansion, Sherborne Sensors has extended its operation globally, establishing a sales and stocking location in North American in 2009.

629,45097662,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Few%20Not%20Fleeting,The Few Not Fleeting,"The Few Not Fleeting is the third studio album by American rock band Nothing More.  It was released on February 21, 2009 through Vestia Entertainment. It is notable for being the first album featuring Jonny Hawkins as the lead vocalist, who previously served as the band's drummer.

Background

While often seen as Nothing More's first studio album due to the lack of availability of prior releases, it is actually the band's third studio album. Tracing back the band's origins, band member Jonny Hawkins began playing drums as early as the seventh grade, which is around the time he met guitarist Mark Vollelunga, by hearing him play guitar at a church camp. The two became friends, and would hold informal jam sessions together with other students throughout their middle and high school years. In 2003, Hawkins and Vollelunga officially formed the band, with core member and bassist Daniel Oliver joining in 2004.

Around the end of high school, the band began recording music and touring locally, which they did for years, plagued by lineup changes and the inability to garner a contract from record label.  In 2004, the band released the more funk-influenced album Shelter with vocalist Josh Klaus and second guitarist Josh Kercheville. Klaus left and was replaced by Travis Cox, who recorded the EP Madhatter's Bliss in 2005. A compilation album, Vandura, largely consisting of containing of the tracks from the first two releases, was also released in 2006. Cox was later replaced by singer Trey Graham, who had previously toured with Kelly Clarkson. The band found some form of success in the release, releasing the album Save You/Save Me in 2007 and touring with Thirty Seconds to Mars and getting on to The Warped Tour, but ultimately felt unhappy with the compromise of moving in a more pop, mainstream influence from Graham, and parted ways with the singer. Around the same time, Kercheville left the band as well, leaving the band as a trio.

Writing and recording
By mid-2008, the band was at a crossroads. Hawkins began struggling with depression, due to a number of personal issues, ranging from his mother's diagnosis, and death, from cancer, the end of a five year romantic relationship, and stress from turnover in band membership. Additionally, the band had won a ""battle of the bands"" contest prior to losing Graham and Kercheville, but collecting the prize money and instruments they had won required them to perform a showcase in front of record label executives. Feeling a drastic change was in order, Hawkins decided, after over 8 years as the band's drummer, to instead become the band's frontman and lead vocalist.  While the performance, having Hawkins do drums and vocals concurrently, did not go over well, his instinct was that this was the correct direction for the band to pursue ultimately. Despite Hawkins lack of formal experience in singing, and even general fear of public speaking, he garnered the support of remaining members Vollelunga and Oliver, and the band pushed forward, opting to use fill-in temporary drummers for live performances moving forward. The members saw this as a new beginning for the band, and later even removed the prior recording from any sort of retail space, feeling it no longer represented the band.

Throughout 2008 and early 2009, the band worked on recording their first album with Hawkins as the lead vocalist, which would eventually be titled The Few Not Fleeting. Hawkins largely drew from the aforementioned personal issues for lyrical material on the album, and it largely being created by the core trio, the band was able to delve farther into their preferred music stylings, which was more of a progressive rock, alternative rock, and hard rock direction than prior releases. The album recorded in Hawkins' home studio, allowing the band to not be constrained money or time restraints in the studio, which in turn improved the release's overall sound quality as well.

Release and promotion
The album was released on February 21, 2009. The band toured in support of the album for two years.

633,45287596,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traian%20Bratu,Traian Bratu,"Traian Bratu (October 25, 1875 – July 21, 1940) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian scholar of German language and literature. A native of the Mărginimea Sibiului region in Transylvania, he left for the Romanian Old Kingdom, where he attended university, followed up by a doctorate at the University of Berlin. In 1907, he became a professor at the University of Iași, where he taught until his death; over time, his research interests gradually shifted from literature to linguistics. Meanwhile, he fought in World War I and twice led his university in the postwar period: in the early 1920s and during the 1930s. A left-leaning member of the National Peasants' Party, he was president of the Romanian Senate from 1928 to 1931. He actively opposed the far right, clashing with the followers of A. C. Cuza and with the Iron Guard; the latter organization made two unsuccessful attempts on his life.

Biography

Origins and academic pursuits
Born in Rășinari, Sibiu County, in the Mărginimea Sibiului area of Transylvania, at the time part of Austria-Hungary, he grew up in a peasant family. He attended primary school in his native village, followed by the Hungarian-language state high school in Sibiu. Right after finishing high school in 1894, he left for the Romanian Old Kingdom, without emigration papers. There, he studied literature at the University of Bucharest and graduated in 1898. He then taught German at a gymnasium and a seminary in Râmnicu Vâlcea between 1900 and 1902, after which he moved to the National College in Iași. There, his subjects were German and Latin, and he remained on the faculty until 1916.

Subsequently, he specialized in German studies at the University of Berlin from 1902 to 1907, earning a doctorate on the lyric poetry of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué. In October 1907, he was hired as a professor of Germanistics at Iași University in the Moldavia region; he would hold this post until his death. Initially a lecturer, he rose to associate professor in 1913 and full professor in 1916. In 1909, he married Erika Schmidt, who was German-Jewish.

At first, his academic interest tended toward literature; a volume on German language and literature in Romanian universities appeared in 1908. He was very active over the next few years, publishing a study of classical German poetry in 1909 and an analysis of Ernst Zahn's work in 1912. Moreover, in 1905, he had written a study of Friedrich Schiller's fragmentary play about Perkin Warbeck. He sent a work on the reception of popular German books to a conference at Leipzig University; this would appear in volume form in 1936. Later, his interests shifted toward linguistics. He finished a study of word order in Low German in 1934, published in Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur in mid-1938. Karl Kurt Klein, a Transylvanian Saxon, was a collaborator of his at Iași from 1923; together, the two devised a new method for teaching German.

Wartime service and university administration
Although an avowed admirer of Germany, Bratu was a second lieutenant in the Romanian Land Forces, and when his country entered World War I on the side of the Allies in 1916, he served with distinction on the front. He initially saw action in August in Dobruja, after which he was advanced to the rank of lieutenant. He then fought in Moldavia, at Oituz and on the Trotuș River valley. He was demobilized in May 1918, and looked with scorn upon his pro-Allied colleagues Ioan Ursu, Oreste Tafrali and Ion Găvănescul, who spent the war in Paris advocating on Romania's behalf. After their return from France, he would clash with the latter two, who pushed for dismissing Ilie Bărbulescu from the faculty due to his ""unpatriotic attitude"". Together with faculty colleagues Garabet Ibrăileanu, Dimitrie Gusti and Ion Petrovici, Bratu displayed left-wing tendencies in the war's aftermath.

Following the creation of Greater Romania in 1918, he advocated a melting pot approach toward the country's ethnic minorities, which would respect their civic rights and ensure their loyalty. This position brought him into conflict with A. C. Cuza and his disciples. He became dean of the Iași literature faculty in October 1920, and served as university rector twice: from October 1921 to December 1922 and from December 1932 to June 1938. His first term as rector ended with his resignation: an anti-Semitic student movement had gripped the university, and when protesters continued to block Jewish students from entering its buildings, he quit in protest at government inaction. His interim successor, as the most senior dean, was his nemesis Cuza.

Political involvement and later years
Bratu was a member of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) from March 1928. He represented his university in the Romanian Senate, serving as the body's president from 1928 to 1931. He held this office following the landslide PNȚ victory in the 1928 election, which produced the first Parliament led by that party. In 1932, he was again elected senator, this time representing Baia County. He opposed political extremism, particularly as embodied by the Iron Guard. This led to two attempts on his life, in 1936 and 1937; the latter attack left him with an earlobe cut off.

He died of lung cancer in Bucharest, although official historiography under the communist regime would assert his demise was brought on by the Guardist attacks.

History
The Fylde constituency was originally formed for the 1918 general election, but was abolished for the 1950 general election, when it was split into Fylde North and Fylde South. For the 1983 general election those two constituencies were merged to form a new Fylde constituency.
 
The seat was reduced in the boundary review leading to the 2010 United Kingdom general election, losing most of its elements from the Borough of Wyre and the City of Preston to the new seat of Wyre and Preston North.

Boundaries

1918–1945: The Urban Districts of Fleetwood, Kirkham, Longridge, Poulton-le-Fylde, Thornton, and Walton-le-Dale, the Rural District of Preston, and part of the Rural District of Fylde.

1945–1950: Part of the County Borough of Preston; the Municipal Borough of Fleetwood; the Urban Districts of Kirkham, Longridge, Poulton-le-Fylde, Thornton Cleveleys, Walton-le-Dale, and part of Fulwood; and, the Rural District of Fylde, and parts of Blackburn, and Preston.

1983–1997: The Borough of Fylde, and the Borough of Preston ward of Preston Rural West.

1997–2010: The Borough of Fylde, the Borough of Preston wards of Ingol and Preston Rural West, and the Borough of Wyre ward of Great Eccleston.

2010–present: The Borough of Fylde, and the City of Preston ward of Lea.

The constituency has three main population centres, namely Kirkham/Wesham, Lytham St Annes and Freckleton. Kirkham, Wesham and Freckleton are small towns with some light industrial development and have a considerable Labour vote, but Lytham and St Annes are comfortable seaside resorts, favoured by families and retired couples, and along with the more rural parts of the seat, are safely Conservative.

638,50540412,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope%20Project,Penelope Project,"'Penelope' was the code word given to a draft text of the EU Constitution prepared for the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, in 2001. The text was named after Penelope, the wife of Odysseus in Greek Mythology, who was perpetually spinning a web which she never completed.

History 
After the creation of the European Single Currency, the European Commission decided that the EU should have a single constitution to replace the existing ad hoc system of multilateral treaties. The Convention on the Future of Europe, or the European Convention, was created by the European Council in December 2001 in order to propose a draft constitution for the European Union.

The Commission wanted to create an expanded system of Qualified Majority Voting to allow for more expediency in decision making.

In a speech in Strasbourg in May 2002, Romano Prodi stated that the proposed reforms had a further intention: 'As regards the institutions, our proposals have a clear aim: to define more clearly who does what in the European Union. In other words, who is accountable politically and institutionally for action undertaken.' (emphasis in original)

However, the European Convention did not lead to agreement on a possible Constitution. According to a 2005 review of the treaty reform process:

""Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the chair of the Praesidium, made clear at an early stage his lack of sympathy for the Commission and for its President’s ambition that it should become the government of Europe, suggesting that it had served purpose in establishing the single market.""

The European Commission presented two communications to the Convention in 2002 laying out its policy preferences for a future constitution. These communications left out discussion of the architecture of European institutions until after the 2002 Irish Referendum on the Treaty of Nice.

Prodi signalled his intention to influence the 'listening phase' of the Treaty consultations by creating the 'Penelope Group', ""a small group of senior officials to prepare a draft Constitution in secret (European Commission, 2002c), which would be submitted to the Convention in the beginning of the ‘drafting phase’.""

However, the existence of the Penelope Group led to a disagreement with Valéry Giscard D'Estaing, the chair of the Convention, who saw it as undermining his work. Secondly, ""the ‘Penelope’ draft was leaked to Le Monde and newspapers in Germany, Italy and Spain only hours before the official December document (European Commission, 2002b) was approved by the College (Norman, 2003, 165). The appearance of two texts, virtually simultaneously, seriously undermined the Commission’s credibility, even if there was little difference in their substance.""

The Penelope Project document was seen by critics as an attempt to increase the importance and power of the Commission relative to the Parliament and Council, but the final outcome of the treaty process saw the creation of the office of President of the European Union, rather than increasing the powers of the President of the Commission.

639,41910874,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg%20mechanism,Leg mechanism,"A leg mechanism (walking mechanism) is a mechanical system designed to provide a propulsive force by intermittent frictional contact with the ground.  This is in contrast with wheels or continuous tracks which are intended to maintain continuous frictional contact with the ground.  Mechanical legs are linkages that can have one or more actuators, and can perform simple planar or complex motion.  Compared to a wheel, a leg mechanism is potentially better fitted to uneven terrain, as it can step over obstacles.  

An early design for a leg mechanism called the Plantigrade Machine by Pafnuty Chebyshev was shown at the Exposition Universelle (1878).  The original engravings for this leg mechanism are available. The design of the leg mechanism for the Ohio State Adaptive Suspension Vehicle (ASV) is presented in the 1988 book Machines that Walk.  In 1996, W-B. Shieh presented a design methodology for leg mechanisms.
 
The artwork of Theo Jansen, see Jansen's linkage, has been particularly inspiring for the design of leg mechanisms, as well as the Klann patent, which is the basis for the leg mechanism of the Mondo Spider.

Design goals 
 horizontal speed as constant as possible while touching the ground (support phase)
 while the foot is not touching the ground, it should move as fast as possible
 constant torque/force input (or at least no extreme spikes/changes)
 stride height (enough for clearance, not too much to conserve energy)
 the foot has to touch the ground for at least half of the cycle for a two/four leg mechanism or respectively, a third of the cycle for a three/six leg mechanism
 minimized moving mass
 vertical center of mass always inside the base of support
 the speed of each leg or group of legs should be separately controllable for steering
 the leg mechanism should allow forward and backward walking

Another design goal can be, that stride height and length etc. can be controlled by the operator. This can relatively easily be achieved with a hydraulic leg mechanism, but is not practicable with a crank-based leg mechanism.

The optimization has to be done for the whole vehicle – ideally the force/torque variation during a rotation should cancel each other out.

History 
Richard Lovell Edgeworth tried in 1770 to construct a machine he called a ""Wooden Horse"", but was not successful.

The electoral district was created when the Electoral district of City of Adelaide was abolished in 1862 and West Adelaide and East Adelaide were created. The district of Adelaide was ultimately recreated in 1902 by the recombination of West and East Adelaide.

It was created by the Electoral Districts Act (No. 20) of the South Australian parliament in 1861 but it was not until the state election of 1862 election that candidates were first elected to represent West Adelaide. The electorate at its creation included all of the City of Adelaide (South Adelaide, North Adelaide and the Adelaide parklands) west of the centres of King William Street, Poole street, John Street and O'Connell Street.

In 1872 the area of the electorate shrunk when the Electoral district of North Adelaide was created by excising those parts of East and West Adelaide south of the River Torrens.

653,16596897,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/123rd%20Illinois%20Infantry%20Regiment,123rd Illinois Infantry Regiment,"The 123rd Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry, was an infantry and mounted infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the 123rd Illinois Volunteer Mounted Infantry Regiment, as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.

Service 
This regiment was organized at Camp Terry, Mattoon, Coles County, Illinois, by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the 7th Illinois Infantry. Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from Cumberland; E from Clark; F and G from Clark and Crawford. As a colonel in 1861, Ulysses S. Grant organized his first command, the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, in Mattoon.

Initial infantry service 

It was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of Charleston, Illinois, as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was at once put to work, under Major General William ""Bull"" Nelson, to fortify the city against Confederate General Braxton Bragg, who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General Don Carlos Buell.

On October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General William R. Terrill), Fourth Division (General James S. Jackson), in McCook's Corps, the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were ""raw recruits"".

Just 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the Battle of Perryville, where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded. Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at Munfordville, Kentucky, in November and December 1862. It has become known as the ""Battle for the Bridge,"" which began when the Union garrison led by John T. Wilder, prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the Battle of Munfordville.

The 123rd was initially assigned to the Army of the Ohio from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the Army of the Cumberland from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was William Rosecrans. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General Joseph J. Reynolds, reporting to Major General George Henry Thomas.

Conversion to mounted infantry 

In February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as ""Wilder's Lightning Brigade"" commanded by Wilder. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, Spencer repeating rifles, invented by Christopher Spencer, were adopted as the command's primary weapon.

The new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to see off numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The weapon was estimated to allow the regiment to deliver five to seven times the firepower of muzzle-loading opponents.

Tullahoma campaign 

The 123rd first used its new rifles in the Battle of Hoover's Gap. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body. Despite orders from the divisional commander, General Joseph J. Reynolds to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position.

The brigade surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap. After driving them through the gap, the brigade found it outnumbered four-to-one. The brigade entrenched and held this position.  The brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson's brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:

Chickamauga campaign 

During the calamitous Chickamauga Campaign|Tullahoma Campaign, the 123rd and the rest of the Lightning Brigade, were one of the few positive results. The 123rd was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of W.H.T. Walker's Corps. Feeling quite confident in the advantage their Spencer repeating rifles gave them, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. St. John Liddell's division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower.

At around 14:00 on 19 September, the 123rd and its brigade spoiled the left column of the main rebel attack by severely mauling both Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade and Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade. The attacking Confederates were surprised by the resolute, confident manner that the Lightning Brigade demonstrated in driving them back.

Post Chickamauga 

During the Siege of Chattanooga, the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.

During the Battle of Selma, First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.

Late in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General John Bell Hood. The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital Montgomery, Alabama.

In June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the 61st Regiment as the 123rd prepared to disband. Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L. M. Hosea and formally discharged at Springfield, Illinois, on July 11, 1865.

Total strength and casualties 
The regiment lost during service three officers and 82 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded and one officer and 133 enlisted men by disease for a total of 219.

654,36905930,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Sacriporto,Battle of Sacriporto,"The Battle of Sacriporto also called the Battle of Scariportus took place in April of 82 BC during Sulla's Second Civil War. The battle pitted the Optimates under the command of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix against the Populares forces commanded by Gaius Marius the Younger. The battle resulted in a decisive Optimate victory.

Context 

After signing the peace treaty at Dardanos, Sulla returned to Italy at the head of his battle-hardened army with the intention of confronting his political opponents, the Populares. They were led by Gaius Marius the Younger and by Gnaeus Papirius Carbo. Sulla therefore invaded Italia in 83 BC, routing various Populares armies. Encamping for the winter, both sides made preparations to continue the fighting with the start of the Spring war season when the war became intensified and bloody.

The battle
According to historical accounts, one night in April, Sulla had a dream that Gaius Marius told his son, Gaius Marius the Younger, that he should not give battle to Sulla's forces the following day. Encouraged by this premonition, Sulla decided to immediately give combat and called on Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella, who was encamped nearby. Dolabella's army was exhausted from marching in an intense rainstorm and the military tribunes had ordered that the army make camp rather than give battle. Emboldened by the enemy's lack of offensive action, Gaius Marius decided to attack thinking he would be able to surprise the Optimates and win the day. Sulla's veterans simply stuck their pila into the ground to create a makeshift barricade, drew their swords, formed battle lines and counter-attacked. The Sullans' counter-attack put the Marians on the defensive, eventually, their left began to waver and either slowly or speedily (the accounts differ) they were driven back. In the end five cohorts of foot and two of horse deserted to Sulla causing a general collapse and Marius' army scattered in rout. Marius lost 28,000 men (killed, captured, turned coat or fled) while Sulla claimed to have only lost 23 men.

Consequences 
The surviving Populares forces, including Marius, took refuge at Preneste to escape the pursuing Sullan forces. Sulla arrived shortly thereafter and besieged the city. The city fell on 4 November, holding out surprisingly until all of Italy was under Sulla's direct control.

It was affiliated with the Leonese People's Union as its youth wing until April 2010, when they were replaced by the Leonesist Youth.

Conceyu Xoven claimed to have had more than 1,500 members and to have been the most important organization in the Leonese Country, having won the University of León elections for students. The organization defended the self-government of the Spanish provinces of León, Zamora, Salamanca and a so-called ""reunification"" referendum in territories from other provinces, autonomous communities and countries, as the ""Carrión Strip"" (Palencia), the Valderaduey valley (Valladolid), El Barco de Ávila-Piedrahita area (Ávila), Valdeorras & Viana (Galicia) and the Portuguese Bragança District. From the beginning until the end of the organization's activity the General Secretary of Conceyu Xoven was Abel Pardo Fernández.

Participation in elections

Members of the organization participated in several municipal elections in the Spanish provinces of León and Zamora within regionalist UPL, and its General Secretary became the councillor for Education, New Technologies and Leonese Culture in León. Some members of the organization also participated in the lists of the Salamancan People's Union in the province of Salamanca, where they got two town councillors elected.

Flag

The flag of the organization was a red field with a thin golden circle and a golden sun symbol within. The colors were those of the Leonese flag and the sun symbol represented the South Astur people, origin of Leonese region, according to Conceyu Xoven.

Language

Conceyu Xoven used to make use of Leonese language as the official language of the organization, and developed some initiatives for its recognition, like a campaign for the officiality of Leonese language in the reform of the Castile and León Autonomy Statute.

659,8909530,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokolg%C3%A9p,Pokolgép,"Pokolgép is a Hungarian heavy metal band formed in the early 1980s (around 1982). They were among the first heavy metal bands in Hungary along with Moby Dick. The name ""Pokolgép"" literally means Infernal Machine, but is the Hungarian word for a home-made bomb.

History

The early years
The founding members of Pokolgép were Gábor Kukovecz, Endre Paksi and Tibor Varga in the late 1970s. Kukovecz took guitar lessons from Prognózis guitarist/singer István Vörös who suggested that the name of the metal band be ""Kommandó"", which sounded less offensive. They used this name for some months before changing it back to Pokolgép. At the beginning of their music career, they were going through a rough patch because of their poverty and the government's negative attitude towards the band. They had been playing semi-illegal concerts on the outskirts of Budapest and as a result, they found unexpected success. They had had several drummers and guitarists until they found László Nagyfi for playing the second guitar and András Gyenizse for drums. In 1985, Paksi left the band due to personal conflicts (he couldn't agree with Kukovecz on the leading of the band) and went on to form Ossian. He was replaced by György Pazdera on the bass guitar. Some months later, Gyenizse emigrated to the US, so Pazdera invited his old friend László Tarcza to join them.
In 1983 the band was the runner-up in Ki mit tud? (a state-organised talent-searching festival), so they were allowed to record a song (""Kegyetlen asszony"") which was released on a split 7"" single. They also recorded two songs in the Hungarian Radio in 1984 (""Cirkusz és rács"" and ""A bűn""). In 1985 they recorded and released their first single with two songs (""A Sátán"" and ""A maszk"").

A very special thing happened in 1986: the government allowed Hungaroton to release the first heavy metal album in Hungary. This was the debut album of Pokolgép, titled Totális Metal. This was the time heavy metal bands started to come to the Eastern bloc (e.g. Iron Maiden and Queen), mainly to Poland and Hungary. Pokolgép played before Metallica and Motörhead in the late 1980s. In 1987 Pokolgép released their second album, Pokoli színjáték. Pokoli színjáték was first played in concert, and released days after.
In 1988-89, Pokolgép went on a European tour, playing in the two German states, the Netherlands and Belgium, and released their third album in 1989 (title: Éjszakai bevetés). They recorded a concert at the end of 1989 in Petőfi Hall, and then released as the fifth album in 1990 with the title ""Koncertlemez"". Before releasing the concert audio footage, they made their fourth album, ""Metál az ész"". This album was made in a rather bad atmosphere, as guitarist Nagyfi and vocalist Kalapács were about to quit the band.

Lineup changes
Nagyfi said in an interview that Kukovecz and he could not agree on the style of music to be played. Nagyfi preferred raw, more impulsive and speedy songs, while Kukovecz liked solos and melodies. This led to Nagyfi and Kalapács leaving to form Omen. The remaining three Pokolgép members, Tarcza, Pazdera and Kukovecz started to look for a new singer and second guitarist. Péter Kun briefly joined as guitarist before leaving to join Edda művek. The vocalist became József Rudán from Coda, a Led Zeppelin tribute band.

Controversy
On 27 December 1987 a fifteen-year-old man Lajos ""Szőrme"" Varga suffered a severe accident during the Metál Karácsony festival held in the Petőfi Csarnok event hall.  A pyrotechnic device exploded and pieces of it hit Szőrme's head causing a traumatic injury.  Szőrme's head almost collapsed into two pieces, as his corpus callosum was cut by the pyrotechnic device.  He was in a coma for three months and nearly died several times but doctors were able to save his life. Pokolgép still deny their responsibility for this accident.  Szőrme is not able to work or establish proper social contacts, but his mental capacity is still above average.

660,61574506,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herlinde%20Koelbl,Herlinde Koelbl,"Herlinde Koelbl (born 31 October 1939) is a German photographic artist, author and documentary filmer.

Her comprehensive work is characterized above all by long-term photographic projects, often complemented by in-depth interviews. She is particularly interested in creating portraits of milieus and people. Herlinde Koelbl has received a number of awards for her photographic work, for example the Dr Erich Salomon Prize in 2001. Since 2009, she has regularly worked as an author and photographer for ZEIT magazine, in the column “What saved me”.

Biography 
Herlinde Koelbl was born in Lindau on Lake Constance, Germany, 1939, and grew up there. She studied fashion design in Munich and worked in the field, while becoming a mother of four. In 1975, she discovered her love for photography and taught herself all the necessary techniques.

She taught and gave lectures at the Parsons School in New York, the University of Shanghai, China, the College of the Arts, Sydney, the Art School for Photography, Vienna, and Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie, Arles.

Her works are in several private and permanent collections, such as  the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, huis Marseille, stichting voor fotografie, Amsterdam, and Jewish Museum, Frankfurt a.M.

Koelbl lives in Munich and Berlin. She is an honorary member of the DGPh, BFF hall of fame.

Career 
In 1976 she started working as a freelance photographer, for newspapers like The New York Times, Stern, Die Zeit and others. Already 1980 she published her first photobook The German Living Room. She created her typical working approach by photographing methodically a whole series of pictures, displaying a broad spectre of society. Her first internationally noticed success was the photographic book Jewish Portraits in 1989. She photographed and talked to 80 German-speaking Jews, who survived the Shoa. With this book she established her personal style, which she kept in most of the books that followed. She not only took portraits, but also interviewed the portrayed and added large interviews in the book. Traces of Power may be her best-known work so far. She photographed, filmed and interviewed 15 personalities from politics and business from 1991 to 1998, among them Chancellor Angela Merkel, ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and ex-Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. The project was published in 1999, the documentary film with the same title was awarded the Deutscher Kritikerpreis and was nominated for the Grimme Preis. The exhibition was shown at numerous museums, among them the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin, the Haus der Kunst in Munich and the Haus der Geschichte in Bonn, as well as at Art Frankfurt 2002. Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the opening speech at the premiere of the show at the Haus der Kunst in Munich.

Herlinde Koelbl has published more than 20 books and several documentary films. She has been awarded numerous prizes. 2009 her first large retrospective was shown at the Martin Gropius Bau in Berlin.

661,2161800,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash%20Harry%20%28St%20Trinian%27s%29,Flash Harry (St Trinian's),"Henry Cuthbert Edwards aka Flash Harry is a fictional character from the St. Trinian's series of films who first appears in the 1954 The Belles of St Trinian's and who may also be a spiv. The term refers to ""an ostentatious, loudly-dressed, and usually ill-mannered man"". The best-known portrayer is George Cole in the 1950s–1960s films.

In the St Trinian's films, Harry is a long-term associate of the girl pupils, a Cockney involved in all sorts of shady dealings. His father sold racecards and, when he was 12, Harry himself was employed as a boot polisher by Miss Fritton, headmistress of St Trinian's, and may be an antithesis of Harry Flashman (the bully) of the 1857 book Tom Brown's School Days.  As an adult, Harry is one of the few whom the pupils trust: he helps to bottle and sell their gin, distilled in the school chemistry lab, and places bets on race horses for them. Harry also runs the St Trinian's Matrimonial Agency for the teenage Sixth Form girls, setting them up with wealthy men. He even runs a betting scam of his own.

By the time Amber Spottiswood (Dora Bryan) becomes headmistress, Harry's official connection to the school is as ""chairman of the board of governors"" and he earns money as a costermonger while the school is closed. He sets up a betting shop on the school grounds under the name Harry Hackett Ltd and takes bets from locals and pupils.

Harry appears to be quite well known in the criminal community, another crook (Lionel Jeffries) referring to him as ""riff-raff"".

Portrayers
""Flash Harry"" was played by George Cole in the first four St Trinian's movies:
The Belles of St Trinian's, 1954
Blue Murder at St Trinian's, 1957
The Pure Hell of St Trinian's, 1960
The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery, 1966. Here he is referred to as ""Harry Hackett"", but this may be a pseudonym.

Joe Melia played the part in The Wildcats of St Trinian's in 1980.

Russell Brand was ""Flash Harry"" in the 2007 film, St. Trinian's but did not return for St. Trinian's II: The Legend of Fritton's Gold in 2009.

The main plot of The Belles of St. Trinian's centred on the kidnapping of a race horse and featured Sid James of Carry On fame as a shady bookmaker. Two years later, James starred in the comedy Dry Rot which followed a similar plot. James's character was also called Flash Harry and was in some ways similar to the Flash Harry of St. Trinian's.

665,7440698,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shankaracharya%20Temple,Shankaracharya Temple,"Shankaracharya Temple or Jyeshteshwara Temple is a Hindu temple situated on top of the Shankaracharya Hill on the Zabarwan Range in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is at a height of  above the valley floor and overlooks the city of Srinagar.

On festivals such as Herath, as Maha Shivratri is known as in the region, the temple is visited by Kashmiri Hindus. The temple is also considered as a Buddhist icon, and with the hill which has had multiple names over the centuries, is connected to the Persian and Muslim faith as well.

The temple and adjacent land is a monument of national importance, centrally protected under the Archaeological Survey of India. Dharmarth Trust has managed the temple since the 19th century, along with others in the region. Karan Singh is the sole chairperson trustee.

History 

The structure is considered as the oldest temple in Kashmir, historically and traditionally. It is situated on a hill that is a well preserved Panjal trap formed by Permian era volcanic activity. There is no consensus with regard to an exact date of construction. 

The earliest historical reference to the hill comes from Kalhana. He called the mountain 'Gopadri' or 'Gopa Hill'. Kalhana says that King Gopaditya granted the land at the foot of the hill to the Brahmins that had come from the ""Aryadesa"". The land grant, an agraharam, was called 'Gopa Agraharas'. This area at the base is now called Gupkar. Kalhana mentions another village in the vicinity of the hill where King Gopaditya housed some of the Brahmins to a village next door in present day Galgate. Kalhana also mentions that King Gopaditya built the temple on the top of the hill as a shrine to Jyesthesvara (Shiva Jyestharuda) around 371 BC.

While the associated history dates to 371 BC, K. Warikoo, a professor at a centre of JNU's School of International Studies, places the present re-constructed structure of temple to the 6th century AD. In 1899 James Fergusson placed the temple construction to the 17th to 18th century. Fergusson disputes claims that structures on the basis of which he makes this claim are from repairs. Aurel Stein while agreeing that the superstructures are from a more recent date, places the base and the stairs as much older. Historical figures associated with the monument include Jaloka, one of the sons of Ashoka (Gonandiya), according to the Rajatarangini.

Kashmiri Hindus strongly believe the temple was visited by Adi Shankara (8th century CE) and has ever since been associated with him; this is how the temple and hill got the name Shankaracharya. It is here that the literary work Soundarya Lahari was composed. It was composed by Adi Shankara after accepting the major faith in the region at the time, that of Shakti, and that the union of Shiva and Shakti, as in Shaktism, transpired into the symbolism of the Sri Yantra.

Names associated with the hill include Sandhimana-parvata, Koh-e-Suleman, Takht-i-Sulaiman or simply Takht Hill, Gopadri or Gopa Hill. The Dogra King Gulab Singh (1792-1857 AD) constructed the steps to the hill from Durga Naag temple side. Steps existed before as well, leading further, to the Jhelum. Nur Jahan used the stones of the steps in the construction of Pathar Mosque.

The Maharaja of Mysore came to Kashmir in 1925 and made the electrical search light installations at the temple, five around it and one on the top. The Maharaja left an endowment to fund the cost of electricity. In 1961 Shankaracharaya of Dwarkapeetham put the statue of Adi Shankaracharaya in the temple. Sri Aurobindo visited the temple area in 1903. Vinoba Bhave visited it in August 1959. 

A  road to the temple was constructed by Border Roads Organisation in 1969. While this was road construction was primarily to aid the setting up of a communications tower, and part of the road would be closed to the public, the road would also be used for those going to the temple. There are around 240 steps to reach the presiding deity. The Dharmarth Trust has built two small shelters here for sadhus. The hill has a large range of flora. There is very limited human activity on the hill other than religious tourism. From the top of the hill, Justine Hardy, a British writer, counted over 1350 boats on the Dal Lake. Jhelum is visible. The wide panorama covers major landmarks such as Dal Lake, Jhelum, and Hari Parbat.

Architecture and design 

The temple rests on a solid rock. A  tall octagonal base supports a square building on top. Each side of the octagon is  feet. The front, back and flanks are plain while the other four sides have minimal design but noticeable angles. The center is made up of a circle  in diameter with an entrance  wide. The walls are .

The terrace around the square temple is reached by a stone staircase enclosed between two walls. A doorway on the opposite side of the staircase leads to the interior, which is a small and dark chamber, circular in plan. The ceiling is supported by four octagonal columns, which surround a Basin containing a Lingam encircled by a snake.

Current status 

The temple is used for regular worship and pilgrims visit the temple during the Amarnath Yatra. During the yatra, on the lunar phase of the new moon, the associated tradition of bringing Shiva's holy mace to the temple is carried out. The temple is part of the governments' tourist circuits. On occasions such as Maha Shivaratri, Herath, the temple is lit up. To ensure adequate preparations during festivals, as is the procedure with other religious and cultural centers in the city such as Hazratbal Shrine, the district administration reviews arrangements. The temple was one of hundred Archaeological Survey of India monuments lit up in 2021 to mark the administration of one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses in India.

In popular culture 

In 1948 Sheikh Abdullah wrote a letter to the Madras weekly Swatantra. Abdullah directed his message to south India at a time when India had sent someone from the south to defend its case in the United Nations, He wrote that Shankaracharya, someone from the south, came to Kashmir where his dialogue with a Kashmiri Hindu lady, in which he was outwitted, led to the development of Shaivism.  Abdullah wrote that ""a memorial to the great Shankaracharya in Kashmir stands prominent on the top of the Shankaracharya Hill in Srinagar"" and that the temple contained an idol of Shiva.

The 2000 Bollywood films Mission Kashmir and Pukar feature the temple. The temple also briefly features in the 1974 the song Jai Jai Shiv Shankar.

Notes

In 2012, government figures placed 438 temples in the valley. According to the chairperson of Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, there are 1,842 sites associated with Hinduism in Kashmir including big and small temples, springs, caves and trees.

666,405847,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS%20primality%20test,AKS primality test,"The AKS primality test (also known as Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality test and cyclotomic AKS test) is a deterministic primality-proving algorithm created and published by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena, computer scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, on August 6, 2002, in an article titled ""PRIMES is in P"". The algorithm was the first that can provably determine whether any given number is prime or composite in polynomial time, without relying on mathematical conjectures such as the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The proof is also notable for not relying on the field of analysis. In 2006 the authors received both the Gödel Prize and Fulkerson Prize for their work.

Importance
AKS is the first primality-proving algorithm to be simultaneously general, polynomial-time, deterministic, and unconditionally correct. Previous algorithms had been developed for centuries and achieved three of these properties at most, but not all four. 
 The AKS algorithm can be used to verify the primality of any general number given. Many fast primality tests are known that work only for numbers with certain properties. For example, the Lucas–Lehmer test works only for Mersenne numbers, while Pépin's test can be applied to Fermat numbers only.
 The maximum running time of the algorithm can be bounded by a polynomial over the number of digits in the target number. ECPP and APR conclusively prove or disprove that a given number is prime, but are not known to have polynomial time bounds for all inputs.
 The algorithm is guaranteed to distinguish deterministically whether the target number is prime or composite. Randomized tests, such as Miller–Rabin and Baillie–PSW, can test any given number for primality in polynomial time, but are known to produce only a probabilistic result.
 The correctness of AKS is not conditional on any subsidiary unproven hypothesis. In contrast, Miller's version of the Miller–Rabin test is fully deterministic and runs in polynomial time over all inputs, but its correctness depends on the truth of the yet-unproven generalized Riemann hypothesis.

While the algorithm is of immense theoretical importance, it is not used in practice, rendering it a galactic algorithm.  For 64-bit inputs, the Baillie–PSW test is deterministic and runs many orders of magnitude faster.  For larger inputs, the performance of the (also unconditionally correct) ECPP and APR tests is far superior to AKS.  Additionally, ECPP can output a primality certificate that allows independent and rapid verification of the results, which is not possible with the AKS algorithm.

Concepts
The AKS primality test is based upon the following theorem: Given an integer  and integer  coprime to ,  is prime if and only if the polynomial congruence relation

holds within the polynomial ring . Note that  denotes the indeterminate which generates this polynomial ring.

This theorem is a generalization to polynomials of Fermat's little theorem.  In one direction it can easily be proven using the binomial theorem together with the following property of the binomial coefficient:
 for all  if  is prime.

While the relation () constitutes a primality test in itself, verifying it takes exponential time: the brute force approach would require the expansion of the  polynomial and a reduction  of the resulting  coefficients.

The congruence is an equality in the polynomial ring . Evaluating in a quotient ring of  creates an upper bound for the degree of the polynomials involved. The AKS evaluates the equality in , making the computational complexity dependent on the size of . For clarity, this is expressed as the congruence

which is the same as:

for some polynomials  and .

Note that all primes satisfy this relation (choosing  in () gives (), which holds for  prime). This congruence can be checked in polynomial time when  is polynomial to the digits of . The AKS algorithm evaluates this congruence for a large set of  values, whose size is polynomial to the digits of . The proof of validity of the AKS algorithm shows that one can find an  and a set of  values with the above properties such that if the congruences hold then  is a power of a prime.

History and running time
In the first version of the above-cited paper, the authors proved the asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm to be  (using Õ from big O notation)—the twelfth power of the number of digits in n times a factor that is polylogarithmic in the number of digits. However, this upper bound was rather loose; a widely-held conjecture about the distribution of the Sophie Germain primes would, if true, immediately cut the worst case down to .

In the months following the discovery, new variants appeared (Lenstra 2002, Pomerance 2002, Berrizbeitia 2002, Cheng 2003, Bernstein 2003a/b, Lenstra and Pomerance 2003), which improved the speed of computation greatly. Owing to the existence of the many variants, Crandall and Papadopoulos refer to the ""AKS-class"" of algorithms in their scientific paper ""On the implementation of AKS-class primality tests"", published in March 2003.

In response to some of these variants, and to other feedback, the paper ""PRIMES is in P"" was updated with a new formulation of the AKS algorithm and of its proof of correctness. (This version was eventually published in Annals of Mathematics.) While the basic idea remained the same, r was chosen in a new manner, and the proof of correctness was more coherently organized. The new proof relied almost exclusively on the behavior of cyclotomic polynomials over finite fields. The new upper bound on time complexity was , later reduced using additional results from sieve theory to .

In 2005, Pomerance and Lenstra demonstrated a variant of AKS that runs in operations, leading to another updated version of the paper. Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena proposed a variant which would run in  if Agrawal's conjecture were true; however, a heuristic argument by Pomerance and Lenstra suggested that it is probably false.

The algorithm
The algorithm is as follows:

 Input: integer .
 Check if n is a perfect power: if  for integers  and , output composite.
 Find the smallest r such that . (if r and n are not coprime, then skip this r)
 For all 2 ≤ a ≤ min (r, n−1), check that a does not divide n: If a|n for some 2 ≤ a ≤ min (r, n−1), output composite.
 If n ≤ r, output prime.
 For  to  do
 if (X+a)n≠ Xn+a (mod Xr − 1,n), output composite;
 Output prime.

Here ordr(n) is the multiplicative order of n modulo r, log2 is the binary logarithm, and  is Euler's totient function of r.

Step 3 is shown in the paper as checking 1 < (a,n) < n for all a ≤ r.  It can be seen this is equivalent to trial division up to r, which can be done very efficiently without using gcd.  Similarly the comparison in step 4 can be replaced by having the trial division return prime once it has checked all values up to and including 

Once beyond very small inputs, step 5 dominates the time taken.  The essential reduction in complexity (from exponential to polynomial) is achieved by performing all calculations in the finite ring
 
consisting of  elements. This ring contains only the  monomials , and the coefficients are in  which has  elements all of them codable within  bits.

Most later improvements made to the algorithm have concentrated on reducing the size of r which makes the core operation in step 5 faster, and in reducing the size of s, the number of loops performed in step 5.  Typically these changes do not change the computational complexity, but can lead to many orders of magnitude less time taken, e.g. Bernstein's final version has a theoretical speedup by a factor of over 2 million.

Proof of validity outline
For the algorithm to be correct, all steps that identify n must be correct. Steps 1, 3 and 4 are trivially correct, since they are based on direct tests of the divisibility of n. Step 5 is also correct: since (2) is true for any choice of a coprime to n and r if n is prime, an inequality means that n must be composite.

The difficult part of the proof is showing that step 6 is true. Its proof of correctness is based on the upper and lower bounds of a multiplicative group in ℤn[x] constructed from the (X + a) binomials that are tested in step 5. Step 4 guarantees that these binomials are  distinct elements of ℤn[x]. For the particular choice of r, the bounds produce a contradiction unless n is prime or a power of a prime. Together with the test of step 1, this implies that n is always prime at step 6.

Example 1: n = 31 is prime
Input: integer n = 31 > 1.

Where PolynomialMod is a term-wise modulo reduction of the polynomial. e.g. PolynomialMod[x+2x2+3x3, 3] = x+2x2+0x3

It was initially dominated by riders from New Zealand such as Barry Briggs and Ivan Mauger because of the British Final forming part of the World Speedway championship qualifying rounds. Briggs and Mauger were multiple world champions. It was not until 1975 that the final was restricted to British riders. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand then held their own World Individual Speedway championship qualifying rounds. In the first dozen finals, it was only won twice by a British born rider, both times by Peter Craven.

673,14663145,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document%20clustering,Document clustering,"Document clustering (or text clustering) is the application of cluster analysis to textual documents. It has applications in automatic document organization, topic extraction and fast information retrieval or filtering.

Overview
Document clustering involves the use of descriptors and descriptor extraction. Descriptors are sets of words that describe the contents within the cluster. Document clustering is generally considered to be a centralized process. Examples of document clustering include web document clustering for search users.

The application of document clustering can be categorized to two types, online and offline. Online applications are usually constrained by efficiency problems when compared to offline applications. Text clustering may be used for different tasks, such as grouping similar documents (news, tweets, etc.) and the analysis of customer/employee feedback, discovering meaningful implicit subjects across all documents.

In general, there are two common algorithms. The first one is the hierarchical based algorithm, which includes single link, complete linkage, group average and Ward's method.  By aggregating or dividing, documents can be clustered into hierarchical structure, which is suitable for browsing. However, such an algorithm usually suffers from efficiency problems. The other algorithm is developed using the K-means algorithm and its variants. Generally hierarchical algorithms produce more in-depth information for detailed analyses, while algorithms based around variants of the K-means algorithm are more efficient and provide sufficient information for most purposes.

These algorithms can further be classified as hard or soft clustering algorithms. Hard clustering computes a hard assignment – each document is a member of exactly one cluster. The assignment of soft clustering algorithms is soft – a document’s assignment is a distribution over all clusters. In a soft assignment, a document has fractional membership in several clusters. Dimensionality reduction methods can be considered a subtype of soft clustering; for documents, these include latent semantic indexing (truncated singular value decomposition on term histograms) and topic models.

Other algorithms involve graph based clustering, ontology supported clustering and order sensitive clustering.

Given a clustering, it can be beneficial to automatically derive human-readable labels for the clusters. Various methods exist for this purpose.

Clustering in search engines
A web search engine often  returns thousands of pages in response to a broad query, making it difficult for users to browse or to identify relevant information.  Clustering methods can be used to automatically group the retrieved documents into a list of meaningful categories.

Procedures
In practice, document clustering often takes the following steps:
 
1. Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of parsing text data into smaller units (tokens) such as words and phrases. Commonly used tokenization methods include Bag-of-words model and N-gram model.

2. Stemming and lemmatization

Different tokens might carry out similar information (e.g. tokenization and tokenizing). And we can avoid calculating similar information repeatedly by reducing all tokens to its base form using various stemming and lemmatization dictionaries.

3. Removing stop words and punctuation

Some tokens are less important than others. For instance, common words such as ""the"" might not be very helpful for revealing the essential characteristics of a text. So usually it is a good idea to eliminate stop words and punctuation marks before doing further analysis.

4. Computing term frequencies or tf-idf

After pre-processing the text data, we can then proceed to generate features. For document clustering, one of the most common ways to generate features for a document is to calculate the term frequencies of all its tokens. Although not perfect, these frequencies can usually provide some clues about the topic of the document. And sometimes it is also useful to weight the term frequencies by the inverse document frequencies. See tf-idf for detailed discussions.

5. Clustering

We can then cluster different documents based on the features we have generated. See the algorithm section in cluster analysis for different types of clustering methods.

6. Evaluation and visualization

Finally, the clustering models can be assessed by various metrics. And it is sometimes helpful to visualize the results by plotting the clusters into low (two) dimensional space. See multidimensional scaling as a possible approach.

Clustering v. Classifying 
Clustering algorithms in computational text analysis groups documents into grouping a set of text what are called subsets or clusters where the algorithm's goal is to create internally coherent clusters that are distinct from one another. Classification on the other hand, is a form of supervised learning where the features of the documents are used to predict the ""type"" of documents.

677,51659092,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiperspectivity,Multiperspectivity,"Multiperspectivity (sometimes polyperspectivity) is a characteristic of narration or representation, where more than one perspective is represented to the audience. 

Most frequently the term is applied to fiction which employs multiple narrators, often in opposition to each-other or to illuminate different elements of a plot, creating what is sometimes called a multiple narrative, or multi-narrative. 

However, a similar concept is applied to historical process, in which multiple different perspectives are used to evaluate events. Educators have extended the concept and term to apply to techniques used to teach multiple disciplines, including social sciences, like economics and civics, and physical education.

Use in history 

The use of multiple perspectives arose because educators and scholars from the recent decades questioned the validity of one-sided historical narratives. Instead of focusing on a dominant group's point of view, they suggested to employ multiperspectivity. This is because of the diversity and cultural pluralism, since many groups – women, the poor, ethnic minorities, etc. – have been ignored in traditional historical narratives. 

Good historians must not just focus on one side of the story, instead they must look into different sources to know if the facts corroborate with each other and to produce more accurate interpretations. ""In history, multiple perspectives are usual and have to be tested against evidence, and accounted for in judgments and conclusions."" Ann Low-Beer explains.

 Multiple historical narratives provide space to inquire and investigate.
 Different sources offer different historical truths.
 It brings a more complex, complete and richer understanding of the past. 
 It can be used to show corroboration of acts, to show diverse perspectives of a single event, and to showcase the human condition in compelling ways.
 Multiperspectivity is a significant tool for stimulating historical understanding and thinking and a necessary precondition for all citizens that live in a multicultural society.

678,723595,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York%20Steak%20House,York Steak House,"York Steak House was a national chain of steakhouse restaurants in the United States. It was among several chains owned at the time by cereal manufacturer General Mills. By 1982, there were nearly 200 restaurants in 27 states from Texas to Maine. Though popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the majority of its locations shut down in 1989.

The fate of the rest of the chain after 1989 still remains unclear. One source reported that the remaining York Steak House chain was eventually purchased by Uno Restaurant Holdings Corporation while other sources reported that the remaining York Steak House chain was sold in 1989 to U.S.A. Cafes Inc., a major franchisee of Bonanza Steakhouses, for conversion to the Bonanza brand.

The restaurants, located primarily in shopping malls, generally had a floorplan of a cafeteria: cold items on one side, hot items on the other, with the cashier at the end. The decor was composed of subdued lighting, heavy wooden furniture, and iron chandeliers.

The restaurants were run cafeteria style, with a-la-carte pricing of items. Tipping was not allowed at any of its restaurants. There was an extra charge for pats of butter and sour cream.

History
The first York Steak House was opened in 1966 by Eddie Grayson and Bernie Gros in Columbus, Ohio. The second unit of the chain was built and operated by Grayson's brother Howard inside the Maine Mall in South Portland, Maine, when the mall first opened in 1971.

In April 1977, York Steak House was purchased by General Mills. At the time of the acquisition, York had 47 units. Another source claimed that York had 150 at the time of its sale to General Mills.

In the early 1980s, many of the York Steak House locations were converted into a new concept called York's Choices, which featured a round bakery case/kiosk that sold its signature cakes and pies at the front of the store.

Although it is not very clear when General Mills disposed of the York Steak House chain, it is known that York Steak House was not part of General Mills' portfolio of restaurant chains when Darden Restaurants was spun off in 1995.

After General Mills sold the chain, a limited number of York Steak Houses continued to operate for several years as independent restaurants.  As of 2017, only one restaurant is known to remain in operation using the York name, in Columbus, Ohio, near the now-defunct Westland Mall. This location became an independently-owned franchised operation in 1989.  It largely retains the signature look and cafeteria-style format of the former chain.

683,18897198,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshima%20clan,Toshima clan,"The  was a Japanese samurai clan prominent in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods of Japanese history in the northwest of what is today Tokyo. The clan was based primarily in Shakujii castle, in what is today Shakujii Park in the town of Shakujii, in Nerima-ku, until the fall of the castle in the late 1470s to Ogigayatsu Uesugi clan vassal Ōta Dōkan.

History
The clan made its chief seat of governance in the area around the Hiratsuka Shrine in what is today the Nakazato area of Tokyo's North Ward (Kita-ku), and expanded their influence over the years to cover a much wider area, delegating much of it to branch families such as the Miyagi, Takinogawa, Shimura, and Itabashi clans. The Toshima obtained and moved into Shakujii towards the end of the Kamakura period (1185-1333).

The clan's power and lineage solidified over the 13th-14th centuries. Though a number of clan heads had no direct male heir, for roughly one century from 1282 to 1395 the clan was supported by the Miyagi clan, with whom the Toshima shared territory and intermarried. Miyagi Tamenori was the son of Miyagi Masanori and a daughter of Toshima Shigehiro; Tamenori would in turn father 11th clan head Toshima Munetomo.

Following the death of ninth clan head Toshima Yasukage, on account of the minority of his son Toshima Tomoyasu, Yasukage's brother Toshima Kagemura took over as clan head. He expanded and solidified the clan's control over the districts of Toshima, Adachi, Tama, Niiza and Kodama. Toshima-san Dōjō-ji, which would later become the chief clan temple of the Toshima, was established in 1372 in a location adjacent to Shakujii castle by Kagemura's adopted son, Toshima Terutoki. Terutoki's birth father, Hōjō Tokiyuki, was hidden and protected at Shakujii during the Nakasendai Rebellion (1335) by Toshima Kagemura; since Kagemura lacked a male heir, Terutoki was adopted to succeed him as clan head. He died in 1375, and when his son Toshima Kagenori died in turn, leaving no heir, the position of clan head passed to Toshima Munetomo; as described above, Munetomo was related to the Miyagi family, and was of a different branch of the Toshima clan from the previous clan heads.

Another temple strongly associated with the clan, Sanbō-ji, was established to the east of Shakujii castle in 1394. It is said to have been moved to its current location on the edge of Sanbō-ji Pond, one of two ponds which form the center of modern-day Shakujii Park, by Ōta Dōkan, following the destruction of the Toshima clan by his hand in the late 1470s.

Thirteenth clan head Toshima Noriyasu led the clan in siding with Uesugi Norimoto, general of Ashikaga Mochiuji's forces, during the 1417 rebellion of Uesugi Zenshū. In the political and military conflicts surrounding the Kyōtoku Incident (1454-1482), the Toshima clan at first supported Ashikaga Shigeuji, but later switched sides to support Uesugi Fusaaki and Uesugi Akisada of the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi clan. During this time, Uesugi vassal Nagao Kageharu rebelled against the Uesugi clan and, along with the Ashikaga, sought to take control of the Kantō region. Toshima clan heads Toshima Yasutsune, lord of Shakujii and Nerima castles, and his brother Toshima Yasuaki, lord of Hiratsuka castle, sided with Kageharu, and were ultimately defeated by Uesugi vassal Ōta Dōkan, marking the demise of the clan.

Formed in 2003 by the husband and wife team of Jace Lasek and Olga Goreas, the band also includes Kevin Laing (drums), Richard White (guitar), Sheenah Ko (keyboards) and Robbie MacArthur (guitar).

Two of the band's six albums have been nominated for the Polaris Music Prize.

History

Early career
The band are currently a six-piece centered around the atmospheric songs of Lasek and Goreas, whose expansive sound draws from numerous aspects of rock 'n' roll history. The band's name comes from Besnard Lake in North-Central Saskatchewan. The band's second album, The Besnard Lakes Are the Dark Horse was recorded at singer Lasek's own Breakglass Studios, with members of Stars, The Dears and Godspeed You! Black Emperor/Silver Mt. Zion making guest appearances. It was nominated for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Many songs on The Besnard Lakes Are the Dark Horse are prefaced by recordings from shortwave radio number stations as first made popular in recordings such as The Conet Project.

A third studio album, The Besnard Lakes Are the Roaring Night, was released on Jagjaguwar on March 9, 2010. A 12"" record featuring album track ""Albatross"" and ""Four Long Lines"" was released on February 9, 2010. This album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize.

The band wrote their first film score for the film Sympathy for Delicious, from actor/director Mark Ruffalo. They also wrote and performed the score for the National Film Board of Canada web documentary Welcome to Pine Point. The collaboration came about when Lasek was approached by the website's co-creator Mike Simons, an old friend from high school. The soundtrack includes their reworking of the Trooper single, ""We're Here for a Good Time (Not a Long Time)"". The group released their score for Welcome to Pine Point as a twelve-inch EP entitled You Lived in the City.

694,4960182,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C5%8Dhai,Rōhai,"Rōhai (鷺牌) meaning “image of a heron” or “sign of a heron” is a family of kata practiced in some styles of karate. The kata originated from the Tomari-te school of Okinawan martial arts. It was called Matsumora Rōhai, after Kosaku Matsumora, who was presumably its inventor (not to be confused with Sokon Matsumura). Ankō Itosu later took this kata and developed three kata from it: Rōhai shodan, Rōhai nidan, and Rōhai sandan. In Shorin-ryū and Matsubayashi-ryū this kata introduces Gedan Shotei Ate (Lower/Downward Palm Heel Smash) and Ippon Ashi Dachi. (One Leg Stance) It contains a sequence of Tomoe Zuki (Circular Punch) exactly the same as the one in Bassai, although the ending of the sequence chains into Hangetsu Geri/Uke (Half Moon Kick/Block).

Shito-ryu teaches all three of the Itosu Rohai kata as well as Matsumora Rohai. Some styles such as Wadō-ryū employ only one of Itosu’s kata (Rōhai shodan or just Rōhai). While other styles such as Genseiryū and Shindō_jinen-ryū only teach Matsumora Rohai.

The Shotokan version of Rōhai (renamed Meikyo (明鏡), literally ""bright mirror"" by Gichin Funakoshi) is very distinct from either the Matsumora or Itosu versions. It is believed that Funakoshi being a much older and earlier student of Itosu than Kenwa Mabuni may have been taught a different version of Rohai from Itosu known as Gusukuma Rohai. Sometime in the early 1990s Tetsuhiko Asai introduced two new kata of his own design: Meikyo nidan and Meikyo sandan.

In Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do unlike most of its forms which can be traced back to Shotokan, their version of Rohai was based on the Matsumora version. Over the years practitioners have made numerous changes to the form including the addition of a board (or brick) breaking element, which can be performed using either a downward punch or palm strike.

The Main Campus of MIIS is located in Loyola Heights, Quezon City, and the Upper School campus is located along Katipunan Avenue, Quezon City, Philippines.

History 
The Multiple Intelligence International School was first established as Child's Place Preschool in 1996, by Mary Joy Canon-Abaquin.

It is the first educational institution in the Philippines that has based its approach on the multiple intelligence framework of Harvard-based cognitive psychologist, Howard Gardner.

Child's Place is the preschool department of MIIS that caters to the Preschool Child from 2 to 5 years. The Multiple Intelligence International School (Grades 1-8) was founded to serve Lower and Middle School students. MIIS Upper School (Grades 9-12), was founded in 2007.

In 2012, music researcher Pamela Costes-Onishi conducted a study that evaluated MIIS' Music Education curriculum with that of the Department of Education and found that it had distinct differences in approach and pedagogy.

In 2016, MIIS celebrated their 20th founding anniversary.

Academics and Curriculum 
MIIS does not conform to traditional modes of Philippine education. Following Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences Theory, MIIS focuses on eight intelligences among their students.

The K-12 program covers 6 years of primary education, four years of Junior High School, and two years of Senior High School. MIIS is aligned with the Philippine Department of Education standards for the enhanced K-12 program.

The school has been acknowledged as a leader in youth entrepreneurship in the Philippines.

On September 23, 2019, MIIS partnered with Smart Communications to hold the Youth Innovation Challenge, at the Philippine International Convention Center.

Campuses 
MIIS is located in two campuses in Loyola Heights, Quezon City, near Ateneo de Manila University and the University of the Philippines Diliman. The Main Campus, located in Escaler Street, Loyola Heights, Quezon City, houses the Child's Place Preschool and Lower and Middle School. The Upper School is located at Elizabeth Hall, Katipunan Avenue, Quezon City.

Council of International Schools Accreditation 
In 2018, MIIS was given accreditation by the Council of International Schools. MIIS was the fourth international school in the Philippines to attain CIS accreditation at the time.

697,22191265,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masmiyya%20al-Kabira,Al-Masmiyya al-Kabira,"Al-Masmiyya al-Kabira () was a Palestinian village in the Gaza Subdistrict, located  northeast of Gaza. With a land area of 20,687 dunams, the village site (135 dunams) was situated on an elevation of  along the coastal plain. It was depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Before the war, it had a population of 2,520 in 1945.

History
Remains from the Roman and  Byzantine eras have been found here, including a coin  made under Emperor Mauritius Tiberius (596–597 CE).  Remains, including pottery and glass were  found  from the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, with local glass-industry operation here in the  Abbasid era. The settlemnt continued during Ayyubid  and Mamluk times, with the wealth of pottery and glass found here indicating a strong economy.  
An undated column-base, with a Nine men's morris pattern incised  has also been found here.

Ottoman era
Al-Masmiyya was mentioned by the Syrian Sufi teacher and traveller Mustafa al-Bakri al-Siddiqi (1688-1748/9) in the first half of the eighteenth century, and in the 1780s, the French traveller Volney noted that the village produced a great deal of spun-cotton.

In 1838, el-Mesmiyeh was noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.

In 1863, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he found to have seven hundred inhabitants. Around the well were stones, some large, and apparently  ancient.  The village was surrounded by  plantations of  tobacco,  watermelons and cucumbers.  An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that “El-Mesmije”  had 243 houses and a population of 656, though the population count included only men.

The adjectival al-Kabira (""major"") was later added to Masmiyya's name to distinguish it from the nearby al-Masmiyya al-Saghira, established in the mid-19th century. In the late 19th century, al-Masmiyya al-Kabira was laid out in a trapezoid-like pattern, with the long base of the trapezoid facing west. The village was surrounded by gardens and its houses were constructed of adobe bricks or concrete. The most recent expansion of it was westward and southwestward.

British Mandate era
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Mesmiyet Kabira had a population of 1390 Muslims, increasing in the  1931 census when Masmiya al Kabira had a population of 1756 Muslims and 4 Christians, in a total of 354 houses.

The village contained two mosques and  two schools. The boys' school was built in 1922 and had an enrollment of 307 students in 1947, while the girls' school was built in 1944 and had 39 students 1947. Al-Masmiyya al-Kabira was one of the few localities in the district to be governed by a village council. The town had a gas station and a clinic.

In the 1945 statistics, Al-Masmiyya al-Kabira had 2,520 inhabitants; 2,510 Muslims and 10 Christians,  with a total of  20,687  dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Agriculture was the main economic activity of the village and the dominant crops were citrus and grains; in 1945, a total of 1,005 dunams were devoted to citrus, while 18,092 were allotted to grains, while 135 dunams were built-up land. Beside crop cultivation, residents raised livestock and poultry. Some also worked in the nearby British Army camp. Al-Masmiyya al-Kabira had a weekly market on Thursdays that attracted residents from neighboring communities.

1948 War and aftermath

The village was fenced in by Hagana forces purportedly to protect the village against Deir Yassin like incidents. Al-Masmiyya al-Kabira was captured by the Israeli forces of the Givati Brigade during Operation An-Far. The New York Times reported that it had been occupied on 11 July, blocking an Egyptian attempt to break through to Latrun from the direction of al-Majdal. However, the Haganah claim it was captured during ""several clearing operations in the brigade's rear guard, to eliminate the threat and danger posed by the presence of Arab civilian concentrations to the rear of the front.""

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and Morris reports that by 27 May 1949, 21 of the approx 400 former Palestinian Arab villages had been repopulated by newly arrived ‘olim, Al-Masmiyya al-Kabira along with Aqir, Zarnuqa, Yibna, Ijzim, Ein Hawd, Tarshiha, Safsaf, Tarbikha, Dayr Tarif and that six more including Deir Yassin were slated for colonization. Two moshavim, Bnei Re'em and Hatzav, were established on al-Masmiyya al-Kabira's land in 1949, with Yinon also founded on the village's former land in 1952. In 1976, another new village, Ahva was established on the land. A Palestinian Arab family was able to remain in the area and was used as Shabbat goy by the community of Bnei Re'em.

According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, in reference to the remains of al-Masmiyya al-Kabira in 1992:

The two schools and several village houses are extant. The girls' school is deserted, while the boys' school has been converted into an Israeli army installation. Some of the houses are inhabited, but others have been turned into warehouses. One house serves as a shop where juice is sold. All are made of concrete with simple architectural features—flat roofs and rectangular doors and windows. A date palm tree grows in the yard of a house that belonged to a Palestinian named Tawfiq al-Rabi. An Israeli gas station is located on the same spot where the village's gas station (once the property of Hasan Abd al-Aziz and Nimr Muhanna) once stood. The lands in the vicinity are cultivated by Israeli farmers.

700,2727369,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace%20Cunard,Grace Cunard,"Grace Cunard (born Harriet Mildred Jeffries; April 8, 1893 – January 19, 1967) was an American actress, screenwriter and film director. During the silent era, she starred in over 100 films, wrote or co-wrote at least 44 of those productions, and directed no fewer than eight of them. In addition, she edited many of her films, including some of the shorts, serials, and features she developed in collaboration with Francis Ford. Her younger sister, Mina Cunard, was also a film actress.

Early life and stage work
Born in 1893, Harriet Jeffries was the elder of two daughters of Ohio natives Washington and Lola (née Longshore) Jeffries. The federal census of 1900 documents that seven-year-old Harriet, her younger sister Armina (Mina), and their parents were still residing that year in Columbus, where Washington supported the family by working as a grocery clerk. Harriet completed her formal education in Columbus, leaving school after the eighth grade, presumably to devote full time to an acting career. When and where she was introduced to performing in theatre remains uncertain; but by 1906, at the age of 13, the future film star was already acting in local stage productions such as Dora Thorne, East Lynne, and then in New York in Princess of Patches. Much later, in 1916, the circumstances of Grace Cunard's (Harriet Jeffries') entry into acting are briefly discussed in ""Before the Stars Shone"", an article in the New York-based trade monthly Picture Play Magazine. That article by staff writer Al Ray informs his readers, ""Grace Cunard...when very young, begged for a stage life until her mother took her to a manager who gave her the title part in 'Dora Thorne.'"" Her other early stage performances included traveling with stock companies to theatres in Cleveland and St. Louis and appearing in vaudeville in various cities.

Film career
It is likely that Harriet was already using her stage name Grace Cunard before she started acting in films in 1908. According to Cunard, after one of her ""stock engagements"" a friend one evening at dinner dared her to try acting in ""'canned drama'"", a slang term used in the theatre community to describe motion pictures. She accepted the dare and ""in the spirit of fun"" went to the Biograph Company on East 14th Street in Manhattan and ""worked for a day's pay to see what it was like."" She enjoyed the experience, so she pursued more film roles, which at first consisted of small uncredited parts. Over the next three years she was cast in better roles at Biograph and at other studios located in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Some of those other companies included Kalem Studios, Edison, the American subsidiary of Pathé, Republic, and Lubin.

Move to California, 1912
With her stage and screen experience working for Eastern companies, Cunard in 1912 moved to California to work in the rapidly expanding film industry there. She was initially hired by ""fledgling producer"" Thomas H. Ince at Bison Studio, where director and actor Francis Ford cast her as the wife of General George Armstrong Custer in the two-reel military drama Custer's Last Fight. After her high-profile role in that release, Ince fired her when she refused to leave Ford's company to work elsewhere at Bison. Ford, infuriated by her treatment, left Bison with his crew and players, including Cunard, to work for Universal Pictures.  At Universal she continued throughout 1913 to co-star and collaborate with Ford in other two-reel shorts like The Black Masks, From Dawn Till Dark, The White Vaquero, The Belle of Yorktown, From Rail Splitter to President, and others. Their close professional relationship, which had quickly evolved into a personal one as well, led many movie fans to assume the couple were married. The two were increasingly being referred to in trade publications and newspapers as the production team of ""Ford-Cunard"", with Francis being credited consistently for directing and both of them being praised as ""unusually promising screen artists"".

By 1914, Grace was being recognized too in the press for her writing, including references to her ""novels"" and many screenplays. The Ford-Cunard two-reeler The She Wolf, which was released by Bison Pictures late in 1913, was one in a series of films in that period that focused attention on Cunard's writing. Promoted as a ""photoplay"" about an evil woman, a ""wrecker of men's hearts and reputations"", She Wolf circulated throughout the country and by May 1914 finally reached Phoenix, Arizona. There the state's leading newspaper, The Arizona Republican, announced, ""One of the most interesting and thrilling moving pictures ever shown at the Regale theater, is that scheduled for today. Francis Ford has dramatized Grace Cunard's famous novel, 'She Wolf', and with Miss Cunard appears in the moving picture version of the story.""

Continuing collaboration with Ford, 1914-1917
Cunard and Ford continued their collaboration throughout 1914, releasing an array of two-reel historical dramas, Westerns, comedies, and mysteries. A few examples from that year are The Mad Hermit, The Fall of '64, Won in the First, The Mysterious Leopard Lady, and Washington at Valley Forge. Turning to a more ambitious project, they developed for Universal in 1914 and also co-starred in the 15-episode serial Lucille Love, Girl of Mystery. That production's enormous success is reflected in the box-office receipts it generated. Costing only $30,000 or $2,000 per episode to make, the Lucille Love series eventually grossed what was then a staggering return in ticket sales: $1,500,000 ($ today). The financial success of Lucille Love inspired the Ford-Cunard partnership to release between their ongoing shorts three more serials for Universal over the next two years: the 22-episode The Broken Coin (1915), the 15-episode The Adventures of Peg o' the Ring (1916), and the 16-episode The Purple Mask (1916-1917).

Cunard's collaboration with Ford continued into 1917, the same year she married for the second time, not to Ford but to the Irish-born actor Joe Moore. Although the media had referred to her as ""Miss"" since she began working with Ford in 1912, Cunard had married earlier that same year in New York before moving to California. That first marriage appears to have been short-lived and ended, if not legally, for all practical purposes by the time she arrived on the West Coast. Nevertheless, Cunard's collaboration with Ford finally ended after June 1917 with the release of In Treason's Grasp, a five-reeler he directed for Renowned Pictures and in which she co-starred with him.

Screenwriting, directing and editing
At the time Cunard started working in films, it was not uncommon for members on set and in post-production to assume a variety of additional duties beyond their primary assignments. Cunard was no exception. While it is now well documented that a significant number of the ""pioneers"" in early American filmmaking were women, it was still not common by the 1910s for a young actress with an eighth-grade education to write, perform in, direct, and edit films to the extent Cunard did, often doing all those duties on a single project. Totals vary in film references regarding the number of silent productions in which she worked. Her entry in the 2005 edition of The Encyclopedia of Early Cinema credits her with starring in over 100 silent films, writing screenplays or treatments for 44 of those releases, and directing at least eight of them on her own and more in concert with Ford. Some period newspapers and trade publications credit her with writing between 150 and 200 ""photoplays"", while one newspaper in 1915 reported that she had authored 400 scenarios, a highly implausible figure given the amount of time Cunard had worked in motion pictures by then. Whatever the true totals, news items and reviews of her completed films testify that her output was prodigious, especially between 1913 and 1918.

In 1915, Richard Willis interviewed Cunard for the July issue of Motion Picture Magazine and questioned the 22-year-old actress about the different tasks she had performed on film projects and which of those tasks she enjoyed most:
A year after the preceding interview with Cunard, the fan magazine Photoplay published a feature article written by William M. Henry about the ""king and queen of movie melodrama"". The article, titled ""Her Grace and Francis I"", includes interviews with both Ford and Cunard. ""Ford freely admits"", writes Henry, ""that Miss Cunard provides most of the ideas for the stories."" He then quotes Ford regarding his and Cunard's methodology for developing their films: ""'It takes us about two hours to make a two reel scenario, once we get an idea...If we both agree on the plan for the story, we make the scenario together; if we disagree, each writes a scenario and then we either take the best one or combine the two.'""

1918-1929

Cunard's work as an actor, writer, and director did not cease after her collaboration with Ford ended. She starred in Hell's Crater, an elaborate five-reel Western written and directed by W. B. Pearson and filmed on location in Death Valley National Park. Released by Universal in early 1918, Hell's Crater was heavily promoted in trade publications. The next year she returned to acting in a serial format, ""supporting"" Elmo Lincoln in 18 episodes of Elmo the Mighty During 1920 and 1921, she had opportunities working with Marion H. Kohn Productions of San Francisco to once again use the full range of her talents in a series of two-reel Westerns. She wrote, directed, and starred in The Man Hater (1920); directed and starred in Gasoline Buckaroo (1920) and A Daughter of The Law (1921); wrote and starred in The Gun Runners (1921);  and co-wrote, directed and co-starred with Cole Hebert in Her Western Adventure (1921). After she co-starred in The Last Man on Earth and The Elk's Tooth in 1924, she was cast in fewer and fewer primary roles and was relegated to playing secondary characters for the remainder of the decade.

1930s-1940s
Cunard throughout the 1930s continued to act but the complexity of her roles steadily declined until she performed predominantly in minor or uncredited bit parts. In the 1940s she still secured work at RKO, Republic, and in few productions at her old ""home studio"", Universal. One of her more visible roles among her final appearances in that period is in the 1942 serial Gang Busters. She only appears as a landlady in one of its 13 episodes, but her presence in that production was deemed important enough by Universal to include her name in a third-tier bold credit on the serial's theater posters. Her last screen appearance, one uncredited, is in the role of a woman with a baby in the 1946 drama Magnificent Doll. Shortly after the release of that film, Universal underwent a change in leadership and administrative restructuring, which resulted in the studio discontinuing its program of serials and low-budget features. Cunard was 53 years old by that time, so after working nearly four decades in motion pictures, she decided to retire permanently from the industry.

Personal life and death
Cunard was married three times. On April 30, 1912 in New York, at the age of 19, she married actor Harry Harvey, who was 20 years her senior.  That marriage ended before 1917, although the reasons for its ending are not clearly documented. Her next marriage was to Irish-born actor Joe Moore. They wed at Seal Beach, California, on January 17, 1917 but divorced eight years later. Then, on September 1, 1925, Cunard married Frederick Lorenzo Tyler, a film stuntman who professionally used the name Jack Tyler Shannon. They remained married for over 40 years, until her death from cancer in 1967. At the time of her death, she was residing at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. Her gravesite is also in Los Angeles, at Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in the neighborhood of Chatsworth.

Legacy and honors

The Ford-Cunard 1917 short Unmasked was selected in 2014 by the United States Film Preservation Board for inclusion in the National Film Registry. In 2018, in recognition of the many contributions made by women to the development of the motion-picture industry in the silent era, film library and distributor Kino Lorber, Inc., in cooperation with the Library of Congress, released a special six-disc box set titled Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers. Included in that set are copies of three episodes from Cunard's 1916-1917 serial The Purple Mask as well as a copy of the short The Daughter of 'The Law''', which she directed and starred in, in 1921.

706,47831337,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz%20Rauscher,Franz Rauscher,"Franz Rauscher, born in  Vienna, Austria, (30 July 1900 – 11 March 1988) was an Austrian Social Democrat politician.

Life

Provenance and early years 
Rauscher's father was a railway worker.  He himself embarked on an apprenticeship as a mechanic and found work in a munitions factory.   Despite his youth he was elected a trades union official.   He took part in the wave demonstrations and strikes that broke out in Vienna directly after the First World War.   Then, in 1919, he switched to the railways, now employed as an office worker at the Westbahnhof (main railway station).  He again became active as a trades unionist.   Workers' education would be a recurring theme in Rauscher's career, and at the Westbahnhof he set up the Railwaymen's Library.
In 1926 he teamed up with Rosa Jochmann to found the Workers' Academy (""Arbeiterhochschule"") in Vienna 19 (Döbling).   It is not clear when or whether the two of them actually married, but they now became life-partners.

Rauscher was involved in setting up the Vienna Party School, of which he was the principal between 1927 and his arrest in 1934.

Years of political polarisation 
In the late 1920s he was among the co-organizers, in Lower Austria, of the Republikanischer Schutzbund, an SDAPÖ paramilitary movement set up to counter the growth in political extremism that was spilling onto the streets.   The Self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament took place on 4 March 1933 and was interpreted by Chancellor Dollfuss as an unexpected but not unwelcome invitation to suspend parliamentary democracy.   Social Democratic members were escorted from the parliament in Vienna by the police.   Over the next few months the Social Democratic Party was progressively repressed and outlawed, formally on 12 February 1934.    Trades unions were also banned:  Franz Rauscher remained politically engaged and went ""underground"" (which involved living without being registered at the city hall).   Then, as part of the backwash from the brief but intense Austrian Civil War, Rauscher was arrested in October 1934.   He then appeared as one of 28 defendants in the so-called ""trial of the socialists"" (""Sozialistenprozess"") which opened at the Vienna district court on 16 March 1936.   One of his co-defendants was Bruno Kreisky who would go one to become, many years later, Austria's longest-serving federal chancellor since the creation of the republic in 1919.   The trial received widespread coverage in the foreign press.   In the context of Austrifascism the convictions were a foregone conclusion, but the sentences, handed down on 24 March 1936, were significantly milder than many had anticipated.   Franz Rauscher received a ten month jail sentence for ""sedition and high treason"" (""Aufruhr und Hochverrat"") which he served in the Anhaltelager Wöllersdorf (loosely, ""Wöllersdorf holding camp"").   He also lost his job with the railways.   It is not clear from sources whether Rauscher spent time in pre-trial detention between his arrest in October 1934 and the trial in March 1936.   Any time already served would normally have been off-set against the sentence he received at the trial.   In any event, those sentenced to jail terms at the ""trial of the socialists"" in March 1936 were the beneficiaries of the political prisoners' amnesty in July 1936, meaning that Rauscher was released in or before July 1936.

Anschluss years 
In March 1938 German troops entered Austria, which was followed by rapid integration, giving rise to a ""Greater Germany"" that incorporated the two hitherto separate states.   A few days after the armies arrived from the west Franz Rauscher was arrested by the Gestapo, but he was released a week later.   He found a job with the Schoeller-Bleckmann Stahlwerke (steel company).   In 1939 he was re-arrested by the Gestapo, however.   This time he was transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp: he was held in state detention for the next six years.   At some stage during the Second World War, which in this part of Europe lasted from 1939 till 1945, he was transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp in occupied Poland.  Shortly before the war ended he was either liberated by the Red army or else managed to escape from the concentration camp as the state infrastructure of Nazi Germany collapsed.   He made his way back to Austria, arriving at Salzburg on 14 April 1945.   The Soviet and western governments had already declared the 1938 combining of Germany with Austria null and void, and within two weeks of Rauscher's arrival at the border by Salzburg a hastily assembled Austrian provisional government in Vienna, under Chancellor Renner, had anticipated the requirements of the country's new masters with a Declaration of Austrian Independence signed by the leaders of the three main political parties (which included the Social Democrats) on 27 April 1945.

Postwar 
From 1945 Rauscher was involved in the re-establishment of the Social Democratic Party of Austria.   He also contributed at a national level to rebuilding the country.   On 26 September 1945 he accepted an appointment as Undersecretary of State for security, administration, planning and the application of state assets.   He resigned from this post after slightly less than three months, in connection with his election the previous month to the National Council (parliament), in which he sat as an SPÖ member till standing down in November 1949, ahead of the next general election.   Between March 1946 and January 1947 Rauscher served briefly as secretary of state at what would today be identified as the Ministry of Economics.

710,613638,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton%20Cheney,Sutton Cheney,"Sutton Cheney ( ) is a village and civil parish in the borough of Hinckley and Bosworth in the county of Leicestershire, England, near the county border with Warwickshire. In addition to the village of Sutton Cheney itself, the civil parish also contains the villages of Dadlington and Shenton, a number of farms, and the location of the Battle of Bosworth. Its closest large towns are Nuneaton and Hinckley. Its closest market town is Market Bosworth.

The village of Sutton Cheney is clustered around the intersection of four roads: Ambion Lane leading westwards to the village of Shenton; Bosworth Road leading northwest to the neighbouring town of Market Bosworth; Main Street leading northeast to the villages of Cadeby or Stapleton; and Wharf Lane leading southwest to Sutton Cheney Wharf on the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal. 

The civil parish of Sutton Cheney is bordered by the civil parishes of Market Bosworth to the north; Cadeby to the northeast; Peckleton to the east; Barwell, Stoke Golding, and Higham on the Hill to the south; and Sheepy to the west. Its population at the 2011 census was 538.

History 
The earliest written mention of the village of Sutton Cheney is in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was named Sutone. It was mostly owned by Crowland Abbey with a minor holding in the hands of Hugh de Grandmesnil, a companion of William the Conqueror. At that time it was recorded as having four households.

The manor took the name 'Sutton Chainell' during the thirteenth century on account of a rich farmer named Chainell who held the village as a tenant of Crowland Abbey but the name appears variously as Sutton, Sutton juxta Bosworth, Sutton Chenyie, and Sutton Cheynell in deeds and other official registers between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries.

The army of Richard III made camp in the village on 21 August 1485, the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field, and the battle itself took place within the civil parish, near to Dadlington. Richard died in the battle, which was the last battle of the Wars of the Roses. It ended the Middle Ages in England and ushered in the Tudor period.

In 1564 there were 25 families living in Sutton Cheynell and in 1630 the freeholders were Sir William Roberts, Richard May, William Drakeley and John Swinfen. Sir William Roberts endowed six Almshouses for the village in 1612 and his tomb is still extant in the village church, with the inscriptions: 'Sir William Roberts was son of Thomas Roberts and married to his first wife Katherine, daughter of Richard Elkington, and to his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of Valentine Hartopp; but by neither had issue. He lived 79 years and died Feb 24 1633' and 'Here lyeth interred the body of Sir William Roberts, who in his life-time, being devoted both to hospitality and charity, among other memorable works erected, out of a pious mind, a hospital for six poor men adjoining the churchyard and endowed it with 30 pounds worth of land yearly for their maintenance for ever.'

Between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries, the village of Sutton Cheney was an estate village, developed to suit the needs of a single farming family, with the Hall as their home. In addition to workers' cottages, a further range of buildings such as a blacksmith's, bakery, and post office provided the essentials of rural life, together with Almshouses for poor single men. These have now all been converted to dwellings but the village retains its traditional character and is designated as a conservation area. Today, the majority of the land and approximately half the dwellings are still in the ownership of the estate, with half the dwellings in private ownership.

Battlefield Heritage Centre 
Within the civil parish, on Ambion Hill, is the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and Country Park, maintained by Leicestershire County Council as a country park and learning centre to advance public knowledge about the Battle of Bosworth Field.

The centre also contains the Tithe Barn restaurant and cafe, based in a reconstructed fourteenth century oak timbered barn, donated by the Derbyshire County Council.

Other monuments within the centre include King Richard's Well, where Richard III is reputed to have drunk before the battle and a cairn now stands as his monument, and a memorial sundial.

Sutton Cheney Wharf is situated within the civil parish on the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal and maintained by the Canal & River Trust. It gives access through Ambion Wood to the Battlefield Centre and there is also a cafe called Sutton Wharf on the site.

A heritage steam railway, the Battlefield Line Railway, runs from Shenton station, within the civil parish, to Shackerstone. It is operated by the Shackerstone Railway Society. 

In the village of Shenton the old village hall is now an art gallery and cafe, the White Dove Gallery, and a group of restored and listed farm buildings now operate as Whitemoors Antique Centre and Tearooms.

The Leicestershire Round, a 200 mile walk around the county of Leicestershire runs through the civil parish and the village itself, linking it by footpath to the adjacent town and civil parish of Market Bosworth in a walk through farmland and Market Bosworth Country Park.

Notable buildings in the village 

The village of Sutton Cheney has two Georgian coaching inns. The Hercules Revived (formerly The Hercules Inn), is named after the prizewinning horse Hercules owned by the Dixie family of Market Bosworth in the eighteenth century. It was renovated and restored in 2012. The Royal Arms (formerly The Greyhound Inn) was re-opened in 2003 as a hotel, restaurant, and wedding venue.

St James' Church dates originally from the early 13th century with repairs and restorations in the centuries since, including the west tower built in brick in the nineteenth century. Richard III reputedly heard his last Mass in the church the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field. The church is consequently known as ""the Battlefield Church"" and contains a plaque in remembrance of him. Many of the kneelers in the church were embroidered by members of the Richard III Society and on 22 March 2015, the funeral cortège of the King paused in Sutton Cheney en route to his burial in Leicester Cathedral.

The six Almshouses founded by Sir William Roberts in 1612 and altered in 1811, as a plaque records, due to ""the liberality of Rosamund Kinnersley"" are now a private home, having been converted in the late twentieth century.

The Hall dates from 1601 with later additions and a Victorian wing.

Townshend Farmhouse dates from the early 19th century with an earlier core.

The village has been designated as a conservation area.

Notable residents and visitors 

As well as Richard III, the parish also contained the campsite of Henry VII, the victor of the Battle of Bosworth, who was crowned King of England in the adjacent civil parish of Stoke Golding.

The famous mathematician Thomas Simpson FRS (1710-1761) of Market Bosworth, Nuneaton, and Woolwich is buried in the graveyard of St James' Church. There is a Latin memorial plaque to him inside the Church to the left of the door.

The village's clergyman from 1960 to 1986, the Rev. E. R. Boston, was notable as a traction engine and light railway enthusiast and engineer who constructed the now-dismantled Cadeby Light Railway. He was immortalised in his friend Rev. Wilbert Awdry's The Railway Series books (more commonly known as the Thomas the Tank Engine books) as ""the Fat Clergyman"". There is a plaque to him in the chancel of St James' Church.

714,51603884,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doriath%20%28video%20game%29,Doriath (video game),"Doriath is a side-view action-adventure platform game released for the Commodore 64 in 1985.

Plot

The wizard Elidaan the Loremaster descends into the underground labyrinth of Doriath in search of the immortality-granting Coronet of Arien, which was crafted by the Lord of Time, Atelan, and thrown into the abyss after he was spurned by the object of his affection, Fianna.

Gameplay

Doriath is a side-view action-adventure platform game set in the vast underground maze of Doriath, which the player explores in non-linear fashion by controlling the player character, a wizard. Basic movement (running and jumping) is handled with the joystick. Spells are used by holding down on the joystick and pressing the fire button. The ultimate goal of the game is to retrieve the Coronet; in order to do so, the player must find the eight pieces of the Riddlescroll of Wurslea, which, when assembled, will show the Coronet's location. In addition, the player has a wisdom meter which they must increase to 100% by acquiring various useful items hidden throughout the caverns.  Many of these items will expand the player's abilities, particularly the amulets that teach the player spells. There are also dragons guarding some of the items that serve as rudimentary boss monsters and require specific spells to defeat. The player can also heal and protect themselves to various effect by drinking several types of potions (created from ingredients found in the labyrinth), as well as pick up various keys to get through different kinds of locked doors. The player selects items in their inventory with the F1 key, and uses  them by pressing F7.

Reception

Doriath received mostly positive reviews  at the time of its release. Commodore Horizons gave the game 5/8 for graphics, 5/8 for sonics, and 7/8 for gameplay, calling it an ""excellent little cheapie"", and comparing it to ""Sorcery, Staff of Karnath, and any number of similar arcade adventures."" It also praised the game for its ""true combination of arcade skills – avoiding guards and hazards – and adventure strategies and mapping."" However,  the magazine considered the game's graphics to be merely adequate, and, judging it among budget titles, felt it inferior overall to Blackwyche. Laurie Sampson of Commodore User gave it 3/6 for graphics, 3/6 for sound, 4/6 toughness, 4/6 for staying power, and 4/6 for value, saying it was ""[s]plit fairly and squarely between adventure and arcade"", and noting that the game's audiovisual qualities were above average for a budget title; he also compared it to Sorcery in its focus on acquiring spells and items to overcome enemies and obstacles. He concluded that the Doriath was ""[a] good helping of entertainment for those itching to get lost in a labyrinth.""   Zzap!’s two reviewers were somewhat split; Gary Penn called it ""[a] fairly competent release and certainly a lot better than the other Rabbit/Virgin game, Zyto"", but found the wizard’s jumping controls awkward and the game as a whole ""overpriced for what it offers"". Julian Rignall, on the other hand, called it ""a pretty gruesome game"", saying that the graphics were ""very poor"" and ""badly animated"", and also found the music ""grating"". He also said ""[t]he instructions are very poor, with practically no indication of what you’re supposed to do"", concluding that publisher Rabbit Software would have to ""get their act together"" in the future. The magazine gave the game a mediocre overall score of 47%, concluding that it was ""[n]ot one of the better arcade adventures available but even so there’s a lot worse.""

A retrospective article from Retro Gamer said it is still ""tremendous fun to explore & track down the spell amulets needed to kill the various types of monster that range from snakes to dragons and kraken"" but noted a long-standing rumor (apparently unconfirmed) that the game is ""impossible to fully complete due to a missing amulet."" In another retrospective, Kotaku also looked back on the game fondly, likening it to Metroid. Doriath Dungeon describes the game in great detail, including confirming that there is an ending, achievable despite the missing amulet.

History
Joseph Hibbert was a brass founder and maker of gauges and taps. These skills were used to produce heald sizing  equipment, including the Shirley box sizer under licence. Sizing was an essential part of the weaving process for cotton. The warp had to be stiffened before it passed through the heald, This was done by coating it with size. After weaving the size had to be removed.

In the recession of the 1930s, Platt Brothers, Howard and Bullough, Brooks and Doxey, Asa Lees, Dobson and Barlow, Joseph Hibbert, John Hetherington and Tweedales and Smalley merged to become  Textile Machinery Makers Ltd., but the individual units continued to trade under their own names until the 1970, when they were rationalised into one company called Platt UK Ltd. In 1991 the company name changed to Platt Saco Lowell.

718,391525,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis%20Gass%C3%A9e,Jean-Louis Gassée,"Jean-Louis Gassée (born March 1944 in Paris, France) is a business executive. He is best known as a former executive at Apple Computer, where he worked from 1981 to 1990. He also founded Be Inc., creators of the BeOS computer operating system. After leaving Be, he became Chairman of PalmSource, Inc. in November 2004.

Career

1980s: Apple Computer
Gassée worked for six years at Hewlett-Packard from 1968 to 1974, where he was responsible for overseeing the launching of the company’s first desktop scientific computer and the development of its sales organization in France, before his promotion to Sales Manager of Europe, in Geneva, Switzerland.  From 1974 to 1981, Gassée served as the Chief Executive Officer of the French affiliates of Data General and Exxon Office Systems.

In 1981, Gassée became Director of European Operations at Apple Computer.  In 1985, after learning of Steve Jobs's plan to oust CEO John Sculley over Memorial Day weekend while Sculley was in China, Gassée preemptively informed the board of directors, which eventually led to Jobs's resignation from Apple.

Later, Sculley personally appointed Gassée to Jobs's old position as head of Macintosh development. Gassée introduced several Macintosh products on-stage in the late 1980s including the Macintosh Portable in 1989, and also the Macintosh IIfx. In his product introductions, he was often very comical. Gassée was less formal than many executives. He wore tailored suits when necessary, but he often addressed employees wearing a black (lambskin) leather jacket and a single diamond-stud earring .

When the idea of licensing the Mac OS for other companies use was brought up by various members of Apple, Jean-Louis refused to give in to the idea, maintaining that the Macintosh was more powerful than any other computer at the present, and had a superior architectural roadmap for future expansion than any other computer. Although many of the companies were interested (such as AT&T, for the use of the OS in their own equipment—they were so interested in this idea that the then-CEO of AT&T made a personal phone call to Sculley), Gassée would have none of it, and so the idea of licensing the Mac OS was shelved.

In the mid-1980s, Gassée started the skunkworks project to create what eventually became the Newton MessagePad.

In 1987, Apple CEO John Sculley published his memoir Odyssey. In the hope of inspiring ""excellence,"" he ordered a hardback copy for each Apple employee, at Apple's expense. Shortly afterward, Gassée ordered a paperback copy of Fred Brooks's The Mythical Man-Month for all product-development employees, in the hope of inspiring good sense in project management. Brooks gave a lecture at nearby De Anza College: the room was filled with Apple employees with copies of his book, who told him stories that confirmed his conclusions.

In 1988, Gassée became head of Apple's advanced product development and worldwide marketing, and rumors of his taking over as president of Apple from Sculley were circling. Other rumors concerning Michael Spindler were also circulating. At one point in 1990, a number of Apple employees held a demonstration, marching around in circles, carrying signs, on the lawn in front of one Apple building, to petition Apple management to retain Gassée. A USA Today reporter saw the demonstration and asked an employee what it was about. The employee, well aware of Apple's rules on divulging trade secrets to the press, succinctly explained the issues. The next day, USA Today reported that Apple employees, many wearing black leather jackets and berets in honor of Gassée, had demonstrated to persuade management to keep him at Apple. In fact, the only person wearing a leather jacket (a brown goatskin A-2) and a beret had been the person whom she had asked to explain the purpose of the demonstration.

In 1989, Gassée successfully killed a Claris project, 'Drama', which aimed to start a new brand to sell low-end Macintosh computers. Gassée argued that consumers would continue to be willing to pay the price premium for a full Macintosh experience.

Despite Gassée's efforts and those of his supporters, in 1990 he left Apple, forced out by Sculley and Apple board members dissatisfied with his performance in delivering new products. Spindler got the top job.

1991–2002: Be Incorporated
In 1991, Gassée started a new venture, Be Inc., with the ambitious goal of creating an entire new computer platform, hardware and software, from the ground up. A number of Apple employees left with him, including Steve Sakoman, the developer of the Apple Newton. Be developed a new operating system, optimized for multiple CPUs and multithreaded applications, which became known simply as ""the Be Operating System,"" or BeOS.

BeOS was written for Be's own dual-processor machine, the BeBox; later development releases of BeOS were ported to run on the Macintosh, and Macintosh clone makers, including Power Computing and Motorola, signed deals to ship BeOS with their hardware when the OS was finalized. In light of this, Be stopped production on the BeBox after selling only around 2000 units, and focused entirely on development of BeOS.

In 1996, Apple Computer decided to abandon Copland, the project to rewrite and modernize the Macintosh operating system. BeOS had many of the features Apple sought, and around Christmas time they offered to buy Be for $120 million, later raising their bid to $200 million. However, despite estimates of Be's total worth at approximately $80 million, Gassée held out for $275 million, and Apple balked. In a surprise move, Apple went on to purchase NeXT, the company their former co-founder Steve Jobs had earlier left Apple to found, for $429 million, with the high price justified by Apple getting Jobs and his NeXT engineers in tow. NeXTSTEP was used as the basis for their new operating system, Mac OS X.

After the return of Jobs, Apple withdrew the license to make Macintosh clones. With Intel's assistance, BeOS moved to ""Plan B"", a port to the x86 platform. While it arguably never grew past a cult following, it sold enough copies to have a nascent development and user community, and had several thousand programs available for it, including several dozen commercial products. BeOS was also used as an embedded operating system in multimedia production systems from Edirol, TEAC and Level Control Systems. However, partially due to behind-the-scenes pressure from Microsoft, Be was not successful in getting top-tier OEMs to bundle BeOS with their hardware - only Hitachi and AST (who were major in Europe at the time) did so - which Gassée saw as fundamental to their success.

At the end of 1999, Be had a ""focus shift,"" giving their desktop OS away for free (with commercial distributions sold by third-party vendors, similar to Linux distributions) to focus on BeIA, a build of BeOS specifically targeted to internet appliances. The company lost several employees who disagreed with this strategy and who had no desire to work on an appliance OS. While there was vendor interest in BeIA and at least one shipping product based on it (the Sony eVilla), the market for internet appliances proved to be nearly non-existent, and Be laid off most of its employees in 2001, with its assets and the remaining engineers being bought by Palm, Inc. for $11 million that August. Gassée stayed on through that transition, but left in January 2002.

2002–present: After Be, Inc.
After leaving Be, Gassée served as president and CEO of Computer Access Technology Corporation (CATC), a company which made network protocol analyzers, but left within a year (CATC was purchased in fall 2004 by LeCroy Corporation, a competitor). Gassée resurfaced as a general partner at Allegis Capital, a venture capital fund based in Palo Alto, California, where he is still in position.

In November 2004, Gassée became chairman of PalmSource, Inc., where several former Be executives and engineers still worked. BeOS technology was being worked on for use in Palm OS ""Cobalt"" (Version 6), but as of February 2006, there were no major customers—including Palm, Inc. itself—who have committed to using the Cobalt release.

In March 2006, he started writing a blog (in French) called Le blog de Jean-Louis Gassée (or, in English: Jean-Louis Gassée's Blog). The blog was active for a month and contains only four entries.

He was seen at a Google Tech Talk in February 2007.

In 2009, he started contributing regularly to the Monday Note blog, a newsletter covering the intersection of media and technology.

In 2010, Gassée says he was asked by Nokia to consult on the future of the company. He suggested Nokia fire CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo and drop its Symbian operating system in favour of Google's Android.

The Snake Park is in Parassinikkadavu, which is  from National Highway (NH) 17, en route from Kannur to Taliparamba.

Snakes on Exhibition
The park houses a variety of snakes and other small animals, including the Spectacled cobra, King Cobra, Russell's viper, Krait and various pit vipers. There is also a large collection of non-venomous snakes including pythons. The park is dedicated to the preservation and conservation of snakes, many species of which are gradually becoming extinct. In a live show, trained personnel play and 'interact' with a variety of snakes, including cobras and vipers, and try to quell mythical fears and superstitions about snakes.  It has also been proposed that a laboratory to extract venom from snakes for purposes of research be set up here.

Snake Bite Treatment Center
Pappinisseri Visha Chikitsa Society (Snake Bite Treatment Center) was started in the year 1964 at Pappinisseri, Kannur, Kerala with an intention to treat the ailing especially those suffering from snake envenomation. This institution is commemorated on behalf of the Late Sri. C.P. Kumaran Vaidyar and functions as the center for advanced clinical Research and literary documentation in Agada Tantra. Ever since its inception in 1964 it had the monopoly in treating snake bite cases and more than a million snake bite cases were treated and clinically documented.

The main physician for Pappinisseri Visha Chikitsa Kendra was Dr B Prabhakaran for a long time.

Destruction of the park - 1993

This park has a long back story of destruction which owed to a political revenge. The political issues lead the party followers to vandalise and set fire to the park. Many rare species of reptiles like 2 king cobras, other birds and animals were brutally burnt to death.

727,17307352,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney%20Richmond%20Burleigh,Sydney Richmond Burleigh,"Sydney Richmond Burleigh (July 7, 1853 – February 25, 1931) was an American artist, known primarily for his watercolors but also for his oil paintings, drawings, illustrations, and building and furniture designs.

Biography
He was born in Little Compton, Rhode Island, a descendant of the Pilgrim William Bradford.  In 1875, he married Sarah Drew Wilkinson (1851–1952) and, with her encouragement and wealth, became a full-time artist.  He studied in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens from 1876 to 1880 and then returned to Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life.

Burleigh rose to national prominence after receiving a bronze medal at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904 and an open prize from the Buffalo Society of Artists in 1913.  He exhibited regularly at the Boston Art Club, the Providence Art Club, as well as the National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Newport Art Museum.

He also worked as an illustrator and collaborated with writer William Henry Frost on several children’s books.

He was a painter in the realist style, consistent with the academic style of his teacher, Laurens.   Mabel Ducasse, an art critic for the Providence Journal, wrote of Burleigh’s art that ""there is a quality in his work which suggests that of the masters of the Renaissance when they chose to employ line and wash.  It is character — born of perfect certainty of touch and flowing freedom of line.  It is seldom achieved by modern watercolorists, who most often mistake the function of their medium, which is that of drawing rather than painting.""

A man of versatile creativity, Burleigh designed the Fleur-de-lys Studios in Providence in collaboration with the architect Edmund Russell Willson of Stone, Carpenter, and Willson.  Built in 1885 in conjunction with the Art Workers Guild, the building was to be used for art studios, including Burleigh’s own.  It is an important monument to the American Arts and Crafts Movement and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992.  It is now owned by the Providence Art Club, and retains its original purpose as artist' studios.

Another of his studios was a unique and eccentric little building known as the ""Peggotty.""  Burleigh built it over the hull of a small sailboat that had been used as a ferry between Little Compton and Middletown, Rhode Island.  It featured a thatched roof, and today it is on display at the Little Compton Historical Society.

Burleigh was a leading member of the art community in Rhode Island.  He was a founder of the Providence Art Club in 1880 and was the first president of the Providence Watercolor Club.  He had a long association with the Rhode Island School of Design, serving on the board of directors (1887–1893), as a teacher (1897–1906), and as a trustee (1919–1931).  He received an honorary degree from Brown University in 1912.

His works are held in several private and public collections, including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the museums at Brown University, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Rhode Island Historical Society, the Little Compton Historical Society, and the Henry Ford collection in Dearborn, Michigan.www.henryford.org

732,748636,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy%20Warlock,Billy Warlock,"Billy Warlock (born William Alan Leming; March 26, 1961) is an American actor known for playing Eddie Kramer, a lifeguard on the first two seasons of Baywatch and in the reunion movie in 2003, as well as for numerous daytime roles, most notably Frankie Brady on Days of Our Lives and A.J. Quartermaine on General Hospital.

Early life
Warlock was born William Alan Leming in Gardena, California, the son of Dick Warlock, a successful Hollywood stunt man who did stunts for Kurt Russell and was the stunt driver in the Disney picture, The Love Bug. His siblings include Lance Warlock and a sister, Rhonda. After graduation from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California in 1979, Dick got him a stunt job as Robin Williams's stunt double in a Mork & Mindy episode, one that was produced by Garry Marshall. Several months later, he auditioned for Marshall and won his first major television role as Leopold ""Flip"" Phillips, Roger's brother (and the Cunninghams' younger nephew), in the tenth season of Happy Days.

Career
As a young adult, Warlock had a small role in Halloween II (1981), and Lovely But Deadly (1981), directed by David Sheldon.  He later appeared in Hotshot (1987), directed by Rick King, and played the lead role in the horror film Society (1989), directed by Brian Yuzna. The same year, Warlock appeared as an original cast member of Baywatch, where he played lifeguard Eddie Kramer for the first three seasons. In the early 1990s, he also was on the short-lived TV Series The Hat Squad, with Nestor Serrano and Don Michael Paul from 1992 to 1993, and portrayed Lyle Menendez in the 1994 television movie Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders.

He also starred on soap operas such as Days of Our Lives and General Hospital. In the latter, he portrayed A. J. Quartermaine from June 13, 1997, to December 11, 2003, and for several visits in 2005 from February 4 to February 11, when his character was presumed dead. He reprised the role from March 15 until April 26 when his character was actually murdered in his hospital room by Dr. Asher Thomas (Larry Poindexter) after he kidnapped his biological son, Michael Corinthos (Dylan Cash).

On Days of Our Lives, Warlock portrayed Frankie Brady from 1986 to 1988, from 1990 to 1991, and again beginning in June 2005. In 1988, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his performance on the series. He was let go from the soap and his final airdate was November 2006. In spring 2007, he joined the cast of The Young and the Restless in the role of Ben Hollander, Jack Abbott's campaign manager.  Warlock appeared on the show from May 2007 to January 2008.

In 2003, Warlock reprised his role of Eddie Kramer in the Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding television film. The following year, he appeared in an off-Broadway revival production of The Normal Heart at the Public Theater in New York City. Charles Isherwood of Variety praised his performance as ""sincere and nicely understated."" During the summer of 2010, Warlock appeared on As the World Turns as Anthony Blackthorn.

Personal life
Warlock was once engaged to Erika Eleniak, his Baywatch co-star, who portrayed Shauni McClain. He was married to soap actress Marcy Walker, but later divorced.  He married former Days of our Lives and As the World Turns co-star Julie Pinson on August 26, 2006, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

733,47630492,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda%20Ryan,Linda Ryan,"Linda Maree Ryan (born 25 August 1966 in Brisbane) is an Australian sport shooter. She has been selected to compete for Australia in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and has collected a total of thirteen medals in a major international competition, spanning the ISSF World Cup series, the Oceanian Championships, and the Commonwealth Games. Ryan also trains under head coach Anatoliy Babushkin for the national team, while shooting at her home club, Outtrim Pistol Club in South Gippsland, Victoria.

Ryan's Olympic debut came as part of the host nation team in pistol shooting when Australia hosted the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. There, she finished in a three-way tie with U.S. shooter Christina Cassidy and Georgia's Nino Uchadze for twenty-eighth place in the qualifying round of the women's air pistol, shooting a total of 375 points. Ryan had also eluded from her dramatic air pistol aim to fire a much brilliant 579 (290 in precision and 289 in the rapid fire) for an eleventh-place tie with three other shooters, including 1988 Olympic champion Nino Salukvadze of Georgia in the sport pistol, but her qualifying score was not good enough for her to surpass the final cutoff by two points.

In 2002, Ryan showed her most potential form in bouncing back to the range at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, claiming her first individual silver medal in sport pistol. She also set a new Games record with a combined score of 1150 to share a superb victory with former Belarusian shooter and 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Lalita Yauhleuskaya in the pairs.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Ryan qualified for her second Australian team only in the women's 10 m air pistol. She beat her fellow markswoman and 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Annemarie Forder at the Olympic trials in Sydney to snatch the Olympic quota place that the latter won from the Oceanian Championships in Auckland, having registered a minimum qualifying score of 380. She fired a substandard 376 out of a possible 400 to force in a two-way tie with Iran's Nasim Hassanpour for twenty-eighth in a field of forty-one shooters, matching her position from the previous Games.

740,47684730,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoporum%20brevipes,Myoporum brevipes,"Myoporum brevipes, commonly known as the pale myoporum, is a plant in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae. It is sometimes a prostrate, others an erect shrub. Its branches and leaves are warty and it has white or pink flowers, often spotted, followed by succulent white fruits. It generally grows in arid areas in South Australia but has also been found in Victoria and Western Australia.

Description
Myoporum brevipes is a shrub, sometimes prostrate, others erect and spreading. It grows to a height of  high and has wart-like tubercles covering its branches and leaves. The leaves are arranged alternately and are thick, often fleshy,  long,  wide. They are variable in shape but often egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base.

The flowers are arranged in groups of 1 to 5 in the axils of the leaves and have 5 sepals and 5 white or pink petals joined at their base to form a tube and often spotted with pink or purple. The tube is  long and the lobes are  long and warty. There are 4 stamens which extend beyond the petals. Flowering occurs between October and February and is followed by white fruits which are drupes,  in diameter and oval or roughly spherical in shape.

Taxonomy and naming
Myoporum brevipes was first formally described in 1870 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis from a specimen collected on an expedition of John McDouall Stuart. The specific epithet (brevipes) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning ""short"" and pes meaning ""foot"",""probably referring to the short pedicels (flower stalks) in the material available to Bentham.""

Distribution and habitat
Myoporum brevipes occurs mainly in South Australia, although there are small populations in Western Australia. It is very rare in Victoria with only a few individual plants near Boinka. It grows in sandy soils containing calcium carbonate on sand dunes or near saline lakes and often in disturbed situations such as roadsides.

Conservation
Myoporum brevipes is classified as not threatened in Western Australia or South Australia but is classified as endangered in Victoria.

741,29861121,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Stonemason%27s%20Yard,The Stonemason's Yard,"The Stonemason's Yard (formally known as Campo S. Vidal and Santa Maria della Carità) is an early oil painting by Giovanni Antonio Canal, better known as Canaletto.  It depicts an informal scene in Venice, looking over a temporary stonemason's yard in the Campo San Vidal set up for the construction of Andrea Tirali's facade of the church of San Vidal, and across the Grand Canal towards the church of Santa Maria della Carità.  Painted in the mid to late 1720s, it is now in the collection of The National Gallery in London and is considered one of Canaletto's finest works.

Description
The painting measures .  It depicts a Venetian scene looking roughly southwest over a temporary stonemason's yard situated in an open space beside the Grand Canal known as the Campo San Vidal (""campo"", literally field, used in Venice to denote a small open space).  Several masons are at work shaping and carving stone probably destined for the reconstruction of the nearby church of San Vidal (immediately behind the viewer and so not visible in the painting; its Palladian façade was renovated in the 1730s) or possibly for the embellishment of a nearby palazzo (the Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti and Palazzo Barbaro are close by, to the viewer's left).  The side of the medieval church of Santa Maria della Carità, reconstructed in the 1440s, stands on the opposite bank of the Grand Canal, to the left of the façade of the Scuola Grande della Carità; the tower of the church of San Trovaso is visible rising over the rooftops in the distance.

In addition to the architectural details, The Stonemason's Yard shows scenes of daily life in Venice, probably in the early morning: a cock crows on a windowsill to the lower left, and sunlight streams in from the left behind the viewer's (east).  The mainly domestic buildings are generally in poor repair, with typical Venetian flared chimney-pots.  Laundry hangs from many of the windows, and potted plants stand on several balconies.  One woman is using a distaff and drop spindle to spin thread on a balcony to the right; another draws water from a well in the campo beside a wooden shed, from a well-head shaped like the capital of a column.  Two children are playing in the foreground to the left: one is falling over and urinating involuntarily in surprise, as a woman lunges forward to catch him; another woman looks down from a balcony above.  A gondola with canopied cabin passes on the canal, with others moored on either bank.

Unsigned and undated, the painting is attributed and dated by stylistic clues.  It seems to combine features of Canaletto's early and mature styles, for example in the use of two undercolours, and is a very early example the use of Prussian blue in oil painting. Canaletto painted The Stonemason's Yard before 1730 while Prussian blue was discovered by Johann Jacob Diesbach in 1704. Amongst other pigments used by Canaletto in this painting were Naples yellow, lead white and ochres.

The informal scene is thought to have been painted for a Venetian patron, rather than a foreign visitor to Venice, in the mid- to late 1720s. Unlike many views painted by Canaletto and his fellow vedutisti, the location has changed significantly since the 1720s.  The view of the opposite bank of the Grand Canal is now blocked by the high arch of the modern wooden Accademia bridge, and the church of the Carità has been much altered.  The campanile fell down in 1744, demolishing the houses beside the canal in front, and much of the other stonework has been removed.  The nave became the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in the 1800s, and the Gallerie dell'Accademia is housed in the Scuola.  The Campo remains an open space, with the well-head at its centre.  The domestic building to the right remains standing.

Provenance
The early ownership of The Stonemason's Yard is not known.  It was in the collection of Sir George Beaumont by 1808, and was one of the paintings Beaumont donated to the British Museum in 1823, to form the nucleus of the National Gallery's nascent collection.  It passed to the National Gallery in 1828, where it continues to be exhibited.  It was extensively cleaned by John Seguier in 1852 – so extensively that a Select Committee investigated the cleaning practices of the National Gallery – and was cleaned again in 1955, and then restored, relined and remounted in 1989.  Some early retouchings, clouds now concealed under later glazings, may have been done in Beaumont's time by John Constable.

750,40601281,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare%20Viazzi,Cesare Viazzi,"Cesare Viazzi (1857 – 1943) was an Italian painter.

Biography
Born in Alessandria, he was initially a student of the sculptor and architect Angelo Cavanna in Novi Ligure. He then became a pupil of Andrea Gastaldi, first in Rome then at the Accademia Albertina in Turin. In 1893, he was named professor of the Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti in Genoa. Among his pupils was Pietro Gaudenzi.
 
In Genoa, he was known for his portraits, but also completed large fresco or decorative cycles, including for the Società promotrice di Belle Arti, Palazzo Raggio in via Balbi, Castello Raggio a Cornigliano, Villa Weil, and the Villa Bisio in Albaro. He painted sacred subjects for chapels in the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno.

At the 1883 Exposition of Rome, he exhibited a canvas of Il Beccaio. In the 1884 Turin, exhibition, he displayed: La vanità nei campi; Fiori di biancospino; La Scrivia; Il giorno di San Bovo; Ore calde. In 1887, in Venice: Un pescatore sul lago; Idillio; Mar. In 1888, in Bologna: Autunno mesto; Fede; Fiori. Among other works Il Canto del mattino and Ritorno dai campi

The contemporary critic Ercole Arturo Marescotti described his paintings at the Promotrice di Genoa: 
The paintings of Viazzi portray the truth of the environment: what first impresses the observer: is the truth that most stubbornly look for in the abstruse, in the baroque, and almost despise them for failing to remain modest and simple: the truth of which you can overcome without studying the great and true mastery that is nature: ... Passionate lover of the truth, the atmosphere, but to arrive (there you have) sacrifice (the reality) for the effect, I would say almost to destroy the color found there, Viazzi well shows that what worries him most is not only vulgar effect ... and much less complacency before the intonation: his only care, his only study, is the tone, the totality of the painting. .. He cares very little to talk to the eye, but seeks, puts all his concerns, because his painting speaks to the heart.

He died in Predosa in 1943.

755,38714359,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Fanning%20%28journalist%29,David Fanning (journalist),"David E. Fanning (born 25 May 1946) is a South African American journalist and filmmaker. He was the executive producer of the investigative documentary series Frontline since its first season in 1983 to his retirement in 2015. He has won eight Emmy Awards and in 2013 received a Lifetime Achievement  Emmy in honor of his work.

Career
He began his filmmaking career as a young journalist in South Africa. His first films, Amabandla AmaAfrika (1970) and The Church and Apartheid (1972), produced for BBC-TV, dealt with race and religion in his troubled homeland. He came to the U.S. in 1973 and began producing and directing local and national documentaries for KOCE, a public television station in California. His film 'Deep South, Deep North' (1973) was a PBS/BBC co-production and the first in a long succession of collaborations between U.S. and European television, especially the British. In 1977, Fanning came to WGBH Boston to start the international documentary series WORLD.  As executive producer, he produced and presented over 50 films for PBS in five years. With director Antony Thomas, Fanning produced and co-wrote Death of a Princess (1980). Then in 1982, again with Thomas, he produced Frank Terpil: Confessions of a Dangerous Man, which won the Emmy Award for best investigative documentary.

In 1982, Fanning began the development of Frontline. The series has worked with well over 200 producers and as many journalists, covering a wide range of domestic and foreign stories.  Its signature has been to combine good reporting with good filmmaking.

With Fanning's encouragement, one of Frontlines singular achievements has been its embrace of the Internet. In 1995, Frontline developed one of the first deep content web sites in history. By putting interviews, documents and additional editorial materials on the web, the series made its journalism transparent, and changed the nature and content of broadcast journalism. Rather than an ephemeral one-time transmission, the documentaries and all their ancillary materials are now preserved on the series website. In 2013, there are over 150 hours of full-length documentaries streamed on the series website, one of the largest sites of its kind. Fanning is quoted saying, ""This is the great promise of public media. This is where we hold our work for the future, our public library, our contribution to the intellectual commons.""

In 2001, Fanning's determination to bring more foreign stories to American audiences led to the creation of Frontline/World, a television magazine-style series of programs designed to encourage a new, younger generation of producers and reporters. The emphasis has been on bringing a largely unreported world to viewers through a series of journeys and encounters. Like its counterpart series, Frontline/World has made a deep commitment to its website, offering original web-exclusive video and reporting by graduate journalism students and an international network of correspondents. Fanning sees it as a prototype for the future, and a place to build a community of enterprising journalists.

In 2015,  Fanning retired as executive producer of Frontline after 33 seasons. He's now at large and the current executive producer is Raney Aronson-Rath.

Awards and honors
In 2004, Fanning received the Columbia Journalism Award, the highest honor awarded by the faculty of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, recognizing ""Singular journalistic performance in the public interest... David Fanning and his signature program, Frontline, have turned a commitment to probing journalism and public service into an enduring national conversation, without which far too many important issues would remain veiled or hidden altogether."" In 2010, Fanning was honored by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting with the Ralph Lowell Award, public television's most prestigious award, recognizing ""outstanding contributions"" to the field.  That same year Fanning was also honored with the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism by the Shorenstein Center at the Harvard Kennedy School.

In 2013, on Frontlines 30th anniversary, Fanning received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award.

757,61574313,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candelaria%20border%20incursion%20of%201919,Candelaria border incursion of 1919,"The Candelaria border incursion of 1919 was a US military invasion of Mexico to find, engage and neutralize a Mexican bandit group led by Jesús Rentería. Rentería had kidnapped two United States Army Border Air Patrol pilots that had crashed south of the US-Mexican border and successfully ransomed them back to the United States.

Background
The U.S. and Mexico had for almost a decade seen a number of violent incidents on their border related to the Mexican Revolution and the Bandit War. As recently as June 1919 U.S. and Mexican forces skirmished near El Paso, Texas, on the border in what was known as the Battle of Ciudad Juárez. This conflict is singular for the fact that the Mexican army and the U.S. Army joined forces to fight the Villista revolutionary faction led by Pancho Villa. It was the second-largest battle of the Mexican Revolution involving the United States, and is considered the last battle of the Border War.

Incursion

United States Army Border Air Patrol pilots, Lt Harold G. Peterson, pilot, and Paul H. Davis, observer-gunner from Marfa Field, Texas, were on a routine patrol in the Big Bend area of Texas on Sunday morning, 10 August 1919.  Their mission was to patrol along the Rio Grande from Lajitas to Bosque Bonito and then land at Fort Bliss. Coming to the mouth of the Rio Conchos at Ojinaga, Chihuahua, they mistook the Conches for the Rio Grande and followed it many miles into Mexico before being forced down by engine trouble. Thinking they were still on the Rio Grande, the airmen picked a spot on the “American” side of the river to land. The terrain was rough and the plane was wrecked. Having buried the machine guns and ammunition to keep them out of the hands of bandits, Peterson and Davis started walking down the river, thinking they would come to the U.S. Cavalry outpost at Candelaria, Texas.

When Peterson and Davis did not arrive at Fort Bliss on Sunday afternoon, the men there assumed they had either returned to Marfa Field or made a forced landing. When they were unaccounted for on Monday, a search was begun. Flying over the patrol route, 1st Lts. Frank Estell and Russell H. Cooper surmised that Peterson and Davis might have mistakenly followed the Conches into Mexico. The region along the Conches almost as far as Chihuahua City was added to the area covered by search planes. Tuesday afternoon Peterson and Davis saw a plane flying up the Conches, but they were in thick brush and could not attract the crew's attention. The search continued until Sunday, 17 August 1919. Then Capt. Leonard F. ('Two- Gun') Matlack, commanding Troop K, 8th Cavalry, at Candelaria, received word Peterson and Davis were being held for ransom.

The flyers had been taken prisoner on Wednesday, 13 August by a Villista named Jesús Rentería. The bandit sent the ransom note to a rancher at Candelaria, along with telegrams which he forced the airmen to write to their fathers and the U.S. Secretary of War, the Commanding General of the Southern Department, and the commanding officer of U.S. forces in the Big Bend District. Rentería demanded $15,000 ($ in ) not later than Monday, 18 August, or the two Americans would be killed.

The War Department authorized payment of the ransom, but there remained the matter of getting $15,000 in cash for delivery before the deadline. Ranchers in the area quickly subscribed the full amount, which came from the Marfa National Bank. Negotiation through intermediaries resulted in a plan for Captain Matlack to cross the border Monday night with half of the ransom money for the release of one of the captives. The meeting took place on schedule, and within forty-five minutes Matlack came back with Lieutenant Peterson.

Matlack then took the remaining $7,500 to get Lieutenant Davis. On the way to the rendezvous he overheard two of Rentería's men talking about killing him and Davis as soon as the rest of the ransom money was paid. At the rendezvous, Matlack pulled a gun, told the Mexicans to tell Rentería to “go to hell,” and rode off with Davis and the money. Avoiding the ambush, Matlack and Davis safely crossed into the United States. Questioned by Col. George T. Langhome, Army Commander in the Big Bend District, Peterson and Davis maintained they had been captured on the American side of the border and had not crossed into Mexico.

At daybreak on Tuesday, August 19, 1919, Captain Matlack once again crossed the border, this time leading Troops C and K, 8th Cavalry, in pursuit of Rentería and his men. Air Service planes scouted ahead of the cavalry seeking to spot the bandits. They also gathered information on the condition of the trails and the location of waterholes, and conveyed it to the troops by dropping messages. The men troops of the 8th Cavalry came upon a blockhouse and were fired from those inside. The men stormed the house killing four, capturing two and two others were able to escape in the confusion. The Arizona Republican listed three of the four Mexicans killed as Jesus Janir, Francisco Janir and Jose Fuentes.

While flying some twelve or fifteen miles west of Candelaria late Tuesday afternoon, Lieutenants Estell and Cooper saw three horsemen in a canyon and went lower for a better look. When the men on the ground fired on the DH-4, Estell made another pass with his machine guns blazing. Then Cooper opened up with his Lewis Guns and killed one of the men, reportedly Renteria.

The search for members of Rentería's men continued until 23 August. With the Mexican government of Venustiano Carranza protesting the invasion of its territory, U.S. forces returned to the United States.

Aftermath

In 1920 the President of the United States authorized Captain Leonard F. Matlack to be granted the position and rank of captain on the retired list.

760,1449094,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan%20Welsh,Jonathan Welsh,"Jonathan Welsh (April 3, 1947 – January 27, 2005) was a veteran Canadian actor of stage, television and film, best known for his principal roles in Canadian television series, notably the 1986–1989 adventure comedy Adderly and the 1989–1994 journalism drama E.N.G..

On E.N.G., Welsh portrayed Eric ""Mac"" MacFarlane, one of the first openly gay characters in North American series television, a source of considerable pride for the actor.

He also appeared in the 1979 movie City on Fire which was Canada's attempt to enter the disaster movie era. The movie was a critical and box office failure. His other film credits included roles in Agency (1980), Nothing Personal (1980), All in Good Taste (1983) and The Surrogate (1984).

His acting career began in theatre in the 1960s, with roles at the Shaw and Stratford festivals and in the 1969 Canadian debut of Hair at the Royal Alexandra Theatre.

In 1990, Welsh founded Performers for Literacy, an acclaimed national charity that encourages children to read with interactive shows and readings, and with Second Story Reading Centres in Toronto and Edmonton.

Toward the end of his life, he moved from Toronto to Belleville, Ontario, where he died in his sleep after a short illness. He was survived by his wife Heather and three children, Hilary, Owen and Julia.

762,27462467,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acors%20Barns%20House,Acors Barns House,"The Acors Barns House is located in New London, Connecticut. Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival house with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade of the house is five bays wide with a Greek Revival portico leading to the main entrance. Additions to the house include a projecting center dormer, and second-story projection over a partially enclosed veranda. The plain exterior is contrasted by interior's elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces.

In 1862, Barns died and the house was passed to his sons before being transferred to Harriet Barns Vincent. The house was sold to Julia O'Sullivan in 1919 before being sold to Francis McGuire in 1956. The McGuire's operated the house as a law firm and passed the title to James McGuire. In 2013, James McGuire sold the house to the Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut. Dave Collins wrote that the Acors Barns house is a ""fine and rare example"" of architecture that is especially important to New London, Connecticut. The Acors Barns House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 22, 1976.

Acors Barns 
Born in 1794, Acors Barns was the son a mariner and lived in Westerly, Rhode Island before moving to Stonington, Connecticut. Barns moved to New London, Connecticut and formed a whaling company with William Williams Jr. in 1827. The company prospered and became one of the largest firms in the city, but Barns avoided the 1849 decline of the whaling industry by investing elsewhere. Barns invested in the Willimantic and Palmer Railroad before establishing the Bank of Commerce in 1852. Barns died in 1862, but his sons would continue the successful Bank of Commerce.

Design 
Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival house with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade of the house is five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main entrance has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.

Modifications to the house include the addition of a large pediment-shaped dormer that projects from the center of the main roof and is lighted by a rectangular double window. Part of the veranda was enclosed and the stairs that lead to a formal garden were removed. Above the center of the veranda is a second-story projection that was described as visually compromising the elegance of the rear facade.

The plain exterior is contrasted by the elegance of the interior of the house. The house has elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces. The floor plan is built around the central hall with an offset stairway. The parlor rooms to the right are separated by a wide archway. The two rooms to the left are a dining room and a pantry that has a dumbwaiter to the kitchen in the cellar. The National Historic Register of Places nomination noted that the cellar contained the ""remains of the kitchen, washroom and wine cellar"". The second floor is made of four chambers and the attic consists of five small rooms. The attic's rooms served as the servants' cubicles.

Owners 
The Acors Barns House has gone through several owners over its lifetime. In 1862, the house passed from Acors Barns to his son William H. Barns. In 1893, the second son, Charles Barns acquired the title to the house and transferred it upon his death to Harriet Barns Vincent, the daughter of his sister. Harriet Barns Vincent sold the house to Julia O'Sullivan in 1919. Francis McGuire purchased the house in 1956 and it would later pass to James McGuire. In 2013, James McGuire sold the house to the Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut for $325,000. The foundation stated it would continue to preserve the house's historical integrity.

Importance 
Clouette writes, ""The Barns house physically documents the symbiosis by which the wealthy and the propertyless shared a home. Its value as an artifact is enhanced by the successful reuse which has retained the character of the building."" Dave Collins of The Day wrote, ""The Barns house is also especially important to New London because it is such a fine and rare example of the architectural fabric of the big swath of the downtown that was demolished in urban renewal in the 1960s.""

He became in 1847 a professor of toxicology and chemistry at the École supérieure de Pharmacie at Strasbourg. Because of his participation in the demonstration on ""revolutionary day"" 13 June 1849, he was forced to leave France, subsequently settling in Switzerland. In 1849 he became a professor of physics and chemistry at Lausanne, and in 1852 a chemist to a Turkey red factory near Manchester. In 1855 he was granted amnesty and returned to France. In 1868 he was named a professor of technology at Turin (Regio Museo Industriale italiano), and finally, in 1871, a professor of technical chemistry at the Federal Polytechnic Institute Zurich, today the ETH Zurich. He died in Zurich.

He conducted experiments  with arsenic acid as a discharge agent and filed patents for the employment of arsenic and phosphoric acids in discharge printing of fabrics. In 1844 he reportedly was the first to discover red phosphorus; his findings taking place prior to Anton Schrötter's discovery of the substance during the following year.

With Pompejus Bolley, he published ""Traité des matières colorantes artificielles dérivées du goudron de houille"" (1874, ""Treatise on artificial dyes derived from coal tar"").

764,46582284,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron%20Park%20%28Waco%29,Cameron Park (Waco),"Cameron Park is a  urban park located in Waco, Texas. The park was dedicated on May 27, 1910, and named in memory of Waco philanthropist and lumber baron William Cameron. The park also contains Waco's  zoo, the Cameron Park Zoo.

History
In the early 20th century, as Waco continued to develop as the urban heart of McLennan County and the progressive movement was rising throughout America, Waco citizens began to clamor for more parks and green spaces to be preserved for public use. Many wanted to make Proctor Springs, a popular gathering site near the Brazos River that had become subject to commercialization around the turn of the century, the site of a new city park. Before the city could act, the land was purchased for $25,000 by a businessman, W.C. Lawson. Despite this apparent setback, the hopes of Wacoans to preserve Proctor Springs were not lost; on May 24, 1910, Flora B. Cameron, wife of the late William Cameron, announced that she was donating all  of the land to the city of Waco. Mrs. Cameron revealed that she had purchased the land with Lawson as a liaison with the intention of donating it as a park in memory of her late husband. The gift came attached with a $5,000 gift for park development, as well as stipulations to preserve the name and funding for the park, and to prohibit commercial enterprise within its borders. The park was officially dedicated on May 27, 1910, with a large ceremony attended by nearly 15,000 people. Baylor University President Samuel Palmer Brooks served as the master of ceremonies for the dedication.

After the establishment of the park, the Cameron family continued to support its expansion and development, with gifts of land made in 1917 and 1920 that extended the park from the original site at Proctor Springs along the Brazos and Bosque all the way to Lover's Leap, a popular cliff formation. These gifts more than doubled the size of the park, and left it at the size it is today. During the Great Depression, federal workers affiliated with New Deal programs constructed trails, water drains, and retaining walls to improve the park. From this point, up until the mid-1960s, the park enjoyed significant popularity among Wacoans. In that decade, however, a controversy developed over plans to construct a bridge across the Brazos at Herring Avenue that would link East Waco more directly with the park. A combination of factors, including animosity towards the new park entrance, greater vehicular traffic, and racial factors stemming from the demographic makeup of East Waco, led popularity of the park to steeply drop. As attendance dropped, the facilities in the park began to deteriorate, and criminal activity in the park began to increase.

Until the late 1980s, Cameron Park continued to fall into disrepair and disuse. At the end of that decade, however, a revitalization process began to restore the park's former beauty and popularity. Congressman W. R. Pogue made a donation of $100,000 towards a wildflower preserve in honor of his late mother, known as Miss Nellie's Pretty Place. A greater police presence, including mounted police, was established to patrol the park. The opening of the Cameron Park Zoo in 1993 and the expansion of trails throughout that decade helped bring Cameron Park back to popularity among the entire population of the Waco area.

Present day
Today, Cameron Park is one of the largest city parks in Texas, with over  of trails, a disc golf course, cross country running course, recreational courts and playgrounds, picnic areas, and the Cameron Park Zoo. It celebrated its centenary in 2010, and funds raised for that celebration will be funding a new limestone pavilion in the park, set to be completed in the summer of 2015.

DSI's purpose was to undertake R&D in magnetics technology for hard disk drives (HDDs). Over the years, DSI collaborated with companies such as Seagate, Connor, DEC, Toshiba, Hewlett-Packard and Western Digital.

On 1 June 2018, A*STAR announced its decision to redeploy DSI's renowned capabilities across the organisation in alignment with national research and innovation strategies, and that DSI would no longer function as an independent research unit in A*STAR. The organisation cited the impact of global trends on the data storage industry, resulting in consolidation and much of production happening outside Singapore.

Background
Turajlić was born in Belgrade, Serbia. Her mother is Srbijanka Turajlić, a pro-democracy activist. Turajlić studied film production at Belgrade University's Faculty of Dramatic Arts and political science at the London School of Economics. She then specialized in documentary film-making at the La Femis school in Paris and also obtained a PhD from the University of Westminster. She has worked as a researcher and production assistant for the BBC, Discovery Channel and Arte France. Additionally her experience includes working on the features The Brothers Bloom and Fade to Black as an assistant director, as well as on Apocalypto as a coordinator.

Turajlić has shared her experiences in documentary film making by lecturing at schools like Harvard University, Yale, the Sorbonne, and the University of Michigan. Her involvement in pedagogy includes teaching workshops at La Femis's Archidoc and the Balkan Documentary Center. She is also one of the founders of the Association of Documentary Filmmakers of Serbia. Turajlić helps produce Belgrade's ""Magnificent 7 Festival"", which showcases European documentaries.

Career

Cinema Komunisto
Produced in 2010, Cinema Komunisto examines how film making was used in Yugoslavia to shape the national identity. For Turajlić, the old communist movie studios symbolize both the beginning and the end of Yugoslavia. According to the director, she was prompted to document what she found at the Avala Film Studios because she ""...felt both amazement and anger at how they’ve been forgotten"". Built in the 1950s, the studios were one of the largest in the region, welcoming stars like Sophia Loren, Orson Welles, and Kirk Douglas. The president of Yugoslavia Josef Broz Tito was the driving force behind the local film industry. Turajlić gained access to Tito's private archives and interviewed his personal projectionist Leka Konstantinovic.

Cinema Komunisto won for Best Documentary at the Chicago International Film Festival and also received an award at FOCAL International. It was screened at the IDFA and at the Tribeca Film Festival, as well as having theatrical releases in Europe and North America.

The Other Side of Everything
The 2017 documentary, The Other Side of Everything, is about life in  war torn Serbia seen through the eyes of Srbijanka Turajlić, the director's peace activist mother. The subject is depicted as ""...a voice from yesterday which inspiringly refuses to be silenced. The country's recent and distant pasts are explored in the film. Permanently locked doors in the family's apartment refer to the absurdities of the old communist regime. Mila's great-grandfather, a wealthy politician, owned the apartment, which was sub-divided into smaller living quarters when the communists took power in the 1940s. Spied on by their new neighbors, the Turajlić family had to watch what they said and did at home. One of the ""new"" tenants, who lived in the subdivision for seven decades, died during filming, which resulted in the locked doors finally being opened.

Described as ""accessible, informative and wryly humorous..."", the film won the ""Best Feature-Length Documentary Award"" at the 2017 International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA). The documentary also received the prize for cultural diversity at the goEast film festival in Germany. Turajlić won for best director at the RiverRun International Film Festival in North Carolina.

The Other Side of Everything made its American premiere at the 2018 San Francisco International Film Festival.  Additionally it was presented at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and had a special screening in Montreal, Canada.  The film also represents the first HBO Europe coproduction with Serbia and was broadcast by the network in 2017. It is distributed by Icarus Films.

Tito’s Cameraman
Turajlić is currently working on her next documentary Tito’s Cameraman, which is composed of archival footage and interviews with Stevan Labudović, whose camera lens ""...recorded the birth of friendships that became the cornerstone of the Non-Aligned Movement."" Labudović regularly accompanied Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito during his international travels, documenting his visits with heads of state. To capture intimate moments with these world leaders, Labudović developed a technique using a 50mm lens, so that ""... the true nature of their personality could be revealed."" He had the opportunity to film Nehru, Queen Elizabeth II, Kim Il-sung, John F. Kennedy, Fidel Castro, among others.

Labudović shot news reels of exotic places that intrigued the Yugoslav public back home. He also recorded historical moments around the world that left an imprint, even years later. He became a national hero in Algeria for filming the country's liberation from France.  Born in 1926 in Berane, Stevan Labudović died in 2017 in Belgrade.

774,35983326,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort%20Sturgeon,Fort Sturgeon,"Fort Sturgeon (1776–1780) was the first trading post on the North Saskatchewan River. It was located about 4 miles west of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It and was also called Peter Pond Fort, Fort Pond, Fort la Prairie, Fort des Prairies, Lower Settlement and Fort Sturgeon River.

It was located on the north bank of the river just east of the mouth of the Sturgeon River (Saskatchewan) in the Aspen parkland country. To the south the grassland made a sort of ""bay"" into the forest. The woods to the north provided furs and the grassland to the south buffalo for food.

About 1775 a group of ""Pedlars"" (independent traders from Montreal) were downriver near the old Fort de la Corne.  Seeing the disadvantages of competition they formed a pool (in either 1775 or 1776) which by 1779 became the North West Company. Among them were Joseph Frobisher, Peter Pond, Peter Pangman, Nicholas Montour, William Bruce and Bartholomew Blondeau. In 1776 they moved upriver and built Fort Sturgeon. In the spring of 1778 Peter Pond set off with 5 canoes and 20 men, crossed the Methye Portage for the first time and wintered 30 miles south of Lake Athabasca. He returned next year with excellent furs, thereby opening up the Athabasca Country. In 1778 Pangman and Blondeau built a fort upstream near Silver Grove, Saskatchewan. In 1779 William Tomison of the HBC came up from Cumberland House and traded while the Pedlars were away. The post had more Indian troubles than most and there were several killings on both sides. In 1777 three men from Fort Sturgeon were killed allegedly for maltreatment of the Indians. In 1780 Indians burnt the fort to the ground when the traders were away.

The Pedlars returned and built a new post ""a little below the old House"". Morton guesses this was on the north bank opposite Betts Island 1.5 miles above the Prince Albert bridge. Peter Fidler passed by in 1792 and saw only ruins. In 1794 David Grant had a post on the Sturgeon River but did poorly because of NWC competition and inability to control his men. The XY Company (1798–1804) had a post two miles above the Sturgeon and both the HBC and NWC built competing post on the Sturgeon River itself. Innis mentions a ""Hudson's House"" built in 1776 above Prince Albert. The site is marked by a cairn at the end of Peter Pond Road off highway 3 four miles east of Prince Albert. The original site may have been washed away by the river.

777,6838326,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost%20Leg,Ghost Leg,"Ghost Leg (), known in Japan as  or in Korea as Sadaritagi (사다리타기, literally ""ladder climbing""), is a method of lottery designed to create random pairings between two sets of any number of things, as long as the number of elements in each set is the same.  This is often used to distribute things among people, where the number of things distributed is the same as the number of people.  For instance, chores or prizes could be assigned fairly and randomly this way.

It consists of vertical lines with horizontal lines connecting two adjacent vertical lines scattered randomly along their length; the horizontal lines are called ""legs"".  The number of vertical lines equals the number of people playing, and at the bottom of each line there is an item - a thing that will be paired with a player.  The general rule for playing this game is: choose a line on the top, and follow this line downwards.  When a horizontal line is encountered, follow it to get to another vertical line and continue downwards.  Repeat this procedure until reaching the end of the vertical line.  Then the player is given the thing written at the bottom of the line.

If the elements written above the Ghost Leg are treated as a sequence, and after the Ghost Leg is used, the same elements are written at the bottom, then the starting sequence has been transformed to another permutation.  Hence, Ghost Leg can be treated as a kind of permuting operator.

Process
As an example, consider assigning roles in a play to actors.

 To start with, the two sets are enumerated horizontally across a board. The actors' names would go on top, and the roles on the bottom.  Then, vertical lines are drawn connecting each actor with the role directly below it.
 The names of the actors and/or roles are then concealed so that people do not know which actor is on which line, or which role is on which line.
 Next, each actor adds a leg to the board. Each leg must connect two adjacent vertical lines, and must not touch any other horizontal line.
 Once this is done, a path is traced from top of each vertical line to the bottom. As you follow the line down, if you come across a leg, you must follow it to the adjacent vertical line on the left or right, then resume tracing down. You continue until you reach the bottom of a vertical line, and the top item you started from is now paired with the bottom item you ended on.

Another process involves creating the ladder beforehand, then concealing it.  Then people take turns choosing a path to start from at the top.  If no part of the amidakuji is concealed, then it is possible to fix the system so that you are guaranteed to get a certain pairing, thus defeating the idea of random chance.

Mathematics
Part of the appeal for this game is that, unlike random chance games like rock, paper, scissors, amidakuji will always create a 1:1 correspondence, and can handle arbitrary numbers of pairings.  It is guaranteed that two items at the top will never have the same corresponding item at the bottom, nor will any item on the bottom ever lack a corresponding item at the top.

It also works regardless of how many horizontal lines are added. Each person could add one, two, three, or any number of lines, and the 1:1 correspondence would remain.

One way of realizing how this works is to consider the analogy of coins in cups.  You have n coins in n cups, representing the items at the bottom of the amidakuji.  Then, each leg that is added represents swapping the position of two adjacent cups.  Thus, it is obvious that in the end there will still be n cups, and each cup will have one coin, regardless of how many swaps you perform.

Properties

Permutation
A Ghost Leg transforms an input sequence into an output sequence with the same number of elements with (possibly) different order.
Thus, it can be regarded a permutation of n symbols, where n is the number of vertical lines in the Ghost Leg., hence it can be represented by the corresponding permutation matrix.

Periodicity
Applying a Ghost Leg a finite number of times to an input sequence eventually generates an output sequence identical to the original input sequence.

I.e., if M is a matrix representing a particular Ghost Leg, then  for some finite n.

Reversibility
For any Ghost Leg with matrix representation M, there exists a Ghost Leg with representation M−1, such that

Odd/Even property of permutation
As each leg exchanges the two neighboring elements at its ends, the number of legs indicates the odd/even permutation property of the Ghost Leg. An odd number of legs represents an odd permutation, and an even number of legs gives an even permutation.

Infinite Ghost Legs with same permutation
It is possible to express every permutation as a Ghost Leg, but the expression is not one-to-one, i.e. a particular permutation does not correspond to a unique Ghost Leg. 
An infinite number of Ghost Legs represents the same permutation.

Prime
As there are an infinite number of Ghost Legs representing a particular permutation, it is obvious those Ghost Legs have a kind of equivalence.  Among those equivalent Ghost Legs, the one(ones) which have smallest number of legs are called Prime.

Bubble sort and highest simplicity
A Ghost Leg can be constructed arbitrarily, but such a Ghost Leg is not necessarily prime.  It can be proven that only those Ghost Legs constructed by bubble sort contains the fewest legs, and hence is prime.  This is equivalent to saying that bubble sort performs the minimum number of adjacent exchanges to sort a sequence.

Maximum number of legs of prime
For a permutation with n elements, the maximum number of neighbor exchanging = 

In the same way, the maximum number of legs in a prime with n tracks =

Bubblization
For an arbitrary Ghost Leg, it is possible to transform it into prime by a procedure called bubblization.
When bubblization operates, the following two identities are repeatedly applied in order to move and eliminate ""useless"" legs.
 ⇒ 
 ⇒ 

When the two identities cannot be applied any more, the ghost leg is proven to be exactly the same as the Ghost Leg constructed by bubble sort, thus bubblization can reduce Ghost Legs to primes.

Randomness
Since, as mentioned above, an odd number of legs produces an odd permutation and an even number of legs produces an even permutation, a given number of legs can produce a maximum of half the total possible permutations (less than half if the number of legs is small relative to the number of tracks, reaching half as the number of legs increases beyond a certain critical number).

If the legs are drawn randomly (for reasonable definitions of ""drawn randomly""), the evenness of the distribution of permutations increases with the number of legs. If the number of legs is small relative to number of tracks, the probabilities of different attainable permutations may vary greatly; for large numbers of legs the probabilities of different attainable permutations approach equality.

In popular culture 

The 1981 arcade game Amidar, programmed by Konami and published by Stern, uses the same lattice as a maze. The game took its name from Amidakuji. and most of the enemy movement conformed to the game's rules.

An early Sega Master System game called Psycho Fox uses the mechanics of an Amidakuji board as a means to bet a bag of coins on a chance at a prize at the top of the screen. Later Sega Genesis games based on the same game concept DecapAttack and its Japanese predecessor ""Magical Hat no Buttobi Tabo! Daibōken"" follow the same game mechanics, including the Amidakuji bonus levels. 

Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins features an Amidakuji-style bonus game that rewards the player with a power-up. New Super Mario Bros. and Wario: Master of Disguise feature an Amidakuji-style minigame in which the player uses the stylus to trace lines that will lead the character down the right path.

In Mario Party there is a mini game where one of the four players pours money into an Amidakuji made out of pipes. The goal is to try to choose the path leading to the character controlled by the player.

The BoSpider in Mega Man X and Maverick Hunter X descends onto the player via an Amidakuji path.

In Mega Man Zero 3, an Amidakuji-like mini game can be unlocked, requiring the player to guide five colored jewels to the right colored beaker.

In Super Monkey Ball 2, there is a level in the Advanced-Extra difficulty named ""Amida Lot"" (Advanced-EX 7) that features a floor resembling an Amidakuji board, which bumper travels around the way and may knock off the player if they happen to hit them. The goal only travels through one of the vertical lines and the player must reach the goal using the ghost legs while avoiding the bumpers to not fall out.

In Digimon World the player must travel through the Amida Forest, the Forest being a Amidakuji. Travelling the correct paths will eventually see them recruit Centarumon. Travelling the incorrect paths however will cause their Digimon damage (multiple times for each wrong path taken).

In WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!, the microgame ""Noodle Cup"" features Amidakuji-style gameplay.

Azalea Gym in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver was redesigned with an Amidakuji-based system of carts to cross.  The correct choices lead to the gym leader; the wrong ones lead to other trainers to fight.

Phantasy Star Online 2 uses the principle of Amidakuji for a randomly appearing bomb-defusing minigame. One must trace an Amidakuji path around each bomb to determine which button defuses it; incorrect selections knock players away for a few seconds, wasting time.

In the manga Liar Game (vol 17), an Amidakuji is used for determinate the rank of each participant to the penultimate stage of the game.

In the Japanese drama Don Quixote (episode 10), the character Shirota (Shota Matsuda) uses Amidakuji to help decide between candidate families for an adoption.

778,24620479,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics%20%28Aristotle%29,Economics (Aristotle),"The Economics (; ) is a work ascribed to Aristotle. Most modern scholars attribute it to a student of Aristotle or of his successor Theophrastus.

Introduction

The title of this work means ""household management"" and is derived from the Greek word, οἶκος, oikos, meaning ""house/household"". The term includes household finance as it is commonly known today and also defines the roles members of the household should have. In a broad sense the household is the beginning to economics as a whole. The natural, everyday activities of maintaining a house are essential to the beginnings of economy. From farming, cleaning, and cooking to hiring workers and guarding your property, the household can offer a model for a modern understanding of society. The two books that comprise this treatise explore the meaning of economics while showing that it has many different aspects.

Book I

Book I is broken down into six chapters that begin to define economics. The text starts by describing that economics and politics differ in two major ways, one, in the subjects with which they deal and two, the number of rulers involved. Like an owner of a house, there is only one ruling in an economy, while politics involves many rulers. The practitioners of both sciences are trying to make the best use of what they have in order to thrive.

A household is made up of a man and his property. Next, agriculture is the most natural form of good use for this property. The man should then find a wife. Children should come next because they will be able to take care of the household as the man grows old. These are called the subject matter of economics.

The duties of a wife are the next important topic. A wife should be treated respectfully by her husband, and she will help him by bearing children. A man has to be modest in sexual encounters with his wife and not dwell on sexual experiences. The wife should be nurturing and attend to the quiet aspects of the household. Her duties should center on maintaining the inner part of the house. The male should have instilled in him the belief he should never wrong his wife.

Next, the male involved in agriculture will need slaves to help him perform his duties. A slave should be given food for his work but be well disciplined. It is the duty of a man to oversee every aspect of his land, since it belongs to him. The quality of his land should never be left to others alone, because people do not naturally respect a man’s property as he does himself.  
As a true economist, a man needs to bring four qualities to the possession of wealth. Acquisition of land and guarding it are key. Wise usage results in produce that can be sold, thus increasing wealth.

Book I, then, is an introduction showing the basic formation of an economy. As every man performs these duties, a system will involve the buying and selling of properties and a flourishing lifestyle that supports a civilization. With these basic guidelines man can accumulate wealth and stimulate a form of economy.

Book II

The second book begins with the idea that there are four different types of economies. These are the Royal Economy, the Satrapic Economy, the Political Economy, and the Personal Economy. Whoever intends to participate successfully and supportively in an economy needs to know every characteristic of the part of economy he is involved in.

All the economies have one principle in common. No matter what is done, expenditures cannot exceed income. This is given as an important issue, fundamental to the notion of ‘economy.’ The rest of the second book relates historical events that created important ways in which economies began to function more efficiently and gives the origins of certain terms still in use today. The main topic is the flow of money through any economy and particular events.

Aristotle also established a difference between economics and chrematistics that would be foundational in medieval thought.  For Aristotle, the accumulation of money itself is an unnatural activity that dehumanizes those who practice it.

War, and more specifically overall protection of countries, gave rise to many forms of loans, debt, increased taxes, and complex investments. War demanded an increase of money to cover expenses. So, places like Athens needed either to borrow money from other places or be given men (mercenaries) through specific financial arrangements.

Other events like paying for sea exploration and schooling also increased different types of money exchange, further stimulating economies. In sum, the treatise provides a view of Fourth-century Greek economic practices from the macro levels all the way down to various micro levels. Observing these can still be relevant today.

The third book is only known from Latin versions of the original Greek and deals with the relationship between husband and wife.

781,322293,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambeth%20Palace,Lambeth Palace,"Lambeth Palace is the official London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is situated in north Lambeth, London, on the south bank of the River Thames,  south-east of the Palace of Westminster, which houses the Houses of Parliament, on the opposite bank.

History
While the original residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury was in his episcopal see, Canterbury, Kent, a site originally called the Manor of Lambeth or Lambeth House was acquired by the Diocese around AD 1200 and has since served as the Archbishop's London residence. The site  is bounded by Lambeth Palace Road to the west and Lambeth Road to the south, but unlike all surrounding land is excluded from the parish of North Lambeth. The garden park is listed and resembles Archbishop's Park, a neighbouring public park; however, it was a larger area with a notable orchard until the early 19th century. The former church in front of its entrance has been converted to the Garden Museum.  The south bank of the Thames along this reach, not part of historic London, developed slowly because the land was low and sodden: it was called Lambeth Marsh, as far downriver as the present Blackfriars Road. The name ""Lambeth"" embodies ""hithe"", a landing on the river: archbishops came and went by water, as did John Wycliff, who was tried here for heresy. In the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, the Palace was attacked.

The oldest remaining part of the palace is the Early English chapel. Lollards' Tower, which retains evidence of its use as a prison in the 17th century, dates from 1435 to 1440. The front is an early Tudor brick gatehouse built by Cardinal John Morton and completed in 1495. Cardinal Pole lay in state in the palace for 40 days after he died there in 1558. The fig tree in the palace courtyard is possibly grown from a slip taken from one of the White Marseille fig trees here for centuries (reputedly planted by Cardinal Pole). In 1786, there were three ancient figs, two ""nailed against the wall"" and still noted in 1826 as ""two uncommonly fine... traditionally reported to have been planted by Cardinal Pole, and fixed against that part of the palace believed to have been founded by him. They are of the white Marseilles sort, and still bear delicious fruit. ...On the south side of the building, in a small private garden, is another tree of the same kind and age."" By 1882, their place had been taken by several massive offshoots.  The notable orchard of the medieval period has somewhat given way to a mirroring public park adjoining and built-up roads of housing and offices. The palace gardens were listed grade II in October 1987.

The great hall was completely ransacked, including the building material, by Cromwellian troops during the English Civil War. After the Restoration, it was completely rebuilt by archbishop William Juxon in 1663 (dated) with a late Gothic hammerbeam roof.  The choice of a hammerbeam roof was evocative, as it reflected the High-Church Anglican continuity with the Old Faith (the King's (Charles II) brother was an avowed Catholic) and served as a visual statement that the Interregnum was over. As with some Gothic details on University buildings of the same date, it is debated among architectural historians whether this is ""Gothic survival"" or an early work of the ""Gothic Revival"". The diarist Samuel Pepys recognised it as ""a new old-fashioned hall"".

The building is listed in the highest category, Grade I, for its architecture – its front gatehouse with its tall, crenellated gatehouse resembles Hampton Court Palace's gatehouse which is also of the Tudor period, however Morton's Gatehouse was at its very start, in the 1490s, rather than in the same generation as Cardinal Wolsey's wider, similarly partially stone-dressed deep red brick façade. While this is the most public-facing bit, it is not the oldest at north-west corner, the Water Tower or Lollards' Tower mentioned above is made of Kentish Ragstone with ashlar quoins and a brick turret is much older.

Among the portraits of the archbishops in the Palace are works by Hans Holbein, Anthony van Dyck, William Hogarth and Sir Joshua Reynolds.

New construction was added to the building in 1834 by Edward Blore (1787–1879), who rebuilt much of Buckingham Palace later, in neo-Gothic style and it fronts a spacious quadrangle. The buildings form the home of the Archbishop, who is ex officio a member of the House of Lords and is regarded as the first among equals in the Anglican Communion.

Library

Within the palace precincts is Lambeth Palace Library, the official library of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the principal repository of records of the Church of England. It describes itself as ""the largest religious collection outside of the Vatican"".

The library was founded as a public library by Archbishop Richard Bancroft in 1610, and was historically located within the main Palace complex. A new purpose-built library and repository opened in 2021. This is located at the far end of the Palace gardens, with its entrance on Lambeth Palace Road, and was designed by Wright & Wright. In addition to the existing library collections, it houses the archival collections of various Church of England institutions formerly held at the Church of England Record Centre (opened 1989) in Bermondsey.

The library contains an extensive collection of material relating to ecclesiastical history, including the archives of the archbishops dating back to the 12th century, and those of other church bodies and of various Anglican missionary and charitable societies. Manuscripts include items dating back to the 9th century. The library also holds over 120,000 printed books. In 1996, when Sion College Library closed, Lambeth Palace Library acquired its important holdings of manuscripts, pamphlets, and pre-1850 printed books. 

Topics covered by the collections range from the history of art and architecture to colonial and Commonwealth history, and numerous aspects of English social, political and economic history. The library is also an important resource for local history and genealogy. For online catalogues, see External links below.

Highlights of the collection

Notable items in the collections include:
 Mac Durnan Gospels (late 9th/early 10th centuries)
 Minuscule 473 (11th century)
 Minuscule 559 (11th century)
 Lambeth Apocalypse (12th century)
 The Romanesque Lambeth Bible (12th century)
 Lambeth Homilies (c.1200)
 Book of Hours of King Richard III (mid 15th century)
 A Short English Chronicle (mid 15th century)
 A rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible (1450s)
 Lambeth Choirbook (16th century)
 Book of Howth (late 16th century)
 Archives of the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches (1711–1759)
 Archives of the Incorporated Church Building Society (1818–1982)

St Mary-at-Lambeth

Immediately outside the gatehouse stands the former parish church of St Mary-at-Lambeth. The tower dates from 1377 (repaired in 1834); while the body of the church was rebuilt in 1851 to the designs of Philip Hardwick. Older monuments were preserved, including the tombs of some of the gardeners and plantsmen John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name, and of Admiral William Bligh. St Mary's was deconsecrated in 1972, when the parish was absorbed into the surrounding parish of North Lambeth which has three active churches, the nearest being St Anselm's Church, Kennington Cross. The Museum of Garden History (now the Garden Museum) opened in the building in 1977, taking advantage of its Tradescant associations.

During the renovation works of 2016, a previously unknown crypt was discovered, containing 30 coffins. Amongst these were those of five Archbishops of Canterbury, including Richard Bancroft, Thomas Tenison, Matthew Hutton, Frederick Cornwallis, and John Moore, as well as that of John Bettesworth, Dean of the Arches.

Resident community

Lambeth Palace is home to the Community of Saint Anselm, an Anglican religious order that is under the patronage of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

782,390846,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha%27s%20Vineyard%20Sign%20Language,Martha's Vineyard Sign Language,"Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) was a village sign-language that was once widely used on the island of Martha's Vineyard from the early 18th century to 1952. It was used by both Deaf and hearing people in the community; consequently, deafness did not become a barrier to participation in public life. Deaf people who signed Martha's Vineyard Sign Language were extremely independent. They participated in society as typical citizens, although there were incidents of discrimination, and language barriers.

The language was able to thrive because of the unusually high percentage of Deaf islanders and because deafness was a recessive trait, which meant that almost anyone might have both Deaf and hearing siblings. In 1854, when the island's Deaf population peaked, an average of one person in 155 was Deaf, while the United States national average was one in about 5,730. In the town of Chilmark, which had the highest concentration of Deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was Deaf.

Sign language on the island declined when the population migrated to the mainland. There are no fluent signers of MVSL today. Katie West, the last Deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, died in 1952, though there were a few elderly residents still able to recall MVSL when researchers started examining the language in the 1980s. Linguists are working to save the language, but their task is difficult because they cannot experience MVSL firsthand.

Origins 
Hereditary deafness had appeared on Martha's Vineyard by 1714. The ancestry of most of the Deaf population of Martha's Vineyard can be traced to a forested area in the south of England known as the Weald—specifically the part of the Weald in the county of Kent. Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) may be descended from a hypothesized sign language of that area in the 16th century, now referred to as Old Kent Sign Language. Families from a Puritan community in the Kentish Weald emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in British America in the early 17th century, and many of their descendants later settled on Martha's Vineyard. The first Deaf person known to have settled there was Jonathan Lambert, a carpenter and farmer, who moved there with his wife—who was not Deaf—in 1694. By 1710, the migration had virtually ceased, and the endogamous community that was created contained a high incidence of hereditary deafness that persisted for over 200 years.

In the town of Chilmark, which had the highest concentration of Deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was Deaf. By the 18th century there was a distinct Chilmark Sign Language. In the 19th century, this was influenced by French Sign Language, and evolved into MVSL in the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 18th to the early 20th century, virtually everybody on Martha's Vineyard possessed some degree of fluency in the language.

Deaf migration to the mainland 
In the early 19th century, a new educational philosophy began to emerge on the mainland, and the country's first school for the Deaf opened in 1817 in Hartford, Connecticut (now called the American School for the Deaf). Many of the Deaf children of Martha's Vineyard enrolled there, taking their sign language with them. The language of the teachers was French Sign Language, and many of the other Deaf students used their own home-sign systems. This school became known as the birthplace of the Deaf community in the United States, and the different sign systems used there, including MVSL, merged to become American Sign Language or ASL—now one of the largest community languages in the country.

As more Deaf people remained on the mainland, and others who returned brought with them Deaf spouses they met there (whose hearing loss may not have been due to the same hereditary cause), the line of hereditary deafness began to diminish. At the outset of the 20th century, the previously isolated community of fishers and farmers began to see an influx of tourists that would become a mainstay in the island's economy. Jobs in tourism were not as Deaf-friendly as fishing and farming had been, and as intermarriage and migration joined the people of Martha's Vineyard to the mainland, the island community grew to resemble the wider community there more and more.

The last Deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, Katie West, died in 1952. A few elderly residents were able to recall MVSL as recently as the 1980s when research into the language began. Indeed, when Oliver Sacks subsequently visited the island after reading a book on the subject, he noted that a group of elderly islanders talking together dropped briefly into sign language then back into speech.

Life as a Deaf person on Martha's Vineyard 

Although the people who were dependent on MVSL were different, they still did the same activities as the typical Martha's Vineyard resident would. Deaf people would work both complex and simple jobs, attend island events, and participate within the community. In contrast to some other Deaf communities around the world, they were treated as typical people. Deaf people living in rural Mexico have a similar community, but few hearing people live there permanently. Other Deaf communities are often isolated from the hearing population; the Martha's Vineyard Deaf community of that period is exceptional in its integration into the general population.

Deaf MVSL users were not excluded by the rest of society at Martha's Vineyard, but they certainly faced challenges due to their deafness. Marriage between a Deaf person and a hearing person was extremely difficult to maintain, even though both could use MVSL. For this reason, the Deaf usually married the Deaf, raising the degree of inbreeding even beyond that of the general population of Martha's Vineyard. These Deaf-Deaf marriages contributed to the increase of the Deaf population within this community. The MVSL users often associated closely, helping and working with each other to overcome other issues caused by deafness. They entertained at community events, teaching hearing youngsters more MVSL. The sign language was spoken and taught to hearing children as early as their first years, in order to communicate with the many Deaf people they would encounter in school. Lip movement, hand gestures, mannerisms, and facial expressions were all studied. There were even separate schools specifically for learning MVSL. Hearing people sometimes signed even when there were no Deaf people present. For example, children signed behind a schoolteacher's back, adults signed to one another during church sermons, farmers signed to their children across a wide field, and fishermen signed to each other from their boats across the water where the spoken word would not carry.

Decline 
Martha's Vineyard Sign Language declined after the opening of the American School for the Deaf. Although students from Martha's Vineyard influenced the creation of American Sign Language with contributions from MVSL when they returned home, they brought ASL usage back with them, and MVSL faded. Additionally, as transportation became easier in the 19th century, the influx of hearing people meant that more genetic diversity was introduced, and hereditary deafness was no longer commonplace. The last person in the line of hereditary deafness of Martha's Vineyard was Katie West, who died in 1952. Following her death, Oliver Sacks noted in the 1980s that some elderly hearing residents of the island could remember a few signs, but the language truly died out after this point.

Resurgence of Sign Language on Martha's Vineyard 
In recent years there has been a push to reintroduce American sign language into the Island's culture. Martha's Vineyard Resident, Lynn Thorp, began her mission to revive ASL in the early 2000s with the ultimate goal of reinstating ASL as a second language. After studying the language through references such as Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language by Ellen Groce, and a series of 1989 teachings called “Interax,” Thorp began meeting with fellow Vineyard residents every week to practice sign language together. About a decade later, Thorp began teaching classes regularly at local community centers. Recently, the Edgartown Elementary School has adopted ASL into their regular curriculum, and other Martha's Vineyard Public Schools are soon to follow.

In popular culture 
Show Me a Sign by Ann Clare LeZotte is a middle grade novel about the thriving deaf community living on Martha's Vineyard in the early part of the 19th century. In the novel deaf and hearing characters successfully use Martha's Vineyard Sign Language to communicate with each other.

785,58229969,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsui%20Hachir%C5%8Demon,Mitsui Hachirōemon,"is the inherited name given to the first son born to , or the leading branch of the extended Mitsui family. It was  who started the naming ritual that a male heir would be called Hachirōemon when they decide the next leader of family business that Mitsui was known for. For those sons of Takatoshi, each  bloodline had a nickname: the first son Takahira held the Kita branch, the second son Takatomi the , and the third son Takaharu the  .

When the first son of Kita branch be too young to inherit the position from his father, one of his uncles or male cousins would be selected to fill in for a limited period of time, but they did not count him as a Hachirōemon. The extended family decided to expel  who had consumed family fortune by indulging in antiquity as hobby, thus Takayoshi's younger brother Takahisa was acted as Hachirōemon until Takakiyo, his nephew, was old enough.

Mitsui people who inherited the name Hachirōemon the financer:
 — 
 Kita branch: Takatoshi's first son (1)  — (3)  — (4)  — (5)  — (6)  — (7)  — (8)  — (9)  — (10)  — (11) , the last Hachirōemon the financer — (11) , an architect.
 Isarago branch: Takatoshi's second son (2) .
 Shimmachi branch: Takatoshi's third son  — (3´)  — (4´) .

1st - Takahira 
 was the first of the Mitsui head family, or the Kita branch.  As the eldest son of Mitsui Takatoshi and the original Kita branch, Takahira's younger brothers and their family would support Kita branch by having their sons adopted to. Mitsui family business was sustained as cousins and uncles worked as an interim head of the company, and both Takakata and Takahisa were not called Mitsui Hachirōemon.

2nd - Takatomi 
, the second son of Takatoshi, was the second head of the Mitsui family. His descendants headed the Isarago branch.

3rd - Takafusa 
 was the third head of the Mitsui family. He was the son of Takahira.

Takakata 
 was the son of Takaharu, the third son of Takatoshi and the first head of the Shinmachi branch.  Although not counted as such, when Takafusa retired as the third head in 1734, his successor Takayoshi was still young, so Takakata acted as Hachirōemon.

4th - Takayoshi 
 was the fourth head of the Mitsui family.  His childhood name was . In 1733, he was appointed , and inherited the Kita branch while his father's Takafusa became a Buddhist monk the following year. Renamed himself  in 1736, succeeded into the Kyoto money order business under the title of  in 1738, and in 1741, following the death of his uncle Takakata, Takayoshi succeeded as Hachirōemon.  However, as Takayoshi incurred a large amount of debt from  by spending too much on personal art collection as well as making huge donations to Saikyōji, his title of Hachirōemon was passed to Takafusa in 1747 through the intentions of his younger brother Takahisa, who was the head of the Shinmachi representing the interest of the extended Mitsuis at the time.  In 1750, Takayoshi handed over the Kita branch to his second son Takakiyo, but the squandering was not settled, so in August 1756, Mitsuis negotiated with Takayoshi and made an agreement that they paid him 1200 kan retirement pension, and Takayoshi agreed to withdraw from Mitui's financial business. Nonetheless, however, it was discovered that Takayoshi secretly borrowed money from Ōmotokata, and in the same year on 13 November, his successor, Takakiyo (then Shinpachi), decided to disown him offially: an application form was filed to the city financial officials on the 27th of the same month, in which Takakiyo signed the consent of 87 businessmen and employees that his uncle Takahisa would acted as Hachirōemon.

Takahisa 
, the son of Takafusa, succeeded as the third head of the Shinmachi branch as the adopted son of Takakata.  Although not counted as such, when his older brother, the fourth head, had his title as Hachirōemon revoked in 1747, Takahisa acted as Hachirōemon.

5th - Takakiyo 
 was the fifth head of the Mitsui family.  He was the second son of Takayoshi.

6th - Takasuke 
 was the sixth head of the Mitsui family.  He was the eldest son of Takakiyo.

7th - Takanari 
 was the seventh head of the Mitsui family.  He was the eldest son of Takasuke.

8th - Takayoshi 

 was a Japanese businessman during the Bakumatsu and the early Meiji period.  He was the eighth head of the Mitsui family.

During the Bakumatsu reformation, Takayoshi was able to move between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Imperial court, and helped establish the foundation of the Mitsui zaibatsu.  In 1859, he served as a money purveyor for the places of the Gaikoku bugyō, and after the Meiji Restoration, he worked on several aspects of the banking administration of the government.  He established the  and the Mitsui Bank.  He was also responsible for the foundation of Mitsui & Co.

9th - Takaaki 
 was the ninth head of the Mitsui family.

10th - Takamine 

 was the tenth head of the Mitsui family.  Known as a hobbyist, he built a mansion in Tokyo, the , in 1906.  In the area of approximately 13,500 tsubo (44,631 m2), the Noh stage, the garden, and the tennis court among others were established, and Jo-an, which would later be a National Treasure, was relocated there.

In 1908 Mitsui Takamine allied with a visiting U.S. business delegation to assist in resolving The Panic of 1907 and the unstable Stock Market in the United States.

In 1922, Takamine invited the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, at the request of the Imperial Household Agency, and hosted a reception of the crown prince with a dinner party, a Noh viewing, etc.  In 1933, as Takamine retired, he handed down the mansion at Imaichō to the eleventh head, Takakimi, but the mansion was destroyed by fire in the bombing of Tokyo in 1945.

Takakimi 
Baron  was the eleventh head of the Mitsui family.

After losing control of Mitsui companies after the dissolution of the zaibatsu following World War II, he ran Wakabakai Kindergarten, a kindergarten that was created by his father Takamine during his lifetime.  Also, Takakimi's residence, the  (built in 1952), was relocated from Nishi-Azabu, Minato, Tokyo to the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo in 1996, and is now open to the public.  His wife  was the daughter of Matsudaira Yasukata, the 18th head of the Echizen-Matsudaira clan who ruled the Fukui Domain.

He was a car enthusiast; before World War II, he owned more than 10 luxury cars made by European companies such as Bentley, Hispano-Suiza, Bugatti and Lancia.  Even into the 1990s, he drove his own Bentley T models.

Hisanori 
 is the twelfth and current head of the Mitsui family.  He works as an architect.

786,1933947,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama%20FC,Yokohama FC,"is a Japanese professional football club based in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, part of the Greater Tokyo Area. The club currently plays in the J2 League, which is the second tier of football in the country. The club was formed by fans of Yokohama Flügels as a protest against Flügels' merger with Yokohama Marinos in 1999, becoming the first supporter-owned professional sports team in Japan.

Since gaining J.League membership in 2001, Yokohama FC spent a long time in the second tier of the Japanese football league system. The club gained promotion to J.League Division 1 for 2007 season, as champions of J.League Division 2 in 2006, but were immediately relegated the following season. After twelve years in the J2 League, they returned to the top flight in the 2020 season, earning promotion the previous year.

History

Yokohama FC was formed in 1999 following the merger of Yokohama's two J.League clubs, the Yokohama Flügels and the Yokohama F. Marinos. Flügels supporters felt that their club had essentially been dissolved rather than merged with, so rejected the suggestion that they should start supporting Marinos – who had been their crosstown rivals. Instead, with money raised through donations from the general public and an affiliation with talent management company IMG, the former Flügels supporters founded the Yokohama Fulie Sports Club. Following the socio model used by FC Barcelona, the Fulie Sports Club created Yokohama FC, the first professional sports team in Japan owned and operated by its supporters.

For its first season in 1999, Yokohama FC hired former German national team and World Cup star Pierre Littbarski to be the manager and Yasuhiko Okudera, the first Japanese footballer to play professionally in Europe, to be the chairman. The club attempted to gain entry directly into the professional J.League, but the Japan Football Association only permitted entry to the amateur Japan Football League (JFL), at the time the third level of the Japanese football league system, and ruled that the club would not be eligible for promotion into J.League Division 2 at the end of its first season. So, despite finishing as JFL champion in 1999, Yokohama FC finished as JFL champion again in 2000 before being promoted to J.League Division 2.

The club spent the next 6 seasons in J.League Division 2 before finishing as champions in 2006 and gaining promotion to J.League Division 1. In 2007, just the ninth year of its existence, Yokohama FC played its first season in the top flight of Japanese football. After a poor season, the team were consigned to relegation with five games of the season still remaining. Despite their early relegation, Yokohama FC nevertheless decided the final outcome at the opposite end of the table; by defeating title contenders Urawa Red Diamonds on the last day of the season, Kashima Antlers secured the J.League Division 1 title.

In 2018, Yokohama FC narrowly missed out on automatic promotion by goal difference. The team made it to the J2 promotion final, losing to Tokyo Verdy on an stoppage time winner. In 2019, Yokohama finished second in J2 and gained automatic promotion to J1.

Fight for promotion
Although they had a dire season in 2005, ending 11th out of 12, they were in the top half of table throughout the 2006 season. On 26 November they finished in the top spot of the J2 League, and hence were finally promoted to the J. League 1.

This success story was so dramatic as to make people somewhat excited in Japan. Yokohama FC's financial situation was so poor that they didn't even own their own football ground or a club house. Players did everything themselves including carrying the goal posts and washing the jerseys.

One of their players, Kazuyoshi Miura, is 54 and a former player, Atsuhiro Miura (one of their main players before his 2010 retirement) was 36 when he last played for the club. These players once played for the Japan national team.

They lost all pre-season matches, even against college students, then also the first official match of the year. After this, they suddenly changed the player-manager to a freshman with little experience named Takuya Takagi, who was 38. At the beginning of the season few expected them to become champions.

As they could not adopt directly Flügels' white and blue strip given its similarity to that of Marinos, Yokohama FC decided to adopt an all-cyan kit, after NKK SC, a former company club which had closed in 1994. NKK SC was based in Kawasaki and played most matches at Todoroki Athletics Stadium, but used Mitsuzawa Stadium on days when the other Kawasaki clubs at the time (Verdy Kawasaki, Toshiba and Fujitsu) used it.

788,58570888,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chioma%20Opara,Chioma Opara,"Chioma Opara (born 23 May 1951 in Jos, Nigeria) is a Nigerian author and academic whose work primarily focuses on West African feminism. She is known for creating the theory of femalism and is one of the six most important African feminist theorists. Her work has been influential in studies of gender in Africa.

She is currently Professor of English and Comparative Literature on the Faculty of Humanities at Rivers State University in Port Harcout, Nigeria.

Education 
Opara received her B.A in French at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and went on to receive her diploma in French Studies at The University of Dakar and a certificate in French studies from the University of Tours in France. She received her Ph.D. in English at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria.

Opara has been an activist for humanities education in Nigeria. In a 2016 inaugural speech at Rivers State University, Opara stated that its Institute on Foundational Studies should be elevated to a full-fledged Faculty of Humanities. She argued that ""the elevation of the institute to a Faculty of Humanities  and Social Sciences would facilitate integrative possibilities. In a 2016 interview, she argued that the mastery of language, particularly the English language, is essential to bolster the academic prestige and achievement of higher education institutions in Nigeria: ""students should take the dictionary as their second bible."" At her university, Opara is dubbed ""the English women"" due to her expertise in the English language and literature.

Theories 
Opara's theoretical work focuses on innovating psychological and sociological feminist frameworks for African women and academics, particularly in analyzing literature. Opara centers the African female experience in the context of postcolonialism, globalization, economic disparity, and traditional African culture. She discusses how African women can subvert generations of sexism, entrenched in all of these systems in a specific context, and describes the appropriate tools for given contexts. Her work belongs to the school of burgeoning African feminist scholarship, which grew as a necessary response to the problem of white feminism and black feminism failing to address the experiences and perspectives of African women on the continent.

Femalism 
Opara describes her theory of femalism as a tangible ""praxis"" that ""foregrounds the body while applying psychoanalytical criticism in its negotiation of the gendered subjectivity deemed as culturally and socially constructed.""  In this theory, she describes the female body as a site of patriarchal abuse and violence on the African continent as the bearer of European colonialism and exploitation. In this way, she centers the female body, which she likens to Mother Nature, and draws a poignant link between the liberation of African women and African nations at large. She argues that: applying the theory of femalism, a variant of African feminism, the female body as well as mothering will constitute the systemic site of discourse and hermeneutics. Parallels will be drawn between the lacerated female body and the mutilated African nation jostled by wars, poverty, disease, colonialism, and postcoloniality. Simply put, the feminized African country evokes Mother Earth, Woman Earth--an abstract projection of the African female body. The scarred body not only aligns with the spiritual in the representation of the natural and the cosmic but also manifests the dents of a scrambled and ailing nation. In the mothering of texts, we shall limn some African writers, transcending to embrace the Satrean concept of freedom. The existent may,however,in spinning the web  of transcendence in a utopian precinct subordinate reproductive maternity to productive creative art.
In a lecture, Opara also described her theory:By virtue of its analysis of  living experiences focused on the body, femalism is as phenomenological as it is heuristic and composite. Drawing parallels between the politically scarred African nation and the socioculturally battered female body, femalism effects a nexus between the freedom of woman and that of the African continent. The female nurturing body is considered to be analogous to Mother Africa--an embodiment of Mother Nature. The Metropolitan manipulations of a jolted African nation in the course of its economic and historical trajectory are likened to the flagrant, patriarchal abuse of the female body and mind in the quest for a holistic existence.

Gynandrism 
Opara defines her theory of gynandrism (a term she uses differently than others) as the male empathy for women found in African literature. She writes that it provides ""African female subjects as well as female writers a robust leverage in the literary canon."" Furthermore, she states that ""the gynandrist's work proffers a site for implicitly or explicitly censuring sexist normative patterns on the one hand and extolling the merits of the female on the other.""

791,21438345,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design%20knowledge,Design knowledge,"There is a large body of knowledge that designers call upon and use during the design process to match the ever-increasing complexity of design problems. Design knowledge can be classified into two categories: product knowledge and design process knowledge.

Product Knowledge
Product knowledge has been fairly studied and a number of modeling techniques have been developed. Most of them are tailored to specific products or specific aspects of the design activities. For example, geometric modeling is used mainly for supporting detailed design, while knowledge modeling is working for supporting conceptual designs. Based on these techniques, a design repository project at NIST attempts to model three fundamental facets of an artifact representation: the physical layout of the artifact (form), an indication of the overall effect that the artifact creates (function), and a causal account of the operation of the artifact (behavior). The recent NIST research effort towards the development of the basic foundations of the next generation of CAD systems suggested a core representation for design information called the NIST core product model (CPM)  and a set of derived models defined as extensions of the CPM (e.g.). The NIST core product model has been developed to unify and integrate product or assembly information. The CPM
provides a base-level product model that is: not tied to any vendor software; open; non-proprietary; expandable; independent of any one product development process; capable of capturing the engineering context that is most commonly shared in product development activities. The core model focuses on artifact representation including function, form, behavior, material, physical and functional decompositions, and relationships among these concepts. The entity-relationship data model influences the model heavily; accordingly, it consists of two sets of classes, called object and relationship, equivalent to the UML class and association class, respectively.

Design Process Knowledge
Design process knowledge can be described in two levels: design activities and design rationale. The importance of representation for design rationale has been recognized but it is a more complex issue that extends beyond artifact function. The design structure matrix (DSM) has been used for modeling design process (activities) and some related research efforts have been conducted. For example, a web-based prototype system for modeling the product development process using a multi-tiered DSM is developed at MIT. However, few research endeavors have been found on design rationale.

Representation Scenarios
In terms of representation scenarios, design knowledge can also be categorized into off-line and on-line knowledge. Design process knowledge can be categorized into ontologies.

Off-line Knowledge
Offline Knowledge refers to existing knowledge representation, including design knowledge in handbook and design ‘‘know-how’’, etc.; the latter refers to the new design knowledge created in the course of design activities by designers themselves. For the off-line knowledge, there are two representation approaches. One is to highly abstract and categorize existing knowledge including experiences into a series of design principles, rationales and constraints. TRIZ is a good instance of this approach. The other is to represent a collection of design knowledge into a certain case for description. Case-based design is an example of this approach. The key issue is on the computerization of the
design knowledge representation. For instance, researchers at the Engineering Design Centre at Lancaster University, UK established a unique knowledge representation methodology and knowledge base vocabulary based on the theory of domains, design principles and computer modeling. They developed a software tool for engineering knowledge management. The tool provides an engineering system designer with the capability to search a knowledge base of past solutions, and other known technologies to explored viable alternatives for product design.

On-line Knowledge
On-line knowledge representation is capturing the dynamic design knowledge in a certain format for design re-use and archive. A few research efforts have been found in this area. Blessing  proposes the process-based support system (PROSUS) based on a model of the design process rather than the product. It uses a design matrix to represent the design process as a structured set of issues and activities. Together with the common product data model (CPDM), PROSUS supports the capture of all outputs of the design activity.

Ontologies
Ontologies are being used for product representation (e.g.). Research suggests that there is a need to provide computer support that will supply clear and complete design knowledge and also facilitate designer intervention and customization during the decision-making activities in the design process. For example, WebCADET  is a design support system that uses distributed Web-based AI tools. It uses the AI as text approach, where knowledge-based systems (KBSs) can be seen as a medium to facilitate the communication of design knowledge between designers. The system can provide support for designers when searching for design knowledge.

Krasna and Marx were good friends and Krasna says writing it took 10–15 years.

The original Broadway production was directed by Krasna, and starred Otto Kruger. Opening at the Fulton Theatre, it only ran for eight performances, from September 27 to October 2, 1948. The reviews were universally bad, with Brooks Atkinson at The New York Times writing that ""Mr. Marx has everyone's permission to throw down the pen and put back the moustachio any time he pleases."" However, film rights were sold to Warner Bros for $500,000.

The play toured as a summer stock production in the summers of 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1963, with co-author Groucho Marx playing the lead. Thanks to Marx's presence and an increasing number of Groucho-style jokes added to the script over time, the tours were well received.

Time for Elizabeth was adapted for TV in 1964, with Marx playing the lead.

The C217 model succeeded the C216 CL-Class and is the last version of the S-Class coupé. It is also the first Mercedes coupé to carry the S-Class name since the C126 model.

Development

Concept S-Class Coupé (2013) 
The Concept S-Class Coupé was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show to showcase the appearance of the upcoming S-Class coupé model. It features an new design compared to the previous CL-Class model, utilizing the brand's Sensual Purity design philosophy first developed for the W222 S-Class in 2009.

Production car unveiling 
The production version of the S-Class coupé was announced and unveiled in February 2014, with its first public showing at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2014. Mercedes showed the S500 model (known as the S550 in the United States market) at the Geneva show.

At the New York Auto Show in April 2014, Mercedes made the first public showing of the S 63 AMG 4MATIC model. The S 65 AMG model, which includes a V12 Bi-Turbo engine, was unveiled in July 2014.

Safety and technology 

It features the most advanced driver assistance and safety technology that was available in 2013, including Traffic Sign Assist with wrong-way driving warning function.

Suspension 
The C217 coupé continues to offer the AIRMATIC semi-active air suspension as standard. The C217 introduced an update to the hydraulic fully active Magic Body Control suspension (which debuted on the W222 sedan model), which allows the vehicle to lean up to 2.5 degrees into a turn, similar to the way a motorcycle leans into a turn. The leaning is intended to counter the effect of centrifugal force on the occupants and is available only on rear-wheel drive models.

Lighting 
Like the W222 sedan,  the C217 coupé includes full-LED lighting on the exterior (including full-LED headlamps with Intelligent Light System and Adaptive Highbeam Assist PLUS) and interior of the vehicle. Optional headlight features include 47 Swarovski crystals in each headlamp: 30 crystals for the turn signals and 17 for the daytime running lights.

Models

S 500/S 550 
The C217 S-Class coupé launched with the S 500 model, known as the S 550 in the United States market. The vehicle features a twin-turbocharged 4.7L engine paired with a 7-speed or a 9-speed (only for rear-wheel drive version) automatic transmission. In most markets, the S 500 is fitted to a rear-wheel drive drivetrain with optional 4MATIC all-wheel drive; in the US, 4MATIC is standard.

S 63 AMG 
Through the Mercedes-AMG sub-brand, the second S-Class coupé model launched is the S 63 AMG. Featuring a 5.5L turbocharged V8, the S 63 is the performance model V8 within the S-Class lineup. Like the S 500, the S 63 is offered with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, though with only all-wheel drive (without Magic Body Control) in the United States.

S 65 AMG 
The S 65 AMG is currently the top-of-the-line S-Class coupé model. It features a 6.0L turbocharged V12 Mercedes-Benz M279 engine paired with a 7G-Tronic automatic transmission. The V12 model is available only with rear-wheel drive (4MATIC not available).

Convertible 

The convertible version of the S-Class (codenamed A217), which was unveiled at the International Motor Show Germany in 2015, has many lightweight reinforcements such that its driving style is similar to that of the coupé version. Safety is maintained by a roll-over system, which is pyrotechnically actuated behind the rear passengers if required.
It is the first luxury 4-seater open Mercedes since 1971.

Maybach S 650 Cabriolet 
Based on the convertible version of the AMG S 65, the Maybach S 650 Cabriolet will be produced in a limited run of 300 units, each priced at $335,000, or €273,000 without tax.

Facelift 
In September 2017, the S-Class Coupé facelift was launched at the 2017 Frankfurt Auto Show. The outgoing S500/550 nameplate has been replaced by the S560. A whole new range of engines have been introduced. The new M177 4.0 V8 Biturbo replaces the old M157 5.5 V8 Biturbo in the AMG S63 4MATIC+. 4MATIC+ All Wheel Drive is now standard in the AMG S63 featuring drift mode. The S560 uses a detuned version of the same engine, dubbed the M176. A new Europe-only base model, the S450 4MATIC (replaces S400 4MATIC), uses the M256 I6 Turbo. A new 9G-Tronic transmission is now standard across the range, with the exception of the AMG S65, which still uses the 7G-Tronic.

Discontinuation 
The S-Class Coupé and Cabriolet have been discontinued after the 2021 model year.

797,17083455,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avvo,Avvo,"Avvo.com is an online marketplace for legal services, that provides lawyer referrals and access to a database of legal information consisting primarily of previously answered questions. Lawyer profiles may include client reviews, disciplinary actions, peer endorsements, and lawyer-submitted legal guides.

History
Avvo was founded in Seattle, Washington in 2006 by Mark Britton, a former legal counsel for Expedia, Inc.and Paul Bloom. Britton said he developed the idea while vacationing in Italy and was still receiving inquires from friends and colleagues seeking legal advice. Rich Barton, the founder of the Expedia, Inc. and real-estate database Zillow.com, was a key advisor during the initial ideation stages and still serves on the board of directors. Avvo was derived from “avvocato”, the Italian word for lawyer.

The company was initially financed with $13 million in venture capital from Benchmark Capital and Ignition Partners. Subsequently, Avvo raised $71.5 million in financing in 2015, which brings the company's total financing to $132 million.

In January 2018, Avvo entered a deal to be acquired by Internet Brands.

Business model
Avvo generates revenue by selling legal services, advertising, and other services primarily to lawyers. Avvo operates as a scraper site to generate its lawyer listing pages causing the District of Columbia Bar Association to specifically object to its business practices. An additional source of revenue for Avvo is through a $49.95/mo subscription service called ""Avvo Pro"" which allows lawyers to remove advertisements from their profile, including advertisements by competing lawyers which may appear on non-""Avvo Pro"" lawyer profiles.

Avvo also connects consumers directly with lawyers for telephone consultations and for a limited assortment of flat fee legal services. Service availability may vary by state.

Lawyer directory
According to the website, the directory provides comprehensive profiles, client reviews, peer endorsements, and its own proprietary rating for more than 97% of all licensed attorneys in the United States. Avvo lawyer profiles are aggregated from public records provided by state bars and additional attorney licensing entities. Avvo will not delete any lawyer's profile, and has been criticized for including profiles of deceased lawyers.

As of 2010, Avvo's directory includes ratings of lawyers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Bar Association released its position about Avvo:

The Bar has not entered into any agreement with Avvo; instead, Avvo has obtained Bar member information directly from the Bar’s Web site, in violation of our restrictions on use, and used that information for its own commercial purposes. The Bar has asked Avvo to remove all improperly acquired D.C. Bar member information from its Web site, cease all attempts to acquire such information from the Bar’s Web site, and cease using improperly acquired information for any commercial purpose.

Lawyer ratings
Avvo presents ratings of lawyers that are included in its directory, based upon a proprietary algorithm. Avvo cautions users that a rating ""is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer's quality, competency, or character. Nor is the Avvo Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved.""

Avvo's rating system has been criticized and has inspired some controversy. When sued by lawyers who object to the ratings, Avvo has successfully defended against the lawsuits by asserting that the ratings constitute a constitutionally protected opinion.

Browne v. Avvo
A lawsuit was filed on June 14, 2007, nine days after Avvo's launch, by Seattle attorneys, John Henry Browne and Alan Wenokur. The suit alleged that Avvo's rating system made false claims of being factual and was therefore deceptive and libelous and violated the Washington Consumer Protection Act.
United States District Court Judge Robert Lasnik ruled that the rating system was only an opinion and was thus protected by the First Amendment right of free speech. The judge wrote, ""Neither the nature of the information provided nor the language used on the Web site would lead a reasonable person to believe that the ratings are a statement of actual fact.""

After the ruling, an editorial in The Wall Street Journal endorsed the website for providing ""at least some measure of transparency"" of the legal profession.

New Jersey 
The New Jersey State Bar Association sent an inquiry to the Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics asking if New Jersey attorneys may participate in certain online, non-lawyer, corporately owned services specifically naming Avvo and other online services. As a result of that inquiry, the Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics, Committee on Attorney Advertising, and Committee on the Unauthorized Practice of Law issued a joint opinion. The joint opinion stated that New Jersey attorneys may not participate in Avvo services as it is against the rule of professional conduct.

Doctor directory
The doctor directory launched on November 1, 2010. Avvo's health business was sold to HealthTap on November 29, 2012.

799,1952607,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernature%20%28Goldfrapp%20album%29,Supernature (Goldfrapp album),"Supernature is the third studio album by English electronic music duo Goldfrapp, released on 17 August 2005 by Mute Records. The album received generally favourable reviews, with most critics complimenting its blend of pop and electronic music. It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 52,976 copies, and has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Supernature has sold one million copies worldwide.

The album's lead single, ""Ooh La La"", reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the duo's highest-peaking single to date. The album spawned three further singles: ""Number 1"", ""Ride a White Horse"" and ""Fly Me Away"". In North America, where ""Number 1"" was promoted as the first single, the album was released on 7 March 2006 and reached number 138 on the charts. Supernature was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2007.

Recording and production

Supernature contains music in the same pop and electronic dance styles featured on Goldfrapp's previous studio album, Black Cherry (2003)—especially its singles ""Strict Machine"" and ""Twist""—although it focuses on subtle hooks instead of large choruses. Lead singer Alison Goldfrapp described the album's writing process as ""an electronic/glam cross between Berlin, New York and North-East Somerset"".

Goldfrapp and Will Gregory recorded the bulk of Supernature in late 2004 in the countryside near Bath, England—the same place they recorded Black Cherry. They had rented a small house and spent some months writing music; they later explained that the unpopulated location kept them from distractions and that the majority of the process was ""very basic"". Goldfrapp called their writing relationship a ""democracy"", playing off one another while in the recording studio. The lyrical content of the song ""Number 1"", which became the album's second single, is about the importance and meaning of relationships, even though they do not necessarily last.

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Goldfrapp explained that they had never intended to create pop music. However, the singles released from Black Cherry became successes across nightclubs in North America, and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Although this made the duo nervous, ""Ooh La La"" was the group's first song to feature the electric guitar. Before its composition, the duo avoided the use of the guitar because of the guitar's overly recognisable rhythm. Four-on-the-floor bass drums are also present on several of the album's tracks, and the piano ballad ""Let It Take You"" features evening-effects composed on a synthesiser. ""You Never Know"" begins with Alison Goldfrapp executing a synthesised voice, supported by both pads and synthesisers. Goldfrapp and Gregory have cited ""Satin Chic"" as their favourite song on Supernature.

Alison Goldfrapp named the Roland String synth as one of her favourite keyboards. ""Number 1"" features an old synth and a bass arrangement that the group began to use frequently after recording the song. Another Roland keyboard, the SH-09 monophonic synthesiser first produced in 1979, is another favourite; she played the duo's song ""Train"" (2003) on it and enjoys the sounds that it makes. Goldfrapp was also impressed by a Russian synth, enamored with its Russian-language writing.

Composition and music

""Ooh La La"", Supernatures opening track, inspired by T. Rex, was chosen as its lead single ""because it was up and in your face and it carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album"". It was the duo's first song to feature the electric guitar, and received positive reviews, often being noted as a highlight of the album. ""Ooh La La"" became Goldfrapp's most successful single on the UK Singles Chart to date when it peaked at number four, while topping the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States. The second track, ""Lovely 2 C U"", received mixed reviews from critics, with one reviewer stating that it was the ""worst offender of sounding by-numbers, its lazy glam affectations sounding all the worse amid a chorus striking only in its complete dullness"".

""Ride a White Horse"", the third single, was inspired by the disco era. Like previous singles from the album, the song was another top-20 single in the UK, where it peaked at number 15. The ballads ""You Never Know"" and ""Let It Take You"" have minimal background electronics, and were generally well received by critics, who drew comparisons to Goldfrapp's debut album Felt Mountain. Goldfrapp's performance on ""You Never Know"" was described as ""chameleonic"" with odes to Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux. ""Fly Me Away"", another synth ballad, had an accompanying music video which featured Goldfrapp as an animated doll; the video, however, was never released. Serving as the fourth and final single from Supernature, the song was not heavily promoted and was less commercially successful than the other singles, peaking at number 26 on the UK chart. ""Slide In"", an electroclash song about sex, and ""Koko"" were compared to Gary Numan's early compositions.

""Satin Chic"" is a disco song with glam rock and cabaret influences, similar to early Elton John. Cited by Goldfrapp and Gregory as their favourite song on Supernature, it was remixed by The Flaming Lips, and issued as a limited-edition single on 4 September 2006. The 10th track, ""Time Out from the World"", features an orchestra and whispered vocals by Goldfrapp. Critics liked the song, writing that it was an ""exception to the prevailing style of Supernature"" due to its ""haunting, yet glamorous, atmospherics"". The album's closing track and second single ""Number 1"" is about the importance and meanings of relationships. The song, which is based around a synth and bass arrangement, reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart.

Release and artwork
The album was released in two versions: a single-disc version, which used Opendisc technology to offer extra contents via a website, and a double-disc version which included the album in surround sound on both discs. The first disc is a hybrid SACD with 5.1 multichannel SACD audio, stereo SACD audio and stereo CD audio. The second disc, a DVD-Video, contains the multichannel version of the album in DTS 96/24 as well as a documentary and music videos for ""Ooh La La"" and ""Number 1"".

The album cover, photographed by Ross Kirton, is a rear-view shot of Alison against a sparkly black backdrop, looking over her shoulder while covering her breast with her hand. The regular edition cover shows her from the waist up, whereas the US special edition shows the cover art in its entirety, with Alison wearing a long plume of peacock feathers and golden platform shoes. In late 2005, the album ranked number eight on the annual Best Art Vinyl poll.

Critical reception

Supernature received favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 27 reviews. Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian  said that the album was ""a brash, beautiful celebration of love and dancing"". In a review for PopMatters, Adrien Begrand said that ""[a]lthough Supernature lacks the imagination of Felt Mountain and the saucy brilliance of Black Cherry, it doesn't pander to the pop crowd."" Lauren Gitlin of Rolling Stone said the album was ""[t]oxic and delicious"" and that ""Supernature will make you do bad things—and like it."" However, Pitchfork reviewer Nitsuh Abebe was less impressed, and wrote that the album's songs ""keep feeling like exercises: too thick and melodic to work like dance music, but with melodies that refuse to stick as satisfyingly as pop."" Michael Hubbard of musicOMH wrote a review for every song on Supernature, and although he felt that it was a ""curious, rather than classic, record"", he criticised it for ""fading out early on, with poor, low quality songs at the end which leave the listener feeling cheated"". AllMusic critic Heather Phares called Supernature ""Goldfrapp's most accessible album"" and named ""Ooh La La"" as its best song.

In a review for Canadian-based website Jam!, Andrew Carver praised the different sounds on Supernature, which range from ""a blend of future noise"" to ""crushed velvet corruption""; he described the album as ""one sharp recording"". Jessica Suarez of Spin magazine compared ""Ooh La La"" to Black Cherry'''s ""Strict Machine"", saying that ""Ooh La La"" sounds ""so simplistic that [its] minimalist repetition occasionally teeters over into redundancy"". She praised ""Ride a White Horse"" and ""Fly Me Away"" for featuring Alison Goldfrapp's ""velvet-soft vocals, which stay that way even when heavily processed"". A less favourable reception came from Stylus Magazine reviewer Edward Oculicz, who stated ""Supernature is not a great album"" and called several of its tracks too ""dull"".Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album at number 32 on its list of The Top 50 Albums of 2006. In January 2008, the album was included on The Daily Telegraphs list of the 120 essential pop albums. At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Goldfrapp received nominations for Best Electronic/Dance Album and Best Dance Recording for ""Ooh La La"".

Commercial performance
Supernature debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number two (blocked from the top position by James Blunt's Back to Bedlam), selling 52,976 copies in its first week. The album was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 13 January 2006. By 20 December 2010, the album had sold 500,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The album attained moderate success across Europe, reaching the top 10 in Ireland, the top 20 in Belgium, the top 30 in Germany and Switzerland, and the top 40 in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway. In Oceania, it peaked at number 23 in Australia and number 35 in New Zealand.

Supernature became Goldfrapp's first album to appear on the Billboard 200 in the United States, where it peaked at number 138. It reached number three on the Top Heatseekers chart and number five on the Top Electronic Albums chart. The album had sold 49,000 copies in the US as of August 2006. Supernature was also the duo's first release in Canada, reaching number 88 on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album had sold one million copies worldwide as of February 2008.

803,12237223,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuma-class%20cruiser,Kuma-class cruiser,"The  were a class of five light cruisers built for and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). The Kuma-class cruisers proved useful in combat operations ranging from the Aleutian Islands to the Indian Ocean throughout World War II.

The Kuma-class was followed by the very similar .

Background
Despite the success of the  high speed light cruiser design, the Imperial Japanese Navy realized that they would be outgunned by the larger US Navy  and the Dutch Java-class of light cruisers then under development. In addition, the Tenryū-class vessels, with a maximum speed of , were unable to keep up with the newer Japanese destroyers, such as the , which had a design speed of . At the end of 1917, plans for an additional six Tenryū-class vessels, plus three new-design 7200 ton-class scout cruisers were shelved, in place of an intermediate 5,500 ton-class vessel which could be used as both a long-range, high speed reconnaissance ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer or submarine flotillas.

With the development of the long range oxygen-propelled Type 93 ""Long Lance"" torpedoes in the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff drafted plans to create a special ""Night Battle Force"" of torpedo cruisers. The idea was based on Japan's success in the naval Battle of Port Arthur in the Russo-Japanese War. As the new Type 93 torpedoes had a range longer than that of contemporary battleships' main battery, the concept was to have a high speed strike force attack an enemy fleet at night with a massive and overwhelming barrage of torpedoes. Major surface combatants would follow up at dawn to finish off the wounded enemy.

Ōi and Kitakami were subsequently modified with ten quadruple mount torpedo launchers (a total of 40 tubes), arranged in two broadside rows of five, i.e. 20 per side. The ships were assigned to the CruDiv 9 of the IJN 1st Fleet. However, the rapid development of naval aviation and submarine warfare in the 1930s quickly made this plan obsolete. In January 1942, Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Matome Ugaki expressed strong disapproval of the newly remodeled torpedo cruisers and urged a revision to the Navy's tactics. While the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff debated the issue, Ōi and Kitakami were converted to high speed transports, with , and Kitakami was subsequently converted into a carrier for kaiten suicide torpedoes.

Design
The Kuma-class hull design was based on a 5,500 ton nominal displacement, with a high freeboard and light bridge structure, behind which was a tripod mast with the fire control platform and two searchlights. The design proved so versatile that it became the standard upon which all future light cruisers in the Japanese navy would be based.

The propulsion system for the Kuma class was based on four axial deceleration turbines with 12 boilers, providing . Ten boilers were designed to burn heavy oil, and the remaining two burned a mixture of coal and oil. With improvements in geared-turbine engine technology, the Kuma-class vessels were capable of the high speed of , and a range of  at . The silhouette of the Kuma class was discernible by its three smoke stacks, with the stacks flaring out in a trumpet shape.

The number of 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns was increased from four on the Tenryū class to seven on the Kuma class, centerline mounted in individual gun turrets, (two fore, three after and one on either side of the bridge). The positioning meant that only six of the guns could be brought to bear in a broadside. As with the Tenryū class, the Kuma class remained highly deficient in anti-aircraft protection, with only two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns and two 6.5 mm machine guns. Provision was made for 48 naval mines. The two triple torpedo launchers on the Tenryū class was changed to four double launchers, placed in pairs so that four torpedoes could be fired on each side. Eight reloads were also provided.

Kiso was unique in that it had both a forward and aft flat surfaced superstructure, with a rotating floatplane take-off platform located aft. The platform appears to have never been used, and was removed in 1922, but her superstructure retained the shape of the hangar.

In service modifications
From 1931-1932, provision was made for a catapult to launch one floatplane (typically a Kawanishi E7K1 ""Alf"" floatplane ) for scouting purposes on Kuma and Tama. The catapult was situated aft, in between the No.5 and No.6 turrets.

From 1933-1934, the ships were renovated with a modified superstructure, replacing the canvas sides of the bridge with steel plate, and building a rangefinder tower behind the bridge was with either an  or  rangefinder. Kiso was also given anti-rain caps on her two forward stacks, which gave her a unique appearance.

By 1941, the 8-cm Type 3 guns were replaced by a twin-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns, and the 6.5 mm machine guns were upgraded to 13.2 mm. All of the ships in the Kuma class were progressively upgraded during the Pacific War. The modifications varied from vessel to vessel, but consisted of removing the aircraft catapult and at least one of the main 140-mm turrets, and replacing with twin or triple-mount Type 96 25-mm anti-aircraft guns. From 1943-1944, Kiso and Tama were given a twin turret with 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns. Kiso, Tama and Kitakami were the only in the class to receive radar.

In August 1941 Ōi,  Kitakami and Kiso were to undergo a conversion to torpedo cruisers to form a special torpedo attack squadron, but not enough Type 92 quadruple torpedo mounts were available so only the first two were converted, both ships three aft turrets were replaced by ten quadruple torpedo mounts, five per side, with a total of 40 torpedoes. In August 1942, they were modified into fast transports, with all of the torpedo tubes removed and replaced by Daihatsu class landing craft, with depth charge racks and two Type 96 triple-mount anti-aircraft guns.

After Kitakami was damaged in 1944, she was converted into a kaiten carrier, with all of her armament removed, and replaced by two Type 89 single gun turrets (fore and aft), a total of 67 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns(12 triple, 31 single), two depth charge racks and eight Model 1 Kaiten. Removal of the aft turbine engines reduced her speed to 23 knots.

Ships in class
Five vessels were built in the Kuma class. Only one (Kitakami) survived the Pacific War.

Ordered in 1917 to the Sasebo Navy Yard, launched 14 July 1919, and completed 31 August 1920, Kuma was active in screening the landings of Japanese troops in the Philippines in the early months of World War II, and remained stationed there for local defense. Later assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet in the Netherlands East Indies, she was refit at Singapore from October–November 1943. She was torpedoed by the submarine  off the west coast of Malaya on 10 March 1944.

Ordered in 1917 to Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, launched 10 February 1920, and completed 29 January 1921, Camouflaged in Arctic colors, Tama participated in the Aleutian Islands Campaign and the Battle of the Komandorski Islands and spent most of the early part of World War II in northern waters. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to Rabaul and other locations in the Solomon Islands. After refit in Japan in late 1943, she remained in Japanese home waters until reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy’s all-out final defense of the Philippines in October 1944. She was at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where she was damaged by USN aircraft and was torpedoed by USS Jallao  northeast of the Philippines on 25 October 1944 while attempting to return to Okinawa.

Ordered in 1917 to the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, launched 3 July 1920, and completed 15 April 1921, Kitakami was converted into a torpedo cruiser under a short-lived Imperial Japanese Navy program, which was abandoned at the eve of World War II. She subsequently participated in Battle of Midway as part of the Aleutian screening force. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to Rabaul and other locations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. From March 1943, she was assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet for escort and transport duties. After taking severe damage in a torpedo attack by the submarine  on 27 January 1944, she returned to Japan for conversion to carrier for Kaiten human torpedoes, but never served in this capacity due to lack of fuel. She survived the end of the war, and was used as a tender for repatriation vessels after the war. She was scrapped from 10 August 1946 – 31 March 1947.

López was born in Era Alta, an independent small village closed to Murcia, the second son of Roque López Duarte y Juana López Máiquez. With only 17 yeard old he went to Murcia to become an apprenticed to the Italian origin baroque sculptor Francisco Salzillo of who became his main disciple.

Only five months after working with him, Salzillo admired his student's work so much that in his will (made in 1764, although he died in 1783) he cited him as heir of his own work tools. With Salzillo, López learned from 1764 to 1783 the keys to baroque sculptures and biblical knowledge; in 1772 he is considered 'master'. To the style of Salzillo, López added a more realistic style and, as a result of that, greater expressiveness of his works. His technique of the ""round lump"" stands out. He is considered one of the last rococo sculptors before neoclassicism

According to his notebook, found in his study when he López died (Libro de la Verdad), throughout his career he created 466 sculptures, almost all of them religious, receiving commissions from many cities, towns and villages in southeastern Spain, mainly in Murcia, Albacete, Ciudad Real, Toledo and Madrid. His sculptures decorated churches, convents and private residence. He had two children: José and María.

Some of his masterpieces are the Capture of Christ (Tobarra), Our Father Jesus Nazarene (Murcia, Lorca, Alatoz and Alhama de Murcia), Christ Risen (Lorca), Our Lady of the Incarnation (La Raya), Our Lady of Los Remedios (Torreagüera), Our Lady del Rosario (Sucina), Our Lady of Sorrows (Murcia, Águilas and Beniaján), Saint Joseph with the Child (Murcia, Totana and Lorca), Saint Michael (Huercal-Overa), Saint John Evangelist (Murcia and Alhuazas), Saint Cecilia (Murcia), Saint Paul Hermit (Murcia), Saint Peter of Alcántara (Murcia) and The Samaritan (Murcia).

After the pain of losing his wife Lucía Hernández Martínez, died in 1807 in Murcia, López died in Mula from yellow fever, which murdered also his only son José López and his niece Lorenzo López.

In 2011, the bicentenary of his death, the Museo Salzillo in Murcia organized a major exhibition of his works entitled Roque López. La mirada del discípulo.

It is located at 1328 Northwest 3rd Avenue. On April 17, 1992, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

On June 17, 1906 at the corner of NW 2nd Avenue and 11th Terrace, a small group was called together for worship.

They initially called this congregation Second Baptist Church. The first pastor of this group was Rev. Bynom.

After a short time, a second pastor, Rev. N.B. Williams, was called to lead this new and growing congregation. 
During Rev. Williams' tenure, the membership moved to Jackson's Hall on 10th street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue. 
The members considered plans for a permanent location. After purchasing a lot at 12th Street and 3rd Avenue, construction began on a 50X48 foot frame building.

The congregation moved into this building on the third Sunday in February 1908. Rev. Williams served until the latter part of 1910.
 
In 1912, Rev. Jarius Wilkerson Drake cast his membership with the church. He assumed leadership of the church on the first Sunday in February. 
Rev. Drake maintained a loving and Christian attitude towards all members. The membership grew and increased tremendously. 
The initial church building was damaged and wrecked during storms in 1926 and 1928, but was remodeled. 
This building became too small under Rev. Drake's leadership, and the congregation purchased a larger site to accommodate the membership. 
The newly built church, completed in 1940, is located on the current site, which sits on 13th Street and 3rd Avenue. 
The church then became known as St. John Missionary Baptist Church. Rev. Drake served as pastor until his death in February 1951.
 
Succeeding Rev. Drake was Rev. Thedford Johnson, who was serving as Assistant Pastor. 
Under his pastorate, a two-story building at 1148 NW 3rd Avenue was built as a parsonage; 
the Fellowship Hall was built, the Children's Center (formerly known as the Tot Center) was established, 
an apartment unit was purchased, the sanctuary was air-conditioned, the pews were cushioned 
and a two-mirror loft in the main sanctuary was built. St. John also experienced national recognition with their Baptist Training Union (BTU). 
For three decades, St. John was noted as not only the largest and best in the Florida East Coast and the State, but was acclaimed as the ""National Model"" by then National President Dr. J. H. Jackson. Because of Rev. Johnson's interest in civic and political affairs, and his motivation of the congregation toward civic pride, the church continued to thrive. St. John hosted the National Baptist Convention four times: 1969, 1973, 1977 and 1982. Rev. Johnson also maintained a radio program from 1977 through 1980. The church revised its name to reflect the current standing, St. John Institutional Missionary Baptist Church. Rev. Johnson resigned in February 1985.

Rev. Henry Nevin became Interim Pastor in March 1985. During this time, Rev. Nevin introduced the idea of having a Community Development Corporation 
to assist in rehabilitating subsidized housing for the poor and building median income housing for the community. 
On January 9, 1986, Rev. Nevin was elected Senior Pastor of St. John. Rev. Nevin retired from his pastoral services on Sunday, June 1, 2008.

Rev. Dr. Charles Uptgrow Sr. assumed the position of Senior Minister in Charge, but due to health concerns, the position was then passed to Rev. Antonio Bolden, who was then the current Youth Minister. As the search for a pastor began, many candidates were interviewed.  In April 2010, Bishop James Dean Adams became Senior Pastor of St. John.

The building was designed by architects McKissack & McKissack in Moderne style.  It has also been known as New St. John Institutional Baptist Church.

816,20129636,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siyuan%20Programme,Siyuan Programme,"Siyuan Programme（simplified Chinese: 思源计划; traditional Chinese：思源計劃; pinyin: Sīyuán Jìhuà）is a training programme for excellent students at Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Renmin University of China, Xiamen University, Sun Yat-sen University and Jilin University. This programme is sponsored by Professional & Educational Services Ltd (PESI) and is carried out under the leadership of both Student Department of School Committee of Communist Party and School Committee of Youth League. With the idea of “ Receive help, Self-Help and then Help Others”, Siyuan is aimed at training excellent students to understand the essence of dedication, innovation and leadership. Every spring, Siyuan will recruit its new members from freshmen; those elected are out-standing students with different major backgrounds. Once admitted, these students will have the chance to be trained at social work, to perceive the situation of the country and to cultivate a global horizon.

Siyuan started in Tsinghua and has spread to other 5 universities by now. It selects 30 students a year from each university.

Name 

The name of the programme, Siyuan, which means “to remember the wellhead”in Chinese, comes from the Chinese idiom “Never forget where one's happiness comes from”. This name is closely related to the concept and idea of this programme. (For more, please refer to the “Idea” part.)

Sponsor 

The initiator of Siyuan Programme is Doctor QIAN Bingyi, who is now the director of Professional Education Systems Institute (PESI), which is a Non-Profit organization of people united by Chinese-North in California, founded in 1988. The organization works for promoting the education and profession exchange between North America and Asia. Dr. Qian graduated from University of California, Berkeley and gets his PHD at University of California, San Francisco.

Another initiator is Mr. ZHU Weiren(Sandy Chau), who is both a successful entrepreneur in the IT industry and a kind Philanthropist. He is now a board member of Achievo Corporation in California, the USA and the president of Shin Shin Educational Foundation, US. He also graduated from UC Berkeley.

Tsinghua Entrepreneurs & Executive Club (TEEC) is an independent non-government organization founded by Tsinghua alumni, dedicated toward promoting innovation and start-ups in high-tech industries. When Mr. Zhu Weiren decided to set up the Siyuan Programme in Tsinghua, he wanted to match each student in this programme with a mentor. Some Tsinghua alumni who have carved out in IT industry came up with the idea to start up Tsinghua Entrepreneur Group (TEG), the predecessor of TEEC. There is a Siyuan Committee in TEEC to deal with the contact between entrepreneurs and students. TEEC has been supporting Siyuan Programme since it was set up in 2001.

Idea 

The idea of Siyuan can be interpreted as “Receive help, Self-Help and Help Others”. Actually, this idea was first put forward by the founders of TEEC. Narrowly speaking, “Receive help” means that Tsinghua students benefit from Tsinghua’s education ; “Self-Help” means that Tsinghua alumni help each other when they go to work and fight for their cause; “Help Others” means that successful alumni give their hands to students with their experience. But in a general sense, Siyuaners prefer the following explanation. “Be Helped” means “be helped by anyone when they need help especially when they are at school”, “Self-Help” means “help each other who are related to Siyuan Programme especially students themselves”, “Help Others” means “help those who need help most according to one’s capability”. The “cycle” lays stress on social responsibility and the spirit of service.

Training Programme 

Every student selected by the programme will be trained according to the training plan. The current version of the plan contains two main aspects: summer practice and training during the semesters. 

The summer practice will last throughout the whole four years of these undergraduates. They take part in three practice programme during three summer holidays respectively. The themes of the three practice programme are “Rural and China”, “Economics and China” and “Globe and China”. During “Rural and China”, which is in the first summer, students go to underdeveloped areas in China. They support the education there as tutors and investigate the poverty and problems of development. “Economics and China” requires students to go to the developed areas in China, such as the Yangtze River Delta, to realize the fast development after the Reforming and Opening-up Policy was carried out in 1978. In the third year, with the programme “Globe and China”, students go to Hong Kong to broad their horizons and understand the globalization of China today.

During the three years at school, there are also three themes: “Team Work”, “Volunteerism and Organizing Skills” and “Leadership Training”. Students will take part in orientation, a course called “Introduction to the Social Service of College Students”, youth forums, etc.

Organization 

Every spring, Siyuan will select excellent freshmen from all departments. After the writing test and interview, the list of new Siyuaners will be open to the public. Students graduated in different years are named after ordinal numbers. The first Siyuaners are the 2001 ones, who are called Siyuan 1st, so the most recent ones are called Siyuan 7th. There will be one or two support tutors assigned to the new Siyuaners every year.

Siyuan is organized under the leadership of Organization Department of School Committee of Youth League. In the year 2008, Siyuan formed a complete organization called Siyuan Group. There are 5 subgroups in charge of Contact & Investigation, Propaganda & Planning, Inner Quality Expanding, Networks & Websites, Internal Liaison and Recruiting separately. The Siyuaners manage themselves in this organization and facilitate the development of the programme.

The mission of Contact & Investigation Group is to do some researches on the influence the programme itself has on Siyuaners, i.e. whether they have understood the idea of “Be Helped, Self-Help and Help Others”. Besides, they have to update the contact information so that Siyuaners can keep in touch with each other even when they graduate from school.

Planning & Promotion Group takes charge of the propaganda work. They edit stuff to bring this programme known to outsiders. The materials will also be useful when the website is being set up. Sponsors, teachers and assistants are all glad to keep up with what Siyuaners are doing now. So Propaganda & Planning Group plays really an important role.

Inner Quality Expanding Group searches for information of lectures, exhibitions and performances. Then they organize Siyuaners in different grades to attend these activities, which not only edifies their minds but also facilitates communications. 

Networks & Websites Group is in charge of Siyuan’s own website. The website hasn’t been set up until Nov, 2008.

Internal Liaison Group organizes literature and sport activities regularly to build up relations between Siyuaners, which include some favorite and popular ones, such as football games and Kara OK.

Recruiting Group recruits new members for the programme. Every spring, they filter resumes, design examinations, help to interview students and finally help to decide who will be selected as new members.

These chapters execute the fraternity national programs to provide opportunities for the development of service projects and programs, social awareness, friendship and leadership skills.

Alpha Phi Omega also has a number of extension efforts, which are groups that are preparing to become active chapters. Such groups begin initially as an Interest Group, and then become Petitioning Groups before gaining (or regaining) their charter and becoming Active Chapters. Altogether, this extension process takes approximately one to two years.

Information is current as of September 26, 2016.

Chapter Geographical information

Alpha Phi Omega organizes the country into 11 geographical regions numbered generally East to West. These regions are designated with Roman Numerals. Each of these Regions elects a Region Chair (position formerly known as Regional Director) who represents them on the National Operations Council. Each of these Regions are further divided into between 3 and 9 sections.

Chapter Chronological information

Alpha Phi Omega chapters can be chartered at any accredited four year or two year college or university in the United States.

Hellenistic period
The Hellenistic period began with Alexander the Great's conquest of Palestine in 332 BCE and ended with Pompey's conquest of Palestine in 63 BCE. Alternatively, it can be considered to end with the victory of Rome's client king, Herod the Great, over the last Hasmonean king of Judea in 37 BCE.

824,318180,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress%20Jing%C5%AB,Empress Jingū,"was a legendary Japanese empress who ruled as a regent following her husband's death in 200 AD. Both the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki (collectively known as the Kiki) record events that took place during Jingū's alleged lifetime. Legends say that after seeking revenge on the people who murdered her husband, she then turned her attention to a ""promised land"". Jingū is thus considered to be a controversial monarch by historians in terms of her alleged invasion of the Korean Peninsula. This was in turn possibly used as justification for imperial expansion during the Meiji period. The records state that Jingū gave birth to a baby boy whom she named Homutawake three years after he was conceived by her late husband. 

Jingū's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 201 to 269 AD, and was considered to be the 15th Japanese imperial ruler until the Meiji period. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the name ""Jingū"" was used by later generations to describe this legendary Empress. It has also been proposed that Jingū actually reigned later than she is attested. While the location of Jingū's grave (if any) is unknown, she is traditionally venerated at a kofun and at a shrine. It is accepted today that Empress Jingū reigned as a regent until her son became Emperor Ōjin upon her death. She was additionally the last de facto ruler of the Yayoi period.

Legendary narrative

The Japanese have traditionally accepted this regent's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Jingū is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, which are collectively known as  or Japanese chronicles. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. Records show that Jingū's birth name was , and that she was born sometime in 169 AD. Her father was named , and her mother . Her mother is noted for being a descendant of , a legendary prince of Korea. At some point in time she wed Tarashinakahiko (or Tarashinakatsuhiko), who would later be known as Emperor Chūai and bore him one child under a now disputed set of events. Jingū would serve as ""Empress consort"" during Chūai's reign until his death in 200 AD.

Emperor Chūai died in 200 AD having been killed directly or indirectly in battle by rebel forces. Okinagatarashi-hime no Mikoto then turned her rage on the rebels whom she vanquished in a fit of revenge. She led an army in an invasion of a ""promised land"" (sometimes interpreted as lands on the Korean Peninsula), and returned to Japan victorious after three years. She then ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne as Empress Jingū, and legend continues by saying that her son was conceived but unborn when Chūai died. After those three years she gave birth to a baby boy whom she named Homutawake. The narrative of Empress Jingū invading and conquering the Korean Peninsula is now considered controversial and up for debate as it involves both the Japanese and Korean point of view. According to the Nihon Shoki, the king of Baekje gifted Jingū a Seven-Branched Sword sometime in 253 AD. Empress Jingū was the de facto ruler until her death in 269 at the age of 100. The modern traditional view is that Chūai's son (Homutawake) became the next Emperor after Jingū acted as a regent. She would have been de facto ruler in the interim.

Known information

Empress consort Jingū is regarded by historians as a legendary figure  as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The lack of this information has made her very existence open to debate. If Empress Jingū was an actual figure, investigations of her tomb suggest she may have been a regent in the late 4th century AD or late 5th century AD. There is no evidence to suggest that the title tennō was used during the time to which Jingū's regency has been assigned. It is certainly possible that she was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity she ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Jingū was more than likely assigned to her posthumously by later generations, during her lifetime she would have been called Okinaga-Tarashi respectively. Empress Jingū was later removed from the imperial lineage during the reign of Emperor Meiji as a way of making sure the lineage remained unbroken. This occurred when examining the emperors of the Northern Court and Southern Court of the fourteenth century. Focus was given on who should be the ""true"" ancestors of those who occupied the throne.

Gosashi kofun 
While the actual site of Jingū's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a kofun-type Imperial tomb in Nara. This Kofun is also known as the ""Gosashi tomb"", and is managed by the Imperial Household Agency. The tomb was restricted from archaeology studies in 1976 as the tomb dates back to the founding of a central Japanese state under imperial rule. The Imperial Household Agency had also cited ""tranquility and dignity"" concerns in their decision making. Serious ethics concerns had been raised in 2000 after a massive archaeological hoax was exposed. Things changed in 2008 when Japan allowed limited access to Jingū's kofun to foreign archaeologists who were able to determine that the tomb likely dated to the 4th century AD. The examination also discovered haniwa terracotta figures. Empress Jingū is also enshrined at Sumiyoshi-taisha in Osaka, which was established in the 11th year of her reign (211 AD).

Controversy

Birth of Ōjin and Jingū's Identity
According to the Kiki, Empress Jingū gave birth to a baby boy whom she named Homutawake (aka Emperor Ōjin) following her return from Korean conquest. The legend alleges that her son was conceived but unborn when Emperor Chūai died. As three more years would pass before Homutawake was finally born, this claim appears to be mythical and symbolic rather than real. Scholar William George Aston has suggested that this claim was misinterpreted, and instead refers to a period of less than nine months containing three ""years"" (some seasons), e.g. three harvests. If Ōjin was an actual historical figure then historians have proposed that he ruled later than attested years of 270 to 310 AD.

Jingū's identity has since been questioned by medieval and modern scholars whom have put forward different theories. Kitabatake Chikafusa (1293–1354) and Arai Hakuseki (1657–1725) asserted that she was actually the shaman-queen Himiko. The kiki does not include any mentions of Queen Himiko, and the circumstances under which these books were written is a matter of unending debate. Even if such a person was known to the authors of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, they may have purposefully decided not to include her. However, they do include imperial-family shamans identified with her which include Jingū. Modern scholars such as Naitō Torajirō have stated that Jingū was actually Yamatohime-no-mikoto and that Wa armies obtained control of southern Korea. Yamatohime-no-Mikoto supposedly founded the Ise Shrine in tribute to the sun-goddess Amaterasu. While historian Higo Kazuo suggested that she is a daughter of Emperor Kōrei (Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto).

Korean Invasion

Both the Nihon Shoki, and the Kojiki give accounts of how Okinaga-Tarashi (Jingū) led an army to invade a ""promised land"" (sometimes interpreted as lands on the Korean Peninsula). She then returned to Japan victorious after three years of conquest where she was proclaimed as Empress. The second volume of the Kojiki (中巻 or ""Nakatsumaki"") states that the Korean kingdom of Baekje (百済 or ""Kudara"") paid tribute to Japan under ""Tribute from Korea"". While the Nihon Shoki states that Jingū conquered a region in southern Korea in the 3rd century AD naming it ""Mimana"". One of the main proponents of this theory was Japanese scholar Suematsu Yasukazu, who in 1949 proposed that Mimana was a Japanese colony on the Korean peninsula that existed from the 3rd until the 6th century. The Chinese Book of Song of the Liu Song dynasty also allegedly notes the Japanese presence in the Korean Peninsula, while the Book of Sui says that Japan provided military support to Baekje and Silla.

In 1883, a memorial stele for the tomb of King Gwanggaeto (374 – 413) of Goguryeo was discovered and hence named the Gwanggaeto Stele. An issue arose though, when the inscriptions describing events during the king's reign were found to be in bad condition with portions illegible. At the center of the disagreement is the ""sinmyo passage"" of year 391 as it can be interpreted in multiple ways. Korean scholars maintain that it states the Goguryeo subjugated Baekje and Silla, while Japanese scholars have traditionally interpreted that Wa had at one time subjugated Baekje and Silla. The stele soon caught the interest of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, who obtained a rubbed copy from its member Kageaki Sakō in 1884. They particularly became intrigued over the passage describing the king's military campaigns for the sinmyo in 391 AD. Additional research was done by some officers in the Japanese army and navy, and the rubbed copy was later published in 1889. The interpretation was made by Japanese scholars at the time that the ""Wa"" had occupied and controlled the Korean Peninsula. The legends of Empress Jingū's conquest of Korea could have then been used by Imperial Japan as reasoning for their annexation of Korea in 1910 as ""restoring"" unity between the two countries. As it was, Imperialists had already used this historical claim to justify expansion into the Korean Peninsula. 

The main issue with an invasion scenario is a lack of remaining evidence of Jingū's rule in Korea. This suggests that the accounts given are either fictional or an inaccurate/misleading account of events that occurred. According to the book ""From Paekchae Korea to the Origin of Yamato Japan"", the Japanese had misinterpreted the Gwanggaeto Stele. The Stele was a tribute to a Korean king, but because of a lack of correct punctuation, the writing can be translated in 4 different ways. This same Stele can also be interpreted as saying Korea crossed the strait and forced Japan into subjugation, depending on where the sentence is punctuated. An investigation done by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2006 suggested that the inscription chould also be interpreted as; ""Silla and Baekje were dependent states of Yamato Japan.""

The imperialist reasoning for occupation eventually led to an emotional repulsion from Jingu after World War II had ended as she had symbolized Japan's nationalistic foreign policy. Historian Chizuko Allen notes that while these feelings are understandable, they are not academically justifiable. The overall popularity of the Jingū theory has been declining since the 1970s due to concerns raised about available evidence.

Legacy

In 1881, Empress Jingū became the first woman to be featured on a Japanese banknote; however, since no actual images of this legendary figure are known to exist, the representation of Jingū which was artistically contrived by Edoardo Chiossone is entirely conjectural. Actually, Chiossone used a female employee of the Government Printing Bureau as model. This picture was also used for 1908/14 postage stamps, the first postage stamps of Japan to show a woman. A revised design by Yoshida Toyo was used for 1924/37 Jingū design stamps. The usage of a Jingū design ended with a new stamp series in 1939.

Excluding the legendary Empress Jingū, there were eight reigning empresses and their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.

825,285012,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo%20Cienfuegos,Camilo Cienfuegos,"Camilo Cienfuegos Gorriarán (; 6 February 1932 – 28 October 1959) was a Cuban revolutionary born in Havana. Along with Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Juan Almeida Bosque, and Raúl Castro, he was a member of the 1956 Granma expedition, which launched Fidel Castro's armed insurgency against the government of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. He became one of Castro's top guerrilla commanders, known as the ""Hero of Yaguajay"" after winning a key battle of the Cuban Revolution. His signature weapons were a M1921AC Thompson and a modified M2 carbine.

He was appointed head of Cuba's armed forces shortly after the victory of Castro's rebel army in 1959. He was presumed dead when a small plane he was traveling in disappeared during a night flight from Camagüey to Havana later that year. Many have speculated and conspiracies have arisen concerning his mysterious disappearance. Cienfuegos, whose name translates in English to ""a hundred fires,"" is revered in Cuba as a hero of the Revolution, with monuments, memorials, and an annual celebration in his honor.

Early life
Camilo Cienfuegos, born on 6 February 1932 in Havana's Lawton district, grew up in a working-class family that had emigrated from Spain prior to the civil war of 1936–39. His father, a tailor who worked a small shop in Havana, had left-wing political principles.

Artistically inclined since early youth, Camilo enrolled in the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes ""San Alejandro"" in 1950, but left his studies soon after due to financial problems. During this period he started working as a tailor apprentice in ""El Arte,"" a fashion store in downtown Havana.

Around 1948 he became involved in politics, initially taking part in popular protests against rising bus-fares. In April 1953, Cienfuegos and a friend traveled to the U.S. on 29-day visitors' visas in search of work. They spent several months working low-paying jobs in New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco until immigration officials took them into custody and returned them to Cuba via Mexico. While in New York, Cienfuegos became involved with a Cuban political exile group and wrote a few articles for its newspaper, La Voz de Cuba (""The Voice of Cuba"").

In personality, writes one historian, Cienfuegos ""exemplified the quintessential native, male, urban Cuban with his sense of humor, great interest in dancing and baseball, good looks, love of women, and overall joie de vivre"". Rufo López-Fresquet, who served as Minister of Finance for the first fourteen months of the revolutionary regime, described him as ""a happy-go-lucky, adventuresome sort"".

Political awakening
In 1954, Cienfuegos became an active member of the underground student movement against autocratic President Fulgencio Batista. On 5 December 1955, the eve of the anniversary of the death of 19th-century Cuban independence hero Antonio Maceo, soldiers opened fire on Cienfuegos and other students who were returning to their Havana university after placing a wreath on Maceo's monument. Cienfuegos later described this as the moment in which he pledged himself to freeing Cuba from the Batista dictatorship. Jobless and harassed by police, he left Cuba in March 1956 and again traveled to the US, where he worked in Miami and San Francisco for a few weeks before heading to Mexico, intent on joining a small Cuban rebel army being organized by Fidel Castro. On arriving in Mexico, Cienfuegos befriended Castro and began training with the rebels. He was one of the 82 revolutionaries who set sail for Cuba aboard the Granma in November 1956.

Cienfuegos was not as ""politically sophisticated"" as the Castros or Guevara, and has been described as ""ideologically an unknown quantity"". He was not particularly dogmatic. On the question of tactics, he departed from many others in the revolutionary movement in rejecting violence and revenge. In October 1958, when a Cuban Masonic organization expressed concern that someone captured by the rebels might be tortured and killed, he replied:

Guerrilla activities

The Granma arrived in Cuba on 2 December. After three days of swamps and mangroves, the rebels were surprised by Batista's forces at Alegría de Pío. The surviving rebels escaped in small dispersed groups and wandered for weeks in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Cienfuegos was one of the twelve who survived to rejoin Castro a month later.

In 1957, he became one of the leaders of the revolutionary forces, appointed to the rank of Comandante. In 1958, after the collapse of the  government's Operation Verano, Cienfuegos was put in command of one of three columns which headed west out of the mountains with the intention of capturing the provincial capital city of Santa Clara. Che Guevara was in command of another column and Jaime Vega was in command of the third. Vega's column was ambushed and defeated by Batista's forces.

Cienfuegos' and Guevara's columns reached the central provinces, where they combined their efforts with  other groups. Cienfuegos' column attacked an army outpost at Yaguajay and, after a tough fight, forced the garrison to surrender on 30 December 1958. This earned him the nickname ""The Hero of Yaguajay."" Cienfuegos then advanced against Santa Clara in conjunction with Guevara's forces, and the other non-Castro forces from the Escambray front. Together, the two columns captured Santa Clara on 31 December. Most of the defenders surrendered without firing their weapons. Batista fled Cuba the next day, leaving the guerrilla fighters victorious. At a rally on 8 January 1959, Castro interrupted his speech to ask Cienfuegos ""¿Voy bien, Camilo?"" (""Am I doing all right, Camilo?"") His response ""Vas bien, Fidel"" (""You're doing fine, Fidel"") was taken up by the crowd and became a slogan of the revolution.

For the next several months, Cienfuegos served as Chief of Staff of the Cuban Army, helped defeat several anti-Castro uprisings, and played a role in implementing the regime's agrarian reforms.

Death
Huber Matos, military chief of Camagüey province, had complained to Fidel Castro that communists were being allowed to occupy leadership positions in the revolutionary government and the army. Finding Castro unwilling to discuss his concerns, Matos, on 19 October, sent a letter to Castro resigning his command. Castro the next day denounced Matos. He sent troops to occupy key positions in  Camagüey, expecting incorrectly that Matos would lead a revolt, and named Cienfuegos to take command and to arrest Matos. Matos pleaded with Cienfuegos to listen to his concerns, but Cienfuegos assured him it could be worked out and arrested Matos on 21 October.

On the late evening of 28 October 1959, Cienfuegos' Cessna 310 ('FAR-53') disappeared over the Straits of Florida during a night flight, returning from Camagüey to Havana. An immediate search lasted several days, but the plane was not found. By mid-November, the search was called off and Cienfuegos was presumed lost at sea. He quickly became a hero and martyr for the Cuban revolution. Cienfuegos' disappearance remains unexplained. There is some debate in regard to Cienfuegos' death, although Cuban historians do not believe that there was any foul play by the government. There is speculation that Fidel was responsible, which Matos believes is the case. Despite the fact of Cienfuegos' evidently exceptional loyalty to Castro, he hesitantly supported the arrest of his friend Matos only days earlier. Che Guevara, who was close to Cienfuegos and named his son Camilo in his honor, dismissed the notion of Castro's involvement. Others offer the possibility that a Cuban air force fighter plane mistook Cienfuegos' plane for a hostile intruder and shot it down. In the words of U.S. Ambassador Philip Bonsal, Cienfuegos enjoyed Havana's nightlife and he ""may have had a penchant for friendships and associations deemed undesirable by some of his more austere revolutionary comrades"". There has also been speculation that Cienfuegos faked his death and fled to the US, as some speculate it may have been to Ybor City in Tampa.

Remembrance

Che Guevara stated about Cienfuegos the following:

Cuba has named a socialist award, the Order of Cienfuegos, after him. On 28 October, school children throughout Cuba throw flowers into the sea or a river to honor Camilo Cienfuegos, repeating the spontaneous tribute of the Cubans who tossed flowers into the ocean when they heard his plane had been lost over the Cuba Florida Strait. Camilo is also remembered on the 20 Cuban peso bill and the 20 Cuban convertible peso bill. He was also pictured on the 40-cent coins, now discontinued. 

The University of Matanzas bears the name ""Camilo Cienfuegos"". A series of military high schools for students aged 11 to 17 are named the Camilo Cienfuegos Schools. Its graduates receive priority admission to cadet schools. The neighborhood known until 1950 as ""Central Hershey,"" in the municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, Havana, was renamed Central Camilo Cienfuegos.

A museum dedicated to Cienfuegos –the Monumento y MuseoCamilo Cienfuegos– was built after his death in Yaguajay, at the site of the barracks of the Batista's forces during the 1958 battle. The museum includes a diorama of the battle, as well as material relating to Cienfuegos' life before, during, and after the revolution. A large statue of him stands in front of the museum.

In the 2008 film Che, the character of Cienfuegos was ""played with great verve"" by Santiago Cabrera.

On 28 October 2009, to note the 50th anniversary of his death, a 100-ton steel outline of Cienfuegos' face and the words Vas bien, Fidel was added to the side of the Ministry of Informatics and Communications building on the Plaza de la Revolución.

826,14819156,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck%20Bartowski,Chuck Bartowski,"Charles Irving Bartowski is the title character of the American spy show Chuck on NBC.  He is portrayed by Zachary Levi. UGO.com named him one of the best TV nerds.

Character profile
At the outset of the show, Chuck Bartowski is presented as a twenty-something underachiever who lives in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California and works at a dead end job at the Burbank Buy More in its Nerd Herd division (a fictionalized Geek Squad). Chuck's life stalled after his college roommate, Bryce Larkin, planted test answers under Chuck's bed and then reported him to the officials, which led to Chuck's expulsion from Stanford University (where he was a scholarship student) in 2002; only twelve credits shy of completing his Bachelor of Engineering degree. For a long time, Chuck hated Bryce for his betrayal, but he later learns that Bryce got him expelled to protect him from being recruited into the CIA because he knew Chuck wouldn't survive in the field. He also lost his college girlfriend, Jill Roberts (Jordana Brewster). Following his expulsion, Chuck moved in with his sister and began working at the Burbank, California branch of Buy More.  At some point over the next five years Chuck becomes the Nerd Herd supervisor.

That's his job at the time of the pilot, when the viewers are introduced to the key people in Chuck's current life: his older sister, Eleanor Fay ""Ellie"" Bartowski, M.D. (Sarah Lancaster), her live-in boyfriend, Devon ""Captain Awesome"" Woodcomb (Ryan McPartlin) and Chuck's best friend since childhood, Morgan Grimes. Very little else is known about his family. His mother left when Chuck was in the fifth grade and his father was ""never really around"" even before he also left (roughly eleven years ago), so Chuck and Ellie increasingly had to fend for themselves.

On his birthday in 2007, Chuck opens an email from Bryce Larkin that causes Chuck to download into his brain the full contents of a CIA/NSA supercomputer known as the Intersect, which has served as a database for their combined collected intelligence. Unbeknownst to Chuck, the Intersect computer has been destroyed, making his brain the only location of this top-secret information.  The government learns that Chuck Bartowski was the last known person that Bryce Larkin contacted, so both the CIA and NSA (independent of each other) send agents to find him.  The CIA dispatches field officer Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) to retrieve a copy of the Intersect, while the NSA sends then-Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin) to capture Chuck.  The two agents eventually cross paths, and Sarah fends off Casey.  They then discover that Chuck is a human version of the Intersect who sees a rapid-fire series of images (or ""flashes"") of intelligence from the Intersect database whenever his brain recognizes a bit of related information with his own eyes or ears.  The two agencies conclude that Chuck must be protected and assign Sarah and Casey jointly to the task.

Series development
Chuck is the lead character on the show.  Thus, major seasonal plot arcs generally revolve around the weekly missions that Chuck, Sarah and Casey engage in, as well as Chuck's relationships with Morgan Grimes (his best friend and co-worker), his fellow Nerd Herders and co-workers, his sister Ellie and her boyfriend (later husband) Devon.  Chuck is also very worried about his future and wants desperately to remove the Intersect from his brain, although by the beginning of season three he has come to accept his role as the Intersect.  Chuck is often involved in the major and secondary episodic plots and the two sometimes intertwine.

Sarah Walker

A major thread throughout the series is that Chuck is in love with his CIA protector Sarah, who is pretending to be his girlfriend as part of her cover story. The two characters continue to become closer despite frequent setbacks and constant resistance due to their circumstances.

Sarah is depicted as slower to recognize her own feelings toward Chuck than the other way around, and for various reasons has been reluctant to voice her feelings. Despite Sarah characteristically hiding her real feelings, several other characters have detected a genuine attraction and pointed it out, as early as ""Chuck Versus the Wookiee"" when Carina (Mini Anden), who is familiar with Sarah, tells Chuck that Sarah wants him, though she probably doesn't even know it yet.

Sarah and Chuck have shared kisses under unusual circumstances in ""Chuck Versus the Imported Hard Salami"" and ""Chuck Versus the Seduction"". In the former case, Sarah kisses Chuck seconds before the countdown on what they believe to be a bomb reaches zero. In the latter case, Seduction trainer Roan Montgomery (John Larroquette) quickly discerned that there was more than a working relationship between Chuck and Sarah.

Sarah maintains that it would be unprofessional of her to actually engage in a real relationship with Chuck while she is serving as his CIA handler, and indeed her feelings for him have proven to be a liability at times, placing the mission and both of their lives at risk.

Complicating the developing relationship between Chuck and Sarah are a series of love triangles.

The longest-running triangle involved Chuck's nemesis Bryce Larkin, who was previously partnered with Sarah and developed a romantic relationship with her which he still wishes to pursue. During Bryce's return in ""Chuck Versus the Nemesis"", Sarah is clearly torn between Larkin and Chuck. However, when he later reappears in ""Chuck Versus the Break-Up"", the situation has changed. Sarah chooses Chuck's safety over their assigned mission objectives, and when later confronted by Captain Awesome (who correctly and unknowingly recognized that Sarah's feelings for Chuck are genuine and not part of her cover), Bryce realizes that Sarah has chosen Chuck. At the end of the mission, Bryce warns Chuck that her feelings nearly got both her and Chuck killed, and have interfered with her performance.  Bryce claims that in this, as always, he is looking out for Chuck, and challenges Chuck to ""do the right thing"" as usual.  Chuck acquiesces and tells Sarah that regardless of how they feel towards each other, they can never be together.

Sarah also has a minor love triangle with Cole Barker, an MI6 agent who, like Bryce, contrasts with Chuck—he is a skilled spy who excels in combat, has a high tolerance for pain and a suave personality. Chuck is of course afraid that Sarah will fall for him. However, when Cole asks Sarah to board a jet to Fiji with him, Sarah turns him down. Cole says ""What's the matter I thought you were a girl who liked adventure."" Sarah then says ""I guess I'm not the type of girl who cheats on her cover boyfriend (Chuck)."" Cole then asks her if that's all Chuck is to her, saying that he saw the way she looked at him when he was in danger. Sarah then says: ""When you meet somebody you care about it's just hard to walk away."" Making it obvious she is in love with Chuck.

The other two love triangles involved Chuck seeking a real relationship, with Lou the sandwich girl (Rachel Bilson) and later with his ex-girlfriend Jill Roberts. In both cases, Sarah becomes jealous and protective, though she makes more of an effort to give Chuck space with Jill.

Sarah's feelings for Chuck and their ramifications for their mission are the focus of ""Chuck Versus the Broken Heart"", when Beckman decides Sarah and Chuck are too close emotionally, leading her to temporarily replace her with Agent Alexandra Forrest (the 49B). After the mission takes a turn for the worse, it becomes clear that the strong emotional bond between Chuck and Sarah is more of an asset than a liability, leading Beckman to reinstate Sarah's position.

At the end of ""Chuck Versus the First Kill"", Beckman orders Sarah to lure Chuck to Castle so he could be taken into custody and returned to Washington. Feeling guilt in the act of betraying him, Sarah instead warns Chuck of the plan and reveals that they thus have to flee. They nearly have sex in ""Chuck Versus the Colonel"", but a series of circumstances, including the arrival of John Casey, interrupts them.

Despite their apparently genuine connection at the close of ""Chuck Versus the Colonel"", Chuck now free from the intersect, Sarah wavers in ""Chuck Versus the Ring"" between leaving Chuck on her new assignment (the new Intersect project with Bryce Larkin) and staying with him.  She ultimately chooses to stay with Chuck, which resolves that love triangle, but Chuck doesn't learn of her choice until Bryce tells him in the Intersect room.  Despite this knowledge, and reflecting on her confidence in him as a hero, Chuck uploads the new Intersect. Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak have suggested that Chuck re-uploading the Intersect will have implications for his developing relationship with Sarah. Josh Schwartz says that ""in a way, she becomes his Kryptonite"" as Chuck's emotional state will impact his ability to control his new Intersect.

By the beginning of ""Chuck Versus the Pink Slip"", Chuck's relationship with Sarah has been shattered. Flashbacks over the course of the episode reveal that Sarah asked him to go AWOL and run away with her to be together. Chuck was initially happy to do so, but by the time he met with her at their agreed rendezvous point had changed his mind and declined so he could go to Prague and become a real spy. Sarah was heartbroken and cut off contact with him. Their relationship was partially mended by the end of ""Chuck Versus the Three Words"" when Carina shows Sarah security footage of a failed attempt by Chuck to explain the situation: He had to turn her down because of the sense of duty and confidence Sarah instilled in him, and that he knew he needed to be a real spy to protect those he loves—Sarah included.

Chuck admitted directly to Sarah he wanted to be with her in ""Chuck Versus the Final Exam"" and asked her to run away with him in ""Chuck Versus the American Hero"".  In ""Chuck Versus the Other Guy"", Sarah saw the lengths to which Chuck was willing to go when he misappropriated a government strike team in an attempt to rescue her when he believed Shaw intended to kill her. Chuck's misgivings over Shaw's stability after learning Sarah was the one who killed his wife proved well-founded when Shaw revealed he had been turned to the Ring, and he was forced to shoot Shaw when Sarah's life was in danger. Chuck and Sarah subsequently began a real relationship and had sex in a hotel room in Paris.

He and Sarah did attempt to run away from the spy life together in ""Chuck Versus the Honeymooners"", however a run-in with a surrendering Basque terrorist led them both to realize (with the advice of the terrorist) that they wanted to ""have it all"", being together without giving up their jobs. Although Beckman was not pleased when she learned of their relationship, even she noted ""it's about damn time"".  In ""Chuck Versus the Role Models"", Chuck hints that he and Sarah could be together in 30 years.

In ""Chuck Versus the Cubic Z"", Chuck accidentally proposes to Sarah when he found Big Mike's engagement ring and held it out to her. In ""Chuck Versus the Coup d'Etat"" it is revealed that both walked away awkwardly but at the end of the episode, Sarah, taking the advice from a self-help book, reveals to Chuck while he is asleep in bed that nothing could ever change her love for him and that if Chuck really were to propose, she would say ""yes"". Chuck, seemingly sleeping, slowly grins.

In ""Chuck Versus Phase Three"", it is revealed that Chuck had been planning a proposal to Sarah. Before she goes on a rogue mission to find Chuck (after he was kidnapped in the previous episode), Sarah tells Casey ""I'm different without Chuck, and I don't like it""; she proves this by kidnapping a Thai aide, and threatening his life by injecting him with ammonia. When she finds Chuck, he is unconscious and has nearly completed Phase Three-a lobotomy removing all portions of his brain not pertaining to the Intersect. She tells him that she would marry him if he were to propose.

Chuck attempted to propose in ""Chuck Versus the Balcony"" but is repeatedly disrupted. Sarah overhears him discuss the plan with Morgan and recruits Grimes to make sure the next attempt succeeds. However just as Chuck is about to pop the question Sarah is arrested as a setup for an undercover operation.

In ""Chuck Versus the Push Mix"" Chuck proposes to Sarah. By ""Chuck Versus the Seduction Impossible"", it is revealed that Sarah has said yes. Sarah asks Chuck to elope, but Chuck disagrees, wanting to have a big ""family wedding."" The two go so far as to attempt to seduce each other into agreeing, but Sarah relents and agrees to Chuck's version of the wedding.

Chuck and Sarah marry in ""Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger"".

In ""Chuck Versus Sarah"", Sarah has forgotten all about Chuck after having her mind wiped by the intersect in ""Chuck Versus the Bullet Train"". She was given false information about her past by Nicholas Quinn, and was under the impression that Chuck used the intersect for evil reasons. Chuck tries to convince her otherwise, however, she doesn't believe him, and nearly resorts to killing Chuck until she saw ""Sarah + Chuck"" engraved in the wall of their dream house. Casey later gives Sarah a disc of all of Sarah's video logs from when she was Chuck's handler. After watching the videos, Sarah tells Chuck that she believes his claims, but that she doesn't feel the love for him that he feels for her. At the end of the series in ""Chuck Versus the Goodbye"", Chuck tells Sarah about their story, and Sarah asks Chuck to kiss her, which he does, as the series ends.

The Intersect
Chuck becomes a CIA asset when his former nemesis ""Bryce Larkin"" (Matthew Bomer) sends him an email containing coded images. When he opens the email the Intersect 1.0 is downloaded onto his brain. Later Bryce Larkin gives Chuck intersect glasses (at the time Chuck believed they were sunglasses) that upgrade the intersect with new Intel that was discovered after he (Bryce) sent Chuck the email. Then on a mission against Fulcrum Chuck has a Fulcrum test intersect downloaded onto his brain. Later Bryce Larkin is chosen to receive the Intersect 2.0 but it is a trap. The bodyguards accompanying him into the Intersect room were double agents. When Sarah, Casey, and Chuck come to save him Bryce is shot. In no condition to obtain the Intersect Chuck does it instead (by command of Bryce) he downloads the Intersect then destroys the upload computer that previously stored the Intersect (also on Bryce's command). When the double agents eventually break into the room (with Sarah and Casey as hostages) Chuck discovers that the intersect contains a program that makes the agent an ultimate Kung Fu, gun firing, ninja star throwing, ETC master! After the brutal but short fight Chuck says, ""I know Kung Fu"" this later becomes an unofficial code word which means the person who says it has the Intersect in his brain.

Spy life

In many episodes Chuck has adopted a fantasy alias, ""Charles Carmichael"", who is endowed with all the characteristics he believes a super-spy should have, except he doesn't really have the physical abilities to go with the skills. Carmichael has been referred to as where Chuck thought he would be by this time in his life had he not been expelled from Stanford: a millionaire semiretired software magnate. His fantasy alias has gained respect in the spy community: in ""Chuck Versus the Predator"", Fulcrum agent Vincent told Chuck he's heard of him, and the mercenary Mr. Colt was highly impressed with Chuck. His adventures as ""Carmichael"" are also beginning to make him a legend in the CIA community. His operational aliases are numerous; various false passports and identity documents are stored in a shoebox under his bed, as seen in the beginning of ""Chuck Versus Tom Sawyer"".

While police and operational backup personnel have supported Casey and Sarah in various episodes, Chuck is revealed near the climax of ""Chuck Versus the Ex"" to have gained the contact information required to summon such teams on his own initiative. Moments later, it is further revealed that Chuck carries a badge and credentials which give him some degree of authority over local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the police and FBI. This is demonstrated in the episode when, upon arriving at an emergency situation where an assassin released a biological weapon on a scientific conference, Chuck promptly assumed command of the operation without dispute from the senior officer on-site. In ""Chuck Versus the Beard"", Chuck reveals to Ring agents Del and Neil that he has ""Level 6"" security clearance, though how high this places him in the CIA security hierarchy has not been expanded on, though it is high enough for Carina to become interested in Chuck.

Chuck has been charting every piece of information he can find on Fulcrum unknown to his handlers, the Intersect and various figures connected to the CIA and NSA on a board hidden behind the Tron poster in his bedroom, and continues to express a desire to have the intel removed from his brain. Using the data, Chuck built a bot to search the web for Orion, which he can be seen using in the opening scenes of ""Chuck Versus the Predator"". He succeeds in doing what the CIA and NSA could not; he gets the attention of Orion who recognizes Chuck as the Intersect and thus wants to meet him. Orion reveals it is possible to remove the Intersect from Chuck's brain before his apparent suicide upon his capture by Fulcrum. It was later revealed in ""Chuck Versus the Dream Job"" that not only did Orion survive, but is actually Chuck's father.

In ""Chuck Versus the Ring"", after Bryce is killed, Chuck downloads the modified Intersect 2.0 before destroying the computer system. When confronted by agents belonging to the Ring who had been intent on taking control of the system, he uses the knowledge received from the Intersect to quickly disable them in hand-to-hand combat. Earlier in the episode, Ted Roark reveals that Fulcrum has specifically ordered that Chuck be killed regardless of whether they recover the Intersect.

Chuck was fired by Beckman after failing his spy training in ""Chuck Versus the Pink Slip"", but by the end of the episode proved his value and was reinstated on the team. He was sent on his first solo mission by Daniel Shaw in ""Chuck Versus First Class"". Throughout the third season Chuck continued to train with Sarah, Casey, and Shaw. In ""Chuck Versus the Final Exam"", Chuck completed his last tests (with Casey's help) and was activated as a full-fledged spy by Beckman and ordered to report to Washington, D.C. for induction. He quits being a spy but after finding his father's secret room it is uncertain whether he'll remain a civilian. In the premiere of season 4, it is revealed that after the success of Operation Bartowski, the President made Chuck a priority and is forced to become a spy again at the orders of Beckman.

It is revealed that Chuck comes from a long line of spies as his father told him through the electronic message.

In ""Chuck Versus the Couch Lock"" Beckman expresses a great deal of pride in Chuck's development as an operative, after Chuck outlines a complex plan to lure Casey's old team out of hiding by using Casey himself as the bait. However. the realization that he is putting his friend in danger for his own purposes unsettles him greatly, and he is prepared to call off his clandestine search for his mother entirely to protect them.

In ""Chuck Versus the Last Details"", Sarah is poisoned by Volkoff Industries' ""Norseman"" weapon, and in ""Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger"", Chuck goes rogue in order to acquire the antidote to save Sarah's life.

At the beginning of season 5, Chuck, Sarah, Casey, and Morgan, have started a freelance spy organization known as ""Carmichael Industries"" using the assets formerly owned by Alexei Volkoff as start-up money. Morgan is now the Human intersect, as he accidentally put on a pair of intersect glasses at the end of season 4, although it is removed in ""Chuck Versus the Business Trip"". However, Carmichael Industries struggles, as they are outshined by Verbanski Corporation, led by Gertrude Verbanski, and had all the money in their account frozen by Clyde Decker in ""Chuck Versus the Zoom"". Towards the middle and end of season 5, Chuck, Sarah, and Casey work alongside Verbanski and Beckman in some joint missions. At the end of the series in ""Chuck Versus the Goodbye"", Chuck is offered a position back in the CIA, but refuses.

Family life

Chuck had been attempting to locate his father for Ellie's wedding but had met with limited success, as Stephen Bartowski didn't want to be found. However, his search ends in ""Chuck Versus the Broken Heart"" when Sarah uses her access to the CIA databases at Langley to run her own unauthorized search. She successfully locates him in a trailer in a field 100 miles east of Barstow, CA and takes Chuck to see him. In ""Chuck Versus the Dream Job"", Stephen reveals his identity as Orion and said he had allowed Sarah to find him. Chuck went to work for Stephen's rival Ted Roark to help the CIA stop a major virus attack. After Stephen's capture by Roark, he convinced Beckman to assign them the mission to rescue him.

Due to his ""exceptional field service"", Chuck received his bachelor's degree in Engineering from Stanford, a degree he was only 12 credits short of earning when he was expelled. Sarah and Casey both played a significant role in this development. In ""Chuck Versus the Dream Job"", we learn that Stephen (his father) is really Orion, the Intersect's creator. Although Stephen J. Bartowski would appear in ""Chuck Versus the Dream Job"", no real information about their mother has been given, except that she left them at a young age and her name is Mary Elizabeth. Chuck and Ellie celebrate ""Mother's Day"" each year with dinner to celebrate the day they both learned to take care of each other.

In the Season Two finale, Chuck quits the Buy More as a wedding present to Ellie, who has been encouraging him to live up to his potential. By the beginning of the third season, Chuck is still living with Ellie and Devon. At the end of the premier, they move out leaving Chuck with the apartment to himself until Morgan agrees to move in (to Ellie's disappointment). Chuck returns to his old position at the Buy More for his cover.

Chuck was ultimately unable to protect his sister from his spy life. By the end of Season Three, the Ring took advantage of Ellie to lure their father out of hiding in an attempt to capture the Governor for Shaw. She was further manipulated by Justin Sullivan and was in his ""protective custody"" when Chuck, Sarah, and Casey unwittingly trailed Shaw to a CIA facility as part of Shaw's plan to discredit Operation Bartowski. Chuck accidentally revealed his spy connections when he punched out Justin in front of Ellie. The events also lead to the death of Stephen, who Shaw murdered for the sole purpose of compromising Chuck's emotions, rendering the Intersect unusable. After being captured by Shaw and then rescued by Ellie, Devon, and Morgan, Chuck agreed to quit the CIA for Ellie's sake once the Ring was defeated.

However, Chuck was forced to begin lying to Ellie again at the beginning of Season 4 after being coerced back into the Agency by General Beckman when his rogue search for his mother coincided with Casey and Sarah's own missions to bring down Volkoff Industries. Chuck did eventually admit to Ellie that he was searching for Mary but kept his return to government work a secret. In ""Chuck Versus the Couch Lock"" Chuck spoke to his mother for the first time—presumably, since she left the family some twenty years earlier—when she contacted him at the conclusion of his operation to extract information on her whereabouts from Casey's old special forces team. Chuck was stunned and disheartened when what he had learned suggested Mary may have been working for Volkoff all along.

Ellie announced to Chuck that she was pregnant at the beginning of season 4, which was a contributing factor to him not telling her of the search for their mother. Ellie's pregnancy progresses as the season goes on, and in the Season 4 mid-season finale, Chuck's niece, Clara, is born.

Character development

Zachary Levi was the first actor cast for the series and was announced as starring in the title role on February 7, 2007. On January 16, 2009, it was announced that Scott Bakula would appear as Chuck and Ellie's father in a three-episode story alongside Chevy Chase.

Interviews with Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz have likened Chuck's development in the first two seasons to an origin story, describing Chuck as Luke Skywalker and born into his role as opposed to Peter Parker who stumbled into it. Season two especially has focused on Chuck's evolution from a regular guy to show that he has the potential to be a true hero.

Zachary Levi has indicated that by the beginning of Season Three, two characters will have discovered Chuck's secret life. In ""Chuck Versus the Colonel"", Chuck reveals his work as a spy to Captain Awesome, but implores him to keep it secret.

Zachary Levi has suggested that the new skills Chuck learns from Intersect 2.0 will fade again after use.

Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak have confirmed that Intersect 2.0 will introduce a number of complications in Chuck's development as a spy. The most significant is that Chuck's emotional state will have a direct impact on the functionality of his abilities, as the modifications his father made at the government's request were designed for Bryce Larkin, a trained agent capable of controlling his feelings. Schwartz and Fedak have indicated Chuck's emotional state could lead to an unpredictable and potentially dangerous response from the Intersect to those around him, and that a substantial part of the third season will center on Chuck learning to control and focus his emotional state and with it his control of the Intersect.

Actor Joshua Rush was added to the recurring cast to play young Chuck in flashbacks. He first appeared in the role in ""Chuck Versus the Ring: Part II"", and returned in the Season 4 premiere, ""Chuck Versus the Anniversary"".

Personality

In relation to spy life
Chuck's personality stands in contrast to the role into which he is thrust, a conflict which drives the series from several angles. Chuck is portrayed as a sincerely well-meaning underachiever, so when he is caught up in a larger struggle, he has to draw on his potential and become something new to meet the threat, while trying to maintain his good nature.

Chuck, who has an aversion to violence and a low tolerance for pain, unwittingly enters a world of people willing to do violence to him. He is caring and sensitive, and those around him are often placed in danger. He is a trusting individual suddenly surrounded by people who constantly deceive him as a matter of course, to include his allies, one of whom is also his love interest; adversaries and allies alike take advantage of his naivete and generally friendly nature. He is trustworthy, dependable and supportive of those he cares about, and he is forced to lie to, disappoint and even shame them in order to protect them.

He has a deep sense of personal responsibility and honor, but these can put him in even greater danger; however, this sense and his determination to do the right thing has the habit of inspiring those around him to act against their nature and do the right thing themselves. Carina Miller, who is a selfish agent, was moved enough by Chuck's refusal to leave Sarah to fend for herself that she agreed to help when her instinct was to take off and abandon Sarah. The same can be said for Roan Montgomery (admits cowardice), Craig and Laura Turner (turned traitor), and Stephen Bartowski (default reaction is to run).

He is portrayed as a romantic in a situation in which he can't have a real relationship: all potential girlfriends may have ulterior motives, his main love interest must maintain professional distance (in part to keep them safe), and people in the spy business are often used/manipulated.

Most of all, he has a desire to live a normal life, when circumstances (including his natural abilities) constantly put him in a position of unique responsibility to do the extraordinary.

To rise to the occasion, Chuck must rely on what strengths he has.

His affable and wholesome nature makes those around him protective of him. At Stanford, Bryce protects Chuck from a life that he thinks will destroy Chuck, though this does cause Chuck some pain. Sarah immediately gets the impression that Chuck is a good guy after they meet, which leads her to protect him rather than suspect him of being a villain, and breaks protocol repeatedly (even risking her career and freedom) to help Chuck. Casey has trouble bringing himself to kill Chuck, even on orders. Jill, a Fulcrum agent, has trouble betraying Chuck, and risks being recaptured to go back and tell Chuck where his father is being taken. Even Shaw, following being turned into a Ring Agent, protected Chuck's identity as the Intersect from the Ring.

Among his excellent problem-solving skills, Chuck is proficient in the use, identification, repair, and manipulation of a variety of electronics due to his experience in the Nerd Herd. These skills have come in handy many times, and his job as a member of the Nerd Herd has given him a good cover on missions. His job at the Buy More has, however, been a double-edged sword; he has been called away from the Buy More or away from his handlers by enemy agents (or, in Carina's case, agents who are not trusted) on a false 'computer emergency.'

At base, Chuck has inherited and developed a powerful intellect and has an impressive ability to solve puzzles. In ""Chuck Versus the Alma Mater"", Professor Fleming touts Chuck's ability to retain subliminal information, saying that his essay responses correlated to 98% of the exam, making him one of the top candidates for a CIA military project (and the ideal recipient of the Intersect).

His well-developed geek interests, from music to video games to learning the Klingon language, have managed to come in handy on several missions.  He has used a Tron movie poster and a comic book to hide his personal research from his handlers.

And last, although he tends to be visibly frightened in situations involving guns and danger, he has a deep reserve of courage, and almost always summons the nerve to risk his own life during a mission if he deems it necessary (such as if Sarah Walker's life is at risk). Even the fear itself comes in handy: Chuck takes advantage of his keen fear of needles by inciting a torturer to threaten him with a needle so that he faints.

In ""Chuck Versus First Class"", Shaw expresses the opinion that in some ways Casey and Sarah have held Chuck back in his development as a spy, due to his reliance on them to help him in difficult or dangerous situations. Both objected to Shaw sending Chuck out alone on a mission. Chuck was eager for an opportunity to get out from under his teammates' control and not have to ""stay in the car"".

""Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler"" demonstrates the degree to which Chuck's personality has changed over the course of the series. Devon notes the ease with which Chuck is now able to lie to his sister, and he ""burned"" his first asset by using the relationship and turning him over to the same protective custody he himself was once faced with. At the end of the episode, Chuck began drinking to cope with his actions. This change was further highlighted in ""Chuck Versus the Fake Name"", where he is increasingly disturbed by what he is becoming and telling Ellie he doesn't know who he is anymore.

In ""Chuck Versus the Honeymooners"", Morgan reveals that Chuck suffers from eczema (which Chuck admitted to having earlier in the series) and is an avid fan of DC Comics. In ""Chuck Versus Tom Sawyer"", it is revealed that Chuck is allergic to cats and Chuck admits to being allergic to all members of the polecat family (Whether this is true or said to avoid spending time at Jeff's residence is unknown).

In relation to non-spy life
Aside from its implications for his spy life, Chuck's personality is notable for the close relationships he develops with his family and best friend, its impact on his romantic life, and the position of leadership it earns him at the Buy More.

Chuck's loyalty and dependability to his best friend and his family have given him people he can always fall back on throughout the series, despite the strains introduced by his spy life as mentioned above. Casey is impressed by Chuck's loyalty to Morgan.

Chuck's good nature, humor, emotional supportiveness and obvious desire for a normal life have helped endear him to Sarah, who ultimately prefers Chuck to both Cole Barker and Bryce Larkin, both of whom are braver and better in combat than Chuck.  Their relationship continues to develop despite constant setbacks.  Chuck's personality is also a big factor in Lou's attraction to him.

Although he does not hold a management position at the Buy More, both the sales associates and Nerd Herd staff look to him for guidance and leadership.  Co-worker Anna Wu (Julia Ling) explained to a corporate efficiency expert that the store's chain of command is ""There's Chuck, then there's the rest of us.  Oh, and then there's Jeff"", and Lester Patel (Vik Sahay) reports that when unsure in a situation, asks himself, ""WWCD, what would Chuck do?""  When asked ""Who personifies the Buy More ideal? Who makes the trains run on time? Who provides your moral compass? Who holds the team together?"" the staff unanimously answers ""Chuck"". Even Big Mike holds Chuck in high regard, and has frequently turned to Chuck when he has things that need to be done and done right, and would have preferred him as Assistant Manager over Harry Tang. When Ned asks who is in charge at the Buy More, after he took the people their hostage, everyone, including Emmett and Big Mike, answer ""Chuck"". When Big Mike's new girlfriend revealed her son worked at the Buy More, Big Mike openly hoped that it was Chuck.

Evolution

Self-perception and initiative
Chuck became the Intersect unwittingly, and was essentially forced into a life in which he has no privacy and greatly reduced personal freedom, in which his relationships with his friends and family are strained, and in which he and those around him are in constant danger.  He did not initially respond positively to this, but cooperated one mission at a time, all the while insisting he was not a hero.  His perception of himself as less than heroic despite repeatedly saving the day seems to be based on his aversion to violence, low tolerance for pain, and lack of skill in combat.

For these reasons and because several missions have dragged him through old personal anxieties, he was initially reluctant to participate in missions.  By the middle of the second season, though, he began to look forward to missions and has even been disappointed when his handlers didn't have a new assignment for him.

However, this was contingent upon the fact that he still had the Intersect in his head.  Chuck frequently expressed a desire to return to a ""normal"" life, based partly on his understanding that having the Intersect in his head is a barrier to a real relationship with Sarah.   He was determined to remove the Intersect from his head once he began to believe it was a possibility, and pursued that possibility even at risk to himself.  Once the Intersect was removed, Chuck turned down an offer to become an analyst on the new Intersect project.

In ""Chuck Versus the Ring"", Chuck decides to help Sarah rescue Casey (who fortunately did not need to be rescued) and Bryce and prevents the Intersect from falling into the wrong hands and explains to his father that he is doing so because he loves Sarah.  He strongly insists on joining the mission to the Intersect room and argues that he is uniquely qualified to help.  When he finds Bryce dying and is suddenly faced with the choice of downloading the Intersect again or just destroying it, he reflects on the confidence that others have in him (that he is both good and capable) and his sense of duty to protect those close to him.  He downloads the Intersect, marking a shift from being a reluctant asset to being a willing agent.

In the aftermath, Chuck shows an unusual enthusiasm for becoming a different person as he gets the chance to train to be a spy.  He soon turns down an offer from Sarah to run away together, choosing instead to go through with the training.  Later, he explains that he made that choice because he has a unique ability to help a lot of people, including his friends, his family, and Sarah, and because he had learned from her to act for the greater good despite his personal feelings.

Chuck begins to challenge himself to prove he is a real spy.  In ""Chuck Versus First Class"", when Agent Shaw concludes that Chuck's handlers have been holding back his development as a spy, Chuck agrees, and welcomes the news that Shaw is assigning him to a solo mission.  And though he is clearly conflicted, he ""burns"" an asset, relegating that person to a life in an isolated facility instead of letting him escape; Chuck explains his decision by telling the asset, ""I'm not [your friend]; I'm a spy"".

Attitude toward violence
For most of the series, Chuck has been strongly pacifistic. He specifically told Sarah he dislikes guns and showed a preference of avoiding or preventing conflict.  He was deeply disturbed by Sarah's execution of Fulcrum agent Mauser.

However, when options necessitate the use of violence, Chuck is able to use means that could injure or kill. Later, during the events of ""Chuck Versus the Suburbs"", Fulcrum was attempting to refine their own version of the Intersect. The device was flawed, and except for Chuck, those subjected to the test were killed or driven insane. When Chuck saw Casey sneak up to the controls, although fully aware of what would happen to the Fulcrum agents who were in the test room, Chuck signaled Casey to activate the Intersect in order to prevent them from testing on Sarah. This incident was the first time that Chuck has willingly and personally taken a course of action where he knew that someone was going to be hurt or even killed as a result. In ""Chuck Versus the Colonel"", Chuck used a Dodge Challenger to deliberately run down a crowd of Fulcrum operatives who were holding Sarah prisoner.

Chuck handled a gun for the first time on an actual mission in ""Chuck Versus the Lethal Weapon;"" it did not go well as Chuck accidentally stumbles and drops the gun, shooting Perseus in the leg.  Despite his aversion to firearms established in this episode and earlier in ""Chuck Versus the Marlin"", Chuck points a gun at Casey so that he can get away to go on a rogue mission; Casey informs him that it is only a tranquilizer gun, and Chuck puts three darts into Casey.  Chuck later asked Sarah if he gets to have a gun for their rescue of his father in ""Chuck Versus the Colonel"".

At the beginning of Season 3 he is willing to personally harm others in combat (and take some pride in his ability to do so), though he still prefers to keep violence to a minimum and a preference to abstain from killing, or at the very least, being directly responsible for someone's death. Despite a long series of female adversaries, in ""Chuck Versus the Honeymooners"", Chuck still can't bring himself to hit a woman. In ""Chuck Versus First Class"", Chuck specifically reaffirmed his aversion to killing when packing for his first solo mission, having chosen nunchaku as a backup weapon in the event he needed to defend himself. Chuck was later ordered to kill a rogue CIA agent selling secrets to the Ring. Although he attempted to carry out the assignment he hesitated at the last moment and was only saved when the target attempted to draw his own weapon when Casey intervened and gunned him down first. Chuck was ultimately unable to avoid resorting to deadly force, and when Shaw attempted to kill Sarah, Chuck was forced to shoot him first.  Shaw survived the shot, and Chuck, given a second chance decided on arrest rather than vengeance; while Shaw said it made him weak, Sarah said it is what makes him great.

In Season Four, Chuck has still, to date, not been directly responsible for killing another person, and has been more successful finding a non-violent method to prevent catastrophe. He's prevented civil war and a nuclear strike by surrendering and acting as a mediator and marriage counselor between Generallisimo Goya and his wife, Hortencia. He also prevents his mother from using a gun to dispatch Volkoff's guards, tranqs them himself and informs Mary that he's going to have a talk about the benefits of tranq guns. When Alexei Volkoff tries to use Chuck's gun on him, Chuck informs him that he was never going to kill Alexei, a fact that was proven when Alexei pulls the trigger and Chuck reveals that he ""has this thing about bullets.""

Ironically, despite his dislike of guns and aversion to using lethal force, several episodes have suggested that Chuck is an excellent shot even without the aid of the Intersect. In particular, in ""Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler"" he was able to pick up and accurately fire a tranq gun at Manoosh from a substantial distance with almost no time spent aiming and no observable flash. In ""Chuck Versus the American Hero,"" he tranqs a Ring agent from approximately the same distance and comments ""No flash necessary."" Chuck's frequent explanation to his marksmanship has been Nintendo's Duck Hunt video game; however, upon learning of the Intersect, Morgan accuses Chuck of cheating when Chuck completes the round with a perfect score, stating 'You flashed on Duck Hunt.'

In the series finale, Chuck showed clear confusion when handling Casey's Desert Eagle without the Intersect and hesitated to kill Quinn even when he had a clear shot. Instead, Chuck decided to fire a warning shot and inadvertently shot down Casey's helicopter much to Chuck's shock and Casey's anger and frustration.

Competence
Josh Schwartz has stated that Chuck will continue to evolve and gain confidence in his new role.  Although inexperienced, Chuck's natural intelligence and observational skills have steadily been making him a more effective agent. Sarah has frequently encouraged him in this regard, and even Casey has made observations on Chuck's abilities. After Chuck removed the Intersect from his head, General Beckman invited Chuck to become an analyst, telling him he ""showed real promise"".

Chuck has become more proficient through the development of the Intersect, as well.  Stephen Bartowski teaches Chuck how to perform a superhuman feat of computation using the Intersect in ""Chuck Versus the Dream Job"".  In ""Chuck Versus the First Kill"", Chuck is able to flash on multiple subjects at the same time.  And the enhanced Intersect 2.0 grants Chuck physical abilities: his first flash teaches him kung fu, marking the first time Chuck has excelled in any kind of combat.

In the third season, Chuck has already shown that he is beginning to overcome some of his fears.  Despite his previous fear of heights, he has now arrived at home wearing a harness from being dropped off by a helicopter, and he has used a zip-line.  He is also noticeably less squeamish around blood in ""Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte"" than he was in previous seasons. In Chuck versus the Tooth, while he is still phobic of needles, Chuck no longer faints.

By Season 4 Chuck has proven himself to be a fully capable agent, even without the aid of the Intersect (although he still uses flashes for assistance in combat, and for other skills Sarah and Casey have picked up over years of training). His success as an agent ultimately leads to the President making Chuck's reinstatement a priority and Beckman forcing Chuck back into CIA service. In ""Chuck Versus the Suitcase"", Chuck shows Q-like capability when he develops his tranq gloves. In ""Chuck Versus the Coup d'Etat"", Ellie remarks that she had never seen Chuck look as alive as he did when drawing on the Intersect to help her, Devon, Sarah, and Generalissimo Goya escape a coup in Costa Gravas. Chuck also planned an elaborate trap to lure Casey's old team out of hiding in ""Chuck Versus the Couch Lock"" as part of his attempts to locate his mother, although it is left unclear how much of the plan was influenced by Casey and Sarah (though, as the original thought was Chuck's, it's very likely that Sarah's and Casey's involvements were minor.) In ""Chuck versus Phase Three"", General Beckman assures the team that Chuck, even without the Intersect, has a place as a spy.

Chuck's remarkable ability and natural aptitude with the Intersect has caused many members of the military and spy community to resent him; the most notable to date has been Director Jane Bentley, who briefly became the Project Leader and used Chuck's laptop to create Intersect Agents in ""Chuck Versus the A-Team"". After a major debacle caused by one of Bentley's ""trigger-happy"" agents, Bentley was removed as Project Leader, and Beckman charged Chuck with the task of finding his replacement, essentially promoting him to Project Leader. Season five introduced Nicholas Quinn, who reveals to have been the original agent chosen for the Intersect project before the computer was destroyed by Bryce Larkin. Quinn, having been renegated by the CIA after this, makes it his personal mission to acquire the Intersect he had been promised and kill Chuck for ""stealing"" the career he was supposed to have.

By the fifth season, Chuck no longer works for the CIA, but remains in the spy life by launching a freelance espionage and security company, Carmichael Industries. Though he is without the Intersect, his aptitude, intelligence and technological abilities allow him to lead the former members of Operation Bartowski as a mastermind. It is revealed that he was known as the ""Piranha"" and the movie ""The Swordfish"" was made about his legendary hacking skills. He uses a fine Chardonnay, his ""thinking juice,"" to pull off his ""The Routine"" of his l33t skillz which he uses to find and track down ""Colin David of MIT."" He gets really giddy when he's in ""The Routine."" Though he has been retired for a while, Chuck still bests a terrorist's lead hacker in a ""hack-off,"" where he circumvents the cell's security, steals the Omen virus, and orders bigscreen TVs for the organization while his opponent steals one cent from the National Treasury (with Chuck's help.) He also shows respectable hand-to-hand combat abilities without the intersect, going toe-to-toe with the likes of Daniel Shaw (without the intersect) and Nicholas Quinn, as well as being able to dispatch random henchman and even block a series of attacks from an Intersect-enhanced Morgan.

Personal, professional, romantic
Chuck has developed in other ways since the series started.  At the beginning, he is socially awkward to the point of driving away women, in large part because he is unable to get over his betrayals at Stanford.  He is stuck in a bad job, unsure if he even wants to advance within the company, and lacks confidence that he can do better.

Since then, he has developed romantically with Sarah despite constant setbacks, he has (with the help of the government) attained his degree from Stanford and is able to successfully get a job at a top technology company (although for a mission), and is determined to take control of his life.

In the third season, Chuck has embraced his destiny to become a spy, and turns down Sarah's offer to run away together, though he still loves her.  He also more than once expresses an interest in getting a better cover job.

At the end of ""Chuck Versus the Other Guy"", Chuck and Sarah become a couple. He has also proposed that they would be together in 30 years. In Chuck Versus the Suitcase while conversing with Sarah, Chuck has hinted that they were ""next"" after Devon and Ellie to get married and have children. This initially horrified Sarah, but she has since confirmed that she would marry him if he proposed. In ""Chuck Versus Phase Three"" it has been revealed to everybody that Chuck has an extravagant proposal plan, which he has since revised. In ""Chuck Versus the Push Mix"" Chuck proposes to Sarah, and she accepts. By ""Chuck Versus the Seduction Impossible"", the couple are already planning their wedding. And on Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger, the couple married and bought the Buy More, from all of the Volkoff Industries' assets, courtesy of Hartley Winterbottom; AKA the former Alexei Volkoff.

By the end of the series, Chuck was shown to be in much greater control of his emotions, having developed enough emotional maturity and control to allow him to use the Intersect on cue even during the events of the final episode, during which his emotions were clearly and greatly compromised.

828,20431226,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu%20Yulu,Wu Yulu,"Wu Yulu is a Chinese farmer and inventor of home-made robots. He has become widely known for his fanciful creations made from scrap metal and other materials. He lives in Mawu Village, near Beijing.

Career
He started making robots at about 11 years of age. With a different upbringing or education perhaps, Wu might have become an engineer. But his teachers were no good when he was school-aged, he said, so he stopped going. He learned to make robots by making mistakes.

In the late 1970s, Wu got a job at a farm machinery factory, and the small income helped him turn used sewing machine parts and some steel wire into his first robot. ""Until now, I don't know the theory of physics, but I knew that electricity can drive motors and power can be transferred to the robot's hands and legs with levers and wires,"" Wu said. After his first robot turned out to be ""disabled,"" Wu continued to experiment. In 1982, the first movable robot, Wu Laoda (the first son of the Wu), was born.

Robots

Wu's robots' given names indicate the order they are created, and they are all given his own family name (Wu). His most famous robot is named Wu .  He has built robots capable of climbing walls, serving water, lighting cigarettes, playing musical instruments and writing calligraphy.

""I can invent robots able to carry a sedan chair, and next I will make robots of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. ""There are so many good things in life, and they become the basis for my robots"".

On the strength of his early novels in the 1940s, Gilbert was accounted by E. M. Forster as ""a writer of distinction"", but he is chiefly remembered as the author of Ratman's Notebooks (1968) which sold over 1 million copies and was twice made into a horror film named Willard (1971 and 2003) in the United States.

Early life
Stephen Gilbert was born in Newcastle, County Down in 1912 into a prosperous Irish Protestant mercantile family and grew up mainly in an affluent district of Belfast East. Like his near-contemporaries C. S. Lewis and Louis MacNeice, the young Gilbert was sent ""across the water"" to school. From age 10 he attended The Leas, Hoylake on Merseyside in England and from age 13 Loretto School, Musselburgh in Scotland. He returned from Musselburgh without a Leaving Certificate, but not before manifesting his budding literary talent. Gilbert, occasionally helped by school friends, produced The Broadcaster, a handwritten and illustrated digest of stories, news and essays which he would post to relatives back home.

In Belfast, he worked briefly as a court reporter for the Northern Whig (a witness to magistrates imposing fines on failed suicides; Gilbert in later years volunteered with the Samaritans). From the mid-1930s, he was working full time in his father's tea and seed business, Samuel McCausland Ltd.

Friendship with Forrest Reid
In 1931, just before his 19th birthday, Gilbert met the novelist Forrest Reid, then in his mid-50s. Reid's many novels reflect his fascination with teenage boys and he was drawn to Gilbert. The two commenced a turbulent friendship that lasted until Reid's death in 1947. Reid acted as a mentor to Gilbert and depicts an idealised version of their relationship (opening with a holiday encounter in the seaside town of Ballycastle) in his novel Brian Westby (1944). The relationship appeared platonic, but Gilbert found Reid's demands, and interference in his affairs, excessive.

Gilbert's later novel, The Burnaby Experiments (1952), appearing five years after Reid's death, has been read as ""a thinly disguised portrayal of their relationship from Gilbert's point of view and a belated response to Brian Westby"".

First novels
Gilbert's first novel, The Landslide (1943), a fantasy involving prehistoric creatures uncovered in a landslide in a remote part of Ireland, was dedicated to Reid. The creatures are benevolent, but upset the order of things. It was released to positive reviews, including one from E. M. Forster (a friend of Reid's) speaking on the BBC. A second novel, Bombardier, appeared the following year. It is based on his volunteer wartime experiences with the 3rd (Ulster) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery in France, including the evacuation at Dunkirk (Gilbert was awarded the Military Medal for burning a bridge in the face of an enemy advance). Bombardier was a moderate financial success, going through at least two printings.

According to Andrew Doyle's introduction to the 2014 reprint of Monkeyface (1948), that book and The Burnaby Experiments (1952) were both well received by critics, but neither was a financial or popular success. Monkeyface told the story of an ape-man missing link who is brought from the jungles of South America to the U.K. and learns to speak English, but struggles with adapting to modern human society. Burnaby follows a young man's strange experiences with an eccentric uncle's research into the possibility of the survival of the human soul after death.

Post-war family and political engagement
While in service during World War II, Gilbert corresponded with his fiancé Kathleen Stevenson, a distant relative, who had joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). She was stationed in North Africa where she was twice mentioned in dispatches. The two were married in Belfast in 1945 and set up home at Gilnahirk, on the eastern edge of the city, with Gilbert dividing his time between the family business, to which he returned, and writing. The couple had four children.

By 1960, Gilbert felt that he might ""be finished as a writer"". He found new engagement in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He founded the CND's Northern Ireland branch, served as its secretary and helped organize marches and demonstrations. ""What was the good of all the writers, all human achievement"", he asked, ""if there was going to be no audience?"". The possibility of misused science rending all art and civilization apart can be seen as a connecting theme for some of his more fantastical plot twists, not all of which persuaded publishers.

Ratman's Notebooks
In 1968 Gilbert did have an unexpected success with Ratman's Notebooks, the last work published in his lifetime. The story of an emotionally deadened, but embittered, youth who trains rats to attack and kill his enemies, it was filmed twice in the United States as Willard. The first film adaptation, directed by Daniel Mann and starring Bruce Davison, Ernest Borgnine, Sondra Locke and Elsa Lanchester, was released in 1971, opening to good reviews and high box office returns. It was followed in 1972 by an original film sequel called Ben.

The original film was remade in 2003, directed by Glen Morgan and starring Crispin Glover, R. Lee Ermey and Laura Elena Harring. More loosely based on Gilbert's original work, it was also a relative box office success.

The Bloody City
Stephen Gilbert died at a nursing home at Whitehead, north of Carrickfergus, County Antrim on 23 June 2010 at age 97.

In 2015, five years after Gilbert's death, Valancourt Books, an independent American publishing house dedicated to ""the rediscovery of rare, neglected, and out-of-print fiction,"" published a limited edition of an unfinished novel. Edited and compiled by the playwright and comedian Andrew Doyle, it draws on manuscripts in the possession of the author's son, Tom Gilbert, and of Queen's University, Belfast.

The Bloody City is a realist novel, that takes the reader through the first year of the Northern Ireland Troubles: it begins in the final months of 1968 as the Northern Ireland civil rights movement takes to the streets and ends after the August 1969 riots. The protagonist is, to a degree, autobiographical. Like Gilbert, ""Frank Downton"" is a son attempting to work with his father in a family business that, in many respects, is a stolid representation of the city's dissolving Victorian and Unionist order. Downton is caught up in the street violence and in the sectarian, class and sexual tensions of the workplace.

Gilbert personally was close to some of the action described, or alluded to, in the novel. While writing the novel, he was living on Colin Road in predominately Catholic-Nationalist Belfast West, ""an unlikely, indeed hazardous, habitation"", local writer and critic Patricia Craig noted in her obituary for Gilbert, for ""a middle-class Belfast Presbyterian who sounded like an Englishman"". His place of business, Samuel McCausland Ltd, suffered damage from fire bombs, blast bombs and a car bomb to which Gilbert attributed an employee's fatal heart attack.

Stephen Gilbert papers
The Stephen Gilbert Collection at Queens University, Belfast includes correspondence with authors Walter de la Mare, George Buchanan, Forrest Reid and E. M. Forster. In addition to a draft for The Bloody City, the collection also holds a completed manuscript for another unpublished novel, Dear Granny and Sweet Child (or Granny Carson’s Sex Fantasy).

Its name comes from the sandy nature that this east bank of the river once used to have.  El Arenal has a history characterised by its former position as the port of Seville, until river silting forced the city to relocate the port to the southern edge of the city in the 17th century.

In the 16th century, the district called El Compás de Arenal, El Compás, or El Arenal was smaller than that of today and lay between the city walls and the river between the Puerta del Arenal, and the Puerta del Triana gates. A low-lying, sandy area, it was the main home of the Sevillan underworld, and the site of the notorious brothel, El Compás from where the other part of its name derived.

835,54414749,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bury%20the%20Chains,Bury the Chains,"Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves is a non-fiction book by Adam Hochschild that was first published by Houghton Mifflin on January 7, 2005. The book is a narrative history of the late 18th- and early 19th-century anti-slavery movement in the British Empire. The story centers around a group of British abolitionist campaigners and traces their campaign from its beginnings with Somerset v Stewart in 1772 until full emancipation for all British slaves was legally granted in 1838. The book looks at the setbacks the abolitionists faced as well as the campaign tactics they used, and explains how they were ultimately able to end the practice of slavery in Britain.

The book came about from Hochschild's initial idea to write a biography on John Newton, a slave trader turned abolitionist. Further research into Newton's life drew Hochschild into the abolitionist movement as a whole instead and introduced him to English abolitionist Thomas Clarkson. Clarkson, whose often overlooked contributions Hochschild wanted to highlight, serves as the book's central figure.

Bury the Chains was generally well-received by critics. Its narrative was praised for being compelling and uplifting, while a few reviewers felt it lacked depth and that Hochschild's political leanings clouded his writing. The book won several literary awards, including the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for History and the 2006 Lionel Gelber Prize. According to The New Republic, the book has inspired modern-day climate change activists who see parallels between the antislavery and climate change campaigns.

Background and development

Adam Hochschild is an American author and co-founder of the progressive American magazine Mother Jones. Much of his writing focuses on historical social injustices and the individuals who campaigned to end them. Hochschild said of the overarching theme in his work: ""To me there's nothing more interesting than trying to evoke moments when men and women risked their lives to battle horrendous injustice [...] It's hard for me to imagine spending four or five years working on a book if there isn't some pressing moral issue at the core of the story."" A popular historian, Hochschild has stated that his intention is not to provide new analyses of historical events with his books, but rather ""to bring a period of time alive by focusing on 10 or 12 people who lived through it, and whose lives intersected in some way."" Hochschild's other books include the acclaimed King Leopold's Ghost, an account of the colonial atrocities committed in the Belgian Congo; The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin, an account of the effects of Joseph Stalin's dictatorship on contemporary Russians; and Spain in Our Hearts, an account of the American volunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War.

Bury the Chains came about from Hochschild's initial idea to write a biography on John Newton, known for writing the hymn ""Amazing Grace"". Newton's personal transformation from a slave trader to an abolitionist had long intrigued him. However, a few months into researching Newton's life, Hochschild came to the realization that ""the story was the movement and not Newton."" His research into Newton's life also introduced Hochschild to abolitionist campaigner Thomas Clarkson, who became the central figure in Bury the Chains. Hochschild observed that Clarkson's contributions to the abolitionist campaign was often overlooked in favor of William Wilberforce's. According to him, Clarkson was ""by far the more interesting figure"" who ""really got shortchanged by history,"" and Hochschild wanted to correct this. Hochschild was also drawn to write about the British antislavery movement upon learning that many of the methods used by modern-day advocacy groups were pioneered by the British abolitionists, including boycotts, political book tours, direct mail fundraising, newsletters, petitions, campaign posters and buttons, and the concept of setting up national organizations with local branches around the country.

Having known little about the subject when he started working on this book, it took Hochschild four years of research and writing to complete it. He conducted a lot of his research for the book in libraries, particularly the University of California, Berkeley Libraries and the Stanford University Libraries. Hochschild's research also took him to England and western Jamaica to visit places where events in the book occurred. In England, he visited 2 George Yard in London, the address of the bookstore where the abolitionists held their meetings, now the location of a modern skyscraper. In Jamaica, Hochschild visited the area where the slave rebellions took place so as to search for the remains of old sugar plantations.

Title
The book's title came from a story of a group of slaves in the town of Falmouth, Jamaica, who immediately following the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire on August 1, 1838, placed their slave whip and chains in a coffin and buried the coffin in a Baptist churchyard.

Content

Bury the Chains is a narrative history of the antislavery movement in the United Kingdom. It follows a group of British abolitionist activists and chronicles their successful campaign to end slavery in the British Empire. The group includes Granville Sharp, an unconventional civil libertarian; Thomas Clarkson, a University of Cambridge graduate who dedicated his life to the antislavery campaign; John Newton, a former slave ship captain turned Evangelical preacher; William Wilberforce, an English politician and close friend of British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger; and Olaudah Equiano, a former slave who bought his freedom and became an abolitionist writer.

The book starts out with an overview of slavery and the slave trade in 18th-century Britain. Hochschild then details the start of the antislavery campaign in England, from Granville Sharp's advocacy of African slave James Somerset in Somerset v Stewart in 1772 to the establishment of Granville Town, Province of Freedom in 1787. After that, English abolitionist Thomas Clarkson serves as the book's central figure. Hochschild recounts how as a student at the University of Cambridge, Clarkson became so appalled by the slave trade while researching the topic for his prize-winning antislavery essay that he dedicated the rest of his life to the antislavery movement. Clarkson later found allies for his cause in the Quakers, one of whom, bookstore and printing shop owner James Phillips, agreed to publish his antislavery essay. The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was thus formed in May 1787 with both Clarkson and Sharp as founding members, holding meetings in Phillips's bookstore.

Hochschild covers ""the bleak decade"" from 1792 to 1802, when the needs of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Haitian Revolution initially set the antislavery campaign back. Even then, the campaign continued to gain ground thanks to an effective boycott of slave-produced sugar, and the advocacy of men such as army officer George Pinckard and painter William Blake. Hochschild acknowledges the crucial role of women's societies and women activists such as Elizabeth Heyrick. These societies circulated antislavery publications and petitions, raised funds for the campaign, spoke out against slavery at public meetings, and led the sugar boycott, refusing to patronize bakers and shopkeepers who used and sold slave-produced sugar.

Hochschild explains how the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act 1807 came about not just through activism alone, but also as a result of national rhetoric and economic warfare against France who had renewed slavery under Napoleon. Hochschild explains that the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which banned slavery in Britain and its colonies, only became possible thanks to the Reform Act 1832 which saw many long-held seats in the House of Commons replaced. Hochschild notes that the Abolition Act upset many abolitionists as it provided compensation for slave-owners. The Abolition Act took legal effect on August 1, 1838, granting full emancipation for all British slaves.

Reception

Critical response

Bury the Chains received many positive reviews for its compelling and witty narrative, which according to The Daily Telegraphs Max Hastings, ""never fails to hold the reader's attention."" While most reviewers enjoyed Hochschild's ""vivid"" writing, the Chicago Reader called it ""ingratiating"" and the Journal of Social History felt it sometimes ""descends into silliness"".

Hochschild does not gloss over the brutalities of slavery which can make the book difficult to read. Despite its dark subject matter, some reviewers commended Hochschild's account for being an ultimately ""inspiring"" one, focused on the courage of the abolitionists and celebrating their achievements.  On the other hand, the Chicago Reader observed that in its attempt to be ""uplifting"", the book intentionally glosses over some of the less appealing implications of the abolitionist campaign. Publishers Weekly disagreed, giving Hochschild credit for highlighting the abolitionists' own shortcomings and mistakes.

Among the few lukewarm reviews, the Chicago Reader was critical of what they perceived to be Hochschild's liberal beliefs clouding his objectivity as well as his dismissive attitude towards Christianity, particularly toward John Newton, who continued to captain slave ships after his conversion to Christianity. Academic journals were also not as receptive to the book. Reviewers in the Journal of Social History and the Journal of British Studies felt that Hochschild's anecdotal approach limits the book's ability to explain issues with greater depth. While the former still considered the book ""a brilliant distillation of the most recent generation of scholarly research,"" the latter felt that even as a work of popular history, Bury the Chains could have been ""more nuanced and sophisticated"".

Reviewers agreed that Hochschild's intent in writing Bury the Chains was to use the successful British abolitionist movement to inspire contemporary activists and provide them with a model from which to emulate. The New York Times'''s Marilynne Robinson felt his intent was an ""honorable one"", while NPR's Maureen Corrigan selected the book as one of her favorites of 2005 and commended it for advancing the work of the abolitionists in ""lifting our moral blindness.""

AccoladesBury the Chains won the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for History, the Gold Medal for Nonfiction at the 2005 California Book Awards, the 2006 PEN Center USA Literary Award in the Research Nonfiction category, and the 2006 Lionel Gelber Prize. The book was also a finalist for the 2005 National Book Award for Nonfiction and long-listed for the 2005 Samuel Johnson Prize (now the Baillie Gifford Prize).

Climate change activists
According to The New Republic, the book has inspired modern-day climate change activists who see historical analogies between the antislavery and climate change movements. Andrew Hoffman, a scholar of environmental issues, asserted that the climate change campaign requires a drastic and collective change in the public's beliefs to be successful, similar to the challenge and moral dilemma faced by the abolitionists as described in Hochschild's account. A reviewer for the journal Climatic Change wrote that Hochschild's book can give ""perspective and inspiration for today's activist.""

Hochschild has been very pleased by the interest Bury the Chains'' has received from environmental groups, noting that it is crucial for contemporary activists to learn about past movements that were successful. He suggests that the main lessons climate change activists can learn from the British abolitionists are the importance of building coalitions of people from diverse backgrounds and beliefs, and the need for effective campaign messaging.

836,47868316,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phellodon%20melaleucus,Phellodon melaleucus,"Phellodon melaleucus, commonly known as the grey tooth, is a species of tooth fungus in the family Bankeraceae. It was originally described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815 as a species of Hydnum. In 1881, Petter Karsten included it as one of the original three species in his newly circumscribed genus Phellodon. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe and North America, where it associates mycorrhizally with a wide range of host trees. It is considered vulnerable in Switzerland.

Description
The grey tooth is a small to medium-sized fungus with a leathery or corky fruiting body. On the underside it has pale grayish-brown spines from which spores are released rather  than from gills. It may look like a convoluted single fruiting body but in fact each part has a blackish stem, and several caps can fuse together. The cap tends to be concentrically zoned with a reddish-brown to blackish-brown centre and a pale edge. The flesh is greyish-brown, darker near the base of the stem, and smells of fenugreek.

Distribution and habitat
This species occurs in various parts of Europe and has been recorded in North America. It is uncommon in the United Kingdom and very rare in Ireland. This is an ectomycorrhizal species that forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of various plants, usually trees; the hyphae of the fungus wrap round the rootlets of the host tree, and there is an exchange of nutrients between the two. It is typically found growing on the ground on mossy banks in the vicinity of its hosts. In the British Isles it is associated with various trees including oak, beech, sweet chestnut, birch, Scots pine and spruce.

837,6756773,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Hope%20Conspiracy,The Hope Conspiracy,"The Hope Conspiracy is an American hardcore punk band from Boston, Massachusetts, United States, formed in late 1999. They were picked up by Equal Vision Records and Bridge 9 Records before signing a deal with Deathwish Records.

Biography
With the help of Mark Thompson of Tortuga and Hydra Head Records, The Hope Conspiracy headed to Godcity Studios in Norwood, Massachusetts to record their first demo in November 1999. It consisted of three songs (""Escapist"", ""Divinity Sickness"", and ""When the Doves Fly""). They produced 1000 copies of the tape, and managed to present 200 copies at their first show with black and white covers (which were quickly made on the way to the gig). Then they produced 800 more color copies of the demo cover based on a design by Aaron Turner. In early 2000, Turner brought up the idea of the demo cassette being put on CD and 7"" vinyl, and the band accepted the invitation. The CD version contained one extra song, ""It Meant Nothing"". In both demos, the song ""When the Doves Fly"" was renamed to ""Regret Kills"". This demo is now out of print.

In July 2000, The Hope Conspiracy set out recording their debut full-length entitled Cold Blue on Equal Vision Records. The 10-song album was recorded in a week in both Godcity Studios and The Outpost in Stoughton, Massachusetts. It was released on October 24, 2000. In the next two years the band toured off of this album, contributed a cover of ""Nervous Breakdown"" to the Back on Black 7"" Black Flag tribute on Initial Records, and released an EP called File 03 on Bridge 9 Records. File 03 was a rerelease of their original demo tracks plus two new tracks (one song of original material called ""No Love Goes Unpunished"" and a cover of Naked Raygun's ""Treason""). The European version of ""File 03"" is available from Join the Team Player Records.

When it came time to record their second full-length, the band had gone through what they called ""a long overdue lineup solidification."" The album, entitled Endnote, was recorded during May and June 2002 in Brooklyn, New York's Atomic Studios. The 12-song album was produced by Dean Baltunosis and was released on October 17, 2002. In November 2002, Deathwish Records released a limited split 7"" with The Suicide File with a song called ""Failure"", which was an outtake from earlier recording sessions.

The band went on a hiatus in 2004. In that time, Kevin Baker did vocals for Bars, while Jared Shavelson played drums for None More Black.

Their third album, Death Knows Your Name, was released on September 19, 2006 on Deathwish Records. The album has received favorable reviews. As a teaser, the record label released the Hang Your Cross EP in July 2006.

With high anticipation surrounding new material (recorded by Kurt Ballou at God City Studios) ""True Nihilist EP 7"""" was released in 2009 on Deathwish Inc.

As a result of the construction of the power plant, a dam lake was created on the Vistula (Włocławek Reservoir). Initially it was supposed to be an element of the cascade of the lower Vistula, but the other dams were never built.

History 
The barrage was built in the years 1962-1970. At the beginning, the Włocławek power plant was managed by the Northern District Power Plant Complex in Straszyn. In 1973 the Włocławek Hydroelectric Power Plant District was established. It was dissolved in 1976 and its management transferred directly to the Toruń Power Plant. On 1 March 1998, a private limited company called “Hydroelectric Power Plant in Włocławek” was established, which formally existed until 12 March 2013. After years of numerous transformations of Energa Group companies, the company responsible for the Włocławek power plant is now Energa Wytwarzanie SA.

Technical specifications 
River: Vistula

Location: 674,850 km

Year of construction: 1970

Piling: 57.30 m above sea level.

Slope: 8.80 m

Number of hydrosets: 6

Turbine type: Kaplan turbine

Installed power: 160.2 MW

Installed gulp: 2190 m3/sec

Average production: 739 GWh/a

Technical difficulties 
After the construction of the water barrage and the entire power plant in 1970, the dam was planned to operate for 10-15 years. During this time, in the lower part of the Vistula River, another dams (hydroelectric power plants) were to be built. Due to economic problems there were no funds to build the remaining power plants. The dam, despite its deteriorating technical condition, still continues to operate.

It was only in the early 1990s that attention was drawn to the problem of the dam. First reports issued at that time said that the structure could tip over, causing a serious disaster. In order to prevent the dam from collapsing, it was planned to build a hydroelectric power plant in Nieszawa, which would relieve the burden of the outdated structure. In 2012, the proposal for this location was withdrawn, and it was finally decided that an additional dam (power plant) would be built in Siarzewo, on the 708th kilometer of the Vistula river.

In 2015, after 3 years of work, at a cost of over 115 million PLN, the reconstruction and renovation of the Włocławek dam was completed. However, this has not solved the problem of the erosion of the riverbed further down the Vistula - the construction of an additional barrage in Siarzewo has not yet started, and it is now assumed that work may start in 2020, if all the necessary administrative decisions can be obtained earlier (the project to build the new barrage is not supported by all the scientists).

Environmental impact of the power plant 
The reservoir was built on the area of the former natural river system, which can still be found on the Vistula between Wyszogród and Płock. Flooding of this part of the river caused the loss of many valuable habitats of plants and animals residing in this type of environment.

One of the many effects of the construction was the fact that it made almost impossible for anadromous fish to wander up the Vistula river basin. During the last reconstruction of the dam the fish pass was rebuilt. According to the person responsible for its functioning, the fish pass works much better than the old structure, and the computer system scans, monitors, and registers all flowing fish, collecting data on their quantity and species. In addition to the negative effects of the construction of the power plant, positive environmental changes should also be noted in the areas surrounding the dam. Water damming has improved the water supply in areas with low precipitation. It is commonly assumed that the energy coming from the dam is clean in the sense of no emission of poisonous or greenhouse gases.

However, according to some activists fighting for environmental protection (including Adam Wajrak), the dam is far from being ecological. Some also argue that in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the existence of the hydroelectric power plant in Włocławek has a significant impact on the environment - due to the significant amount of organic matter in the reservoir, it emits about 400 mg/m² of methane per day.

Rebuilding of the fish pass 
In 1970, a year after the completion of the dam, a fish pass with a flow of 0.935 m3/s was launched, consisting of 33 chambers. The research carried out in the years 1971-1974 showed that fish can overcome the barrage, but the number of sea trout using the fish pass is disproportionately small in relation to the size of the stock. Over time, the conditions of the fish pass worsened. During the first two years from its launch, deep erosion of the channel caused the bed to drop by 2.5 m. The situation was to be improved by a stone threshold, which was built at the entrance to the fish pass to stop the erosion. However, on the basis of research carried out in the years 1998-2004, it turned out that this solution worsened the location of the entrance to the pass. As a result, only 3.5% of the fish entering the pass could swim through the whole structure.

In 2014, the pass was rebuilt and, according to reports, the migration of sea trout and vimba improved. The new fish pass consists of 60 chambers, a flow rate of 0.59 m3/s and a slope between chambers equal to 0.22 m (for comparison, the slope in the old pass was 0.4 m).

Fish surveillance 
Monitoring devices were installed to monitor fish migration. One of them is the Riverwatcher fish counter installed in the 49th chamber, made of two plates arranged parallel to each other. They emit or receive infrared light beams. The fish passing between the plates crosses the light beams, hence its shape is known. The meter is also equipped with a camera. The second monitoring device is a fish trap installed in chamber 60. The fish pass is additionally equipped with a pipeline attracting fish to the trap.

Essentials for the proper functioning of the fish pass:

 constant verification of water level in water level gauges;
 control of water inlet points;
 control of water inlet to the baiting pipeline;

 control of structural elements inside the pass.

847,14432100,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance%20Corps,Reconnaissance Corps,"The Reconnaissance Corps, or simply Recce Corps, was a corps of the British Army, formed during the Second World War whose units provided reconnaissance for infantry divisions. It was formed from infantry brigade reconnaissance groups on 14 January 1941.

All the brigade reconnaissance groups of each infantry corps were formed into reconnaissance battalions, each usually bearing the number of its relevant division. For example, the 43rd Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps (based on the 5th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment) was the divisional reconnaissance battalion of the 43rd (Wessex) Division.

Initially, coming from infantry units, reconnaissance units used the infantry designations of battalions, companies and platoons. However, from 6 June 1942, the Corps changed to the cavalry descriptions of regiments, squadrons and troops.

The Corps became part of the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) in 1944, still maintaining its own cap badge with two lightning strikes supporting an upright spear. With the end of the war, this number of reconnaissance units was not needed and the Reconnaissance Corps was disbanded in August 1946. Reconnaissance duties reverted to regular armoured units of the RAC.

Organisation and equipment

The Reconnaissance Corps was charged with gathering vital tactical information in battle for infantry divisions, probing ahead and screening the flanks of main advances. The training centre was established at Winchester in February 1941, until the home of the Corps moved to Catterick in Yorkshire. Although the Corps was raised from various regular army units, it did not follow that all men would be retained, as potential reconnoiterers were required to take an IQ test and other tests before being accepted. Many failed and were sent to normal infantry battalions, but those who succeeded enjoyed the kudos of belonging to an elite unit and were determined to prove their own worth. Before beginning training with his unit, each man undertook a five-week course with technical units, which determined his role as a driver, wireless operator or mechanic. Most recce men became efficient in two of these roles e.g. driver and operator. During training with a reconnaissance unit, emphasis was placed on both aggressiveness and initiative, as these were the characteristics expected of the men selected for such units, and, as a result, a proud offensive spirit was created, similar to other newly founded units such as The Parachute Regiment. Reconnaissance regiments were organised into a headquarters squadron (including anti-tank, signals and mortar troops) and three reconnaissance (or ""recce"") squadrons. Each recce squadron comprised three scout troops and an assault troop. Scout troops were equipped with Bren Gun Carriers and light reconnaissance cars, such as the Humber Light Reconnaissance Car. The assault troops were composed of lorried infantry and were called up when enemy resistance needed to be overcome. Later in the war, more efficient and well-armed armoured cars such as the Humber Armoured Car, Daimler Armoured Car, Staghound and Greyhound augmented the light reconnaissance cars in scout troops.

Campuses 

São Judas Tadeu University, or São Judas as it commonly referred to, has two campuses in the city of São Paulo: the main one, located in the district of Mooca is a five-building complex containing 174 classrooms, 128 laboratories, a large library, 2 large lecture theatres and a theatre. It has easy access to Bresser-Mooca and Belém São Paulo metro stations.

The university's campus in Butantã is a modern, recently inaugurated single building located minutes from the Butantã metro station. As of now, it does not offer as many course options as the main campus in Mooca, although over the time there are projections of an increase in the number of students and consequently, courses offered.

Courses 

The university offers a wide range of undergraduate courses and at least forty post-graduate courses and five master's degrees in several fields of study.

History
Patrick James Leahy launched the Johnstone River Advocate on 6 December 1906. On Leahy's death in 1927 the newspaper was purchased by William Henry George Groom.

It was originally published as a weekly newspaper; Groom moved to a bi-weekly schedule in January 1929. From November 1940, the newspaper was published daily and in May 1941 was renamed the Evening Advocate.

In 1973 a massive increase in the cost of telex messages used to circulate syndicated news made the newspaper financially unviable and Groom threatened to close the newspaper in September 1973. However he was persuaded to continue to publish the newspaper and from October 1973 it was published only three times a week without telexed news content. Groom retired in January 1978, selling the newspaper.

In 2015, the newspaper continues to be published bi-weekly as the Innisfail Advocate by Newscorp.

Along with a number of other regional Australian newspapers owned by NewsCorp, the newspaper ceased publication in June 2020. It was deemed ""unprofitable"" by Newscorp.

The Innisfail Advocate will be now covered by the Cairns Post.

History

WGNS was initially started by Gray Matter's Geoff Turner in Maryland in the early 1980s as a cassette label. WGNS stood for ""We Gots No Station."" Initial recordings were mastered to a cassette and then dubbed from the master to cassettes which were numbered and sold. The releases typically included a ziploc bag containing artwork and lyric sheets. As time went on, Turner built WGNS Studios as a basement recording studio for local musicians. The studio moved many times, with locations in Maryland, Washington, DC, and Virginia.  

In 1984 the first vinyl release, the Bloody Mannequin Orchestra's Roadmap to Revolution LP, a 12"" 33⅓ rpm record was released.

WGNS was responsible for the rise of great artists such as Ennui and Dave Grohl. In the summer of 1991, Scream drummer Grohl  went into WGNS Studios and recorded four songs, playing all the instruments himself. A tape of the songs, given by Grohl to Simple Machines co-founder Jenny Toomey, became a candidate for the label's Tool Cassette Series. Simple Machines released the songs on the Pocketwatch (album) using Grohl's pseudonym Late! in summer 1992. In May 1992, Ennui recorded at the WGNS studio located in Arlington, Virginia. Grohl recorded again at WGNS Studios in 1996, when it was back in Washington, DC.

856,18021226,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter%20Frere,Walter Frere,"Walter Howard Frere  (23 November 1863 – 2 April 1938) was a co-founder of the Anglican religious order the Community of the Resurrection, Mirfield, and Bishop of Truro (1923–1935).

Biography
Frere was born in Cambridge, England, on 23 November 1863, the younger son of Philip Howard Frere and his wife Emily, née Gipps. His siblings were Arthur, Ellen and Lucy. Lucy became the wife of Wilfred J. Barnes. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge and Wells Theological College; and ordained in 1889. His first post was as a curate at Stepney Parish Church. He was Examining Chaplain to the Bishop of Southwark from 1896 to 1909.

Frere was twice Superior of the order 1902–1913 and 1916–1922, and returned to it after resigning the see of Truro. He was consecrated bishop at Westminster Abbey on 1 November 1923, by Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury; and as he regarded membership of a religious order an obligation taking precedence over others, the bishop's palace became a branch house of the Community.

Frere assisted the Indian Malankara Orthodox Church with the foundation of the Bethany religious order in 1919: however the dioceses forming this church were received into the Roman Catholic communion in 1930.

He was a member of the Anglican delegation to the Malines Conversations in the 1920s, and active in various other ecumenical projects including relations with the Russian Orthodox Church. He was a noted liturgical historical scholar; he was also a high churchman and a supporter of Catholic ideas. In his early writings and addresses he emphasised the importance of spiritual life, and explained some of the liturgical revision which was then in preparation.

He played a major part in the proposed revision of the Church of England Book of Common Prayer in 1928, which was later rejected by Parliament, and was responsible for the service book for the Guild of the Servants of the Sanctuary. Some of the books which belonged to Walter Frere form part of the Mirfield Collection which is housed in the University of York Special Collections.

He died on 2 April 1938 and was buried at Mirfield.

It was declared Bien de Interés Cultural in 1912.

History 
The original church was constructed sometime in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, but following an earthquake in 1356, the current church was rebuilt and has been enlarged over time. During the archeological excavation of the area, it was confirmed that the church was built on the site of a former mosque, and the theory that the tower was a reused minaret was ruled out. The church exhibits characteristics of both gothic and mudéjar architecture, although it has been renovated several times over the years.

The restoration works directed by the municipal architect Juan Talavera y Heredia between 1923 and 1930 culminated with the installation of a gothic facade from the fourteenth century Iglesia de Santa Lucía which now covers the original mudéjar door of the Church of Santa Catalina.

864,52130079,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-baby,E-baby,"e-baby is a two-hander play written by Jane Cafarella that was premiered at Chapel Off Chapel in Melbourne in 2015.  It is set over a 16-month period in 2015–16 and deals with two women going through gestational surrogacy, the genetic mother of the embryo created by in vitro fertilisation, and the woman carrying the child. It has been described by Patricia Tobin as a ""quietly feminist play that asserts a heartfelt approach towards matters of infertility, adoption and motherhood"".

Plot
Catherine is an ex-patriate Australian lawyer living in London with her architect husband.  Aged in her mid-40s and having been through 18 cycles of in vitro fertilisation treatments over 11 years, Catherine is desperate for a child and gestational surrogacy is her last chance.  Nellie is a 28-year old Catholic woman living in Boston, Massachusetts, (where surrogacy is legal), with two children.  As a lawyer, Catherine ensures that the contract formed covers various topics which Nellie had not considered.  Nellie sees herself as altruistic, able to help Catherine's dearest wish for a child come true, but with different backgrounds, values, and wealth, some degree of conflict is inevitable.  Once Nellie has become pregnant, Catherine's controlling nature causes friction and Nellie gradually asserts herself – most notably when the contentious issue of selective reduction becomes relevant – and as it becomes clear that Catherine resents the experiences of pregnancy and child birth which she is missing.  Nellie's maintenance of a sometimes too-honest vlog is also a source of tension.  As seen in the images below, the relationship comes to involve substantial conflict and tension with each displaying their worst selves, to the point where Nellie shouts at one point ""I'm the one who's carrying this baby!"" eliciting the cold reply ""Yes. And I'm the one who's paying,"" from Catherine.  In a play where money is generally not the issue, we are still reminded that surrogacy does raise issues of the commodification of human life and that differences in socioeconomic status cannot be entirely set aside.

Scenes take place either in person in New York, or through electronic media (Skype, text messages, phone calls) with Catherine in London and Nellie in Massachusetts.  In one production, this was achieved by having the two actors on stage, sitting at computers and looking into tripod-mounted video cameras, with the images being projected onto the wall behind the stage (illustrated at left).  These enlarged images provide ""magnified clarities for the audience to engage and learn from"" and was described as an ingenious production approach as it has the effect of ""[a]mplifying emotional moments for the audience"" by allowing the audience ""to see close-ups of their faces and be a fly on the wall for tough conversations"".  The reviewer for Stage Whispers expressed concerns that this use of projections and technology-facilitated communications would be a distraction, but praised its simple execution as seeming ""entirely natural"" and as adding to the experience by achieving a closeness to the actors that is rare, even in very intimate theatres.

Thematic content
As Nadia Tass, puts it ""[t]his is a play for today – the advances in medicine create a new world that allows new possibilities – in e-baby we enter that world and explore the raw truth, the unbridled joy and the paradox of surrogacy through a carefully woven story of love, generosity and a newborn child.""  Cafarella chose to not delve into the issue of Nellie wanting to keep the child, allowing ""more nuanced, if less dramatic, questions to be raised,"" and used decades of research to explore issues without passing judgement. Gestational surrogacy has been a subject for Cafarella for years, and she is praised for touching ""on most of the biological, technical, ethical and legal aspects ... in the play's 95 minutes ... without the loud sound of boxes being ticked"".  Topics explored in the play which are regularly missed in exploring surrogacy issues include ""the blasé comments from relatives, the cold legal matters in a contractual obligation, [and] the instances where abortion becomes the best option to save a life"".

Catherine's character is both ""excited about the prospect of being a mother"" but also struggling with ""the desperation and shame that she [feels] in fear of being seen as less of a woman,"" while Nellie is ""not fully comprehending what she has agreed to, and [experiencing] the conflict this provokes with her religious beliefs,"" while each is dealing with a ""forced"" friendship.  The play is character-driven by the unlikely bond and blurred lines created by a commercial surrogacy agreement.  The story is affecting through its resolute avoidance of sentimentality, except for the ending which gave in to the sappiness which had been avoided until this point, though at least one reviewer described the final scene as ""like being slapped in the face, then hugged. I left with tears in my eyes.""  The play has also been criticised for cutting short difficult-to-watch scenes, rather than pushing deeper by allowing them to last longer, a weakness ascribed to Cafarella's relative inexperience as a playwright.  It ""gives a gentle education to the uneducated on the intricacies of surrogacy"" and ""skims the surface like a light comedy,"" thus taking a ""sensitive approach towards a poignant issue [w]ith its enthralling narrative and light comic touch"".  The play could delve more deeply into the topic as it does ""touch upon morally heavy issues with a keen sincerity that is hard to resist"" but in circumstances where ""women's rights over our bodies are being condemned, scrutinised and attacked now more than ever, it does feel like there's something more to give"".

Fiona Cameron, writing in The Music, commented that: ""E-Baby is a very rare theatrical beast: a two-handed play by women, starring women and about issues that affect women viscerally. Indeed, another such production doesn't readily spring to mind ... [and] the men in the characters' lives, well, they were so peripheral as to be almost incidental ... [in this] play about hope and trust and how two women who would otherwise never have crossed paths are connected by a surrogate pregnancy.""  This aspect was noted by other reviewers.  Susanne Gervay of the Society of Women Writers NSW Inc described the play as a ""bitter-sweet, funny, sad, real play of women"".  Carly Fisher stated that ""[f]inding a play with a cast  solely of two women is very unusual – finding one that has been produced and is performing is even less of an occurrence. Hopefully, ... more theatre companies will see the potential that a duologue holds and just how captivated an audience can be by the presence of just 2 women.""  She also loved that money ""was not the driving factor for enlisting as a surrogate but rather the burning desire to help someone fulfill a spiritual and moving part of the human condition and experience for a woman. This approach speaks volumes to the current climate in which the topics of surrogacy and IVF can be raised and presents a more humane interpretation of the surrogate than many other art forms have yet been daring enough to do"".

Production history

Jane Cafarella was an Australian journalist, and ""exhibits a journo's eye for research, balance and telling detail""  in writing plays, which she began in 2011.  e-baby is her first full-length play, and was premiered at the Chapel Off Chapel theatre in Melbourne in March 2015.  Anna McCrossin-Owen was the director and dramaturg with Carolyn Bock (Catherine) and Sarah Ranken (Nellie) doing ""a solid job in portraying the often-tense relationship between these two women"".

e-baby received a rehearsed reading at the So and So Arts Club in London on 14 July 2015, directed by Pamela Shermann and starring Kat Rogers (Catherine) and Becky Hands-Wicks (Nellie).  The club aims to link emerging and established artists, and the play was developed under the club's auspices; the club also reports that a companion piece to e-baby is under development.

The Sydney premiere was in October 2016 with the Ensemble Theatre under the direction of Nadia Tass, multi-award winner for her films Malcolm and Amy, and starred Danielle Carter as Catherine and Gabrielle Scawthorn as Nellie.  Carter and Scawthorn were described as bringing ""such life to their roles"" and being ""utterly believable – in equal parts loveable and frustrating – [so that] the heartbreak, when it comes, is visceral"".

It received its Hobart premiere in March 2017 with the Tasmanian Theatre Company as part of the 10 Days on the Island festival.

866,551475,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen%20Corrado,Volkswagen Corrado,"The Volkswagen Corrado is a compact four passenger (2+2), three door, front-engine, front-wheel-drive liftback coupe marketed by Volkswagen from 1988 until 1995, and manufactured by Karmann in Osnabrück, Germany.

Designed by Herbert Schäfer, the Corrado overlapped and eventually superseded Volkswagen's Scirocco model. 97,521 Corrados were manufactured over the seven year production run.

Overview

The Corrado's floorpan is based on the A2 platform (i.e. Mark 2 Golf/Jetta) and, with the exception of VR6 models, all versions use the subframes, suspension, steering and braking components from the Volkswagen A2 platform model range.

The VR6 uses suspension components from the A3 model range, including the rear axle assembly and some parts of the A3's 'plus' type front axle assembly. The subsequent wider front wheel track of the Corrado VR6 necessitated the fitting of new front wings with wider wheel arches and liners along with a new front bumper assembly.

The Corrado is noted for its flush mounted windows and active rear spoiler – which raises automatically when the car exceeds  ( in the North American market), automatically retracts at speeds below  or can be manually controlled by the driver.

Variants

Launched in the end of 1988 (three years before the end of Scirocco production), all Corrados were front-wheel drive and featured petrol engines. The Corrado debuted with two engine choices: a 1.8 litre 16-valve inline four with  (KR), and a supercharged 1.8 litre eight valve inline four, marketed as the G60 and delivering . 

The Corrado G60 is named for the G Lader with which it is equipped, a scroll supercharger whose interior resembles the letter ""G"".

There were also two special models of the G60. The G60 Jet was an economy version for the German market only, thought to be a run out model before the introduction of the VR6. This model was only available in four colours and featured a colour coded interior. Volkswagen could not confirm production numbers for the Jet model.

Another variant is Volkswagen Motorsport (VWMS) Corrado 16V G60. Although the 16 valve engine combined with the original G-Lader was appreciated within the enthusiast community, the model never saw series production. It is generally believed that only two factory built examples were manufactured, both in Nugget Yellow.

Volkswagen introduced two new engines for 1992. The first was a naturally aspirated 2.0 litre, 16 valve  inline four, basically a further development of the 1.8 litre engine; this engine was not made available to the North American market.

The second was the twelve valve VR6 engine, which came in two variants: a 2.8 litre  model for the United States and Canadian markets, and a  producing  at 5,800 rpm and  at 4,200 rpm of torque version for the European market, fuel feed by Bosch Motronic 2.7 fuel injection. In the United States, the model VR6 was marketed as the Corrado SLC (sport luxury coupe).

Upon revising the engine, Volkswagen updated the styling with a new front grill and foglamps. With the introduction of the VR6 engine, the G60 engine disappeared from the North American market after 1992 and European market in 1993. The VR6 engine provided a compromise between both V shaped and straight engines by placing the two cylinder banks at an angle of 15°, with a single cylinder head.

This design allowed engineers to fit a six cylinder engine into roughly the space previously occupied by four cylinder engines, while closely approaching the smoothness of a straight six design. 1994 was the last model year of the Corrado in the United States.

A 2.0 litre eight valve model  was produced in Europe in 1995. A limited edition only for the United Kingdom, the Corrado Storm, was also sold. Some discreet ""Storm"" badging, a colour keyed front grille, an additional Storm badge on the gear gaiter surround (an upgrade from the standard Karmann badge), 15 inch BBS ""Solitude"" alloy wheels, and standard fitment of some previously optional items (such as the leather heated front seats) differentiated this model from the base Corrado VR6.

Only five hundred were produced: 250 in Classic Green with a cream leather interior, and 250 in Mystic Blue, a colour unique to the Storm, with a black leather interior. The Campaign model was made only in 1992. It was a VR6 Corrado available solely with Dusty Mauve Pearl Effect paint and a brick red leather interior, and only six were ever produced.

The Corrado was offered in Japan at Yanase dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles, offering the 1.8 L engine with either the automatic or manual transmission. The larger VR6 would have been considerably more expensive to tax, as the engine was over two liters' displacement.

Reviews
Auto Express magazine describe it as ""Regarded as one of VW’s best ever drivers’ cars"". The VR6 model was listed as one of the ""25 Cars You Must Drive Before You Die"" by the British magazine Car, and 'By far the most desirable version of the Corrado' by Auto Express.

In MSN Autos 'Cool Cars We Miss' feature they listed the Corrado among the top eight ""Gone but not forgotten: a short list of cars once loved, still missed"", describing it in the following manner: ""The VW Corrado VR6 is coveted because of its seductive styling, road handling capabilities and its role as trailblazer, introducing the VR6 to the American market.""

In 1988, in the first incarnation of the BBC television show Top Gear, racing car driver and presenter Tiff Needell reviewed the Corrado in G60 form, giving it a positive review and stating that ""Handling wise, the Corrado is classic front wheel drive, and it's really very, very good indeed."" In November 2003, in Series 3 of the relaunched Top Gear, Richard Hammond identified the Corrado as a future classic, ""a kind of classic waiting in the wings... I think it's really rather special... the result is fantastic,"" but countered with the comment that it ""was too expensive, and nobody bought it.""

Life 
In partnership with William Holabird, Martin Roche designed buildings following the Chicago School and that were landmarks in the development of early sky scrapers. He worked for William Le Baron Jenney until 1881 when he joined William Holabird at Holabird & Simonds. One of their first commissions was Graceland Cemetery.  Ossian Simonds left the practice in 1883 to concentrate on landscape design, and the firm was renamed Holabird & Roche.

Together they contributed many innovations to the Chicago School including the Chicago School windows, which allowed more sunlight into office buildings. They designed buildings including the Marquette Building, the Cable Building (1899) and the Gage Building (1899).

Roche was a fine designer with an eye for Gothic architecture.  He designed the world's first Gothic-style skyscraper for the University Club of Chicago, which opened in 1908.  Later, the firm designed the  neoclassical Soldier Field (1924).

William Holabird died in 1923 and Martin Roche followed four years later.  Holabird's son John took over the firm with John Root, Jr., and it was renamed Holabird & Root.

868,24908187,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20Parish%20Meetinghouse,First Parish Meetinghouse,"The First Parish Meetinghouse is a historic colonial meeting house at Meeting House Road and Old Pool Road in Biddeford, Maine.  Built in 1758, it is the oldest public building in the city, and is one of the oldest buildings of its type in the state.  It served as a combined church and town hall until about 1840.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  It is now owned by the Biddeford Historical Society.

Description and history
The First Parish Meetinghouse is located at the triangular intersection of Old Pool Road (Maine State Routes 9 and 208) and Meeting House Road.  Set facing west, toward Meeting House Road, it is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation.  Its front facade is symmetrically arranged, with a pair of entrances at the ground level, and a single window in the gable at the gallery level.  The doorways and all windows are topped by lancet-arched Gothic louvers.  The main structure is built out of hand-hewn timbers.  The building originally had a belfry; this was apparently removed during alterations in 1840, in which the pulpit was lowered and soundboard removed.

The meetinghouse was built in 1758 by Nathaniel Perkins, a local master builder, pursuant to a vote by the Biddeford town meeting.  The congregation that met here is the ""mother congregation"" of both the congregation church in adjacent Saco and the present UCC congregation in Biddeford.  The meeting house was an important site in the community during the American Revolutionary War, when local organizing activities were held here.  It is also notable for its association with James Sullivan, who rose to prominence as a lawyer here and eventually became Governor of Massachusetts.

Today, the meeting house is used by the Biddeford Historical Society to hold lectures and educational events about Biddeford's history such as reenactment performances.

869,1096396,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical%20theory,Categorical theory,"In mathematical logic, a theory is categorical if it has exactly one model (up to isomorphism).  Such a theory can be viewed as defining its model, uniquely characterizing its structure.

In first-order logic, only theories with a finite model can be categorical.  Higher-order logic contains categorical theories with an infinite model.  For example, the second-order Peano axioms are categorical, having a unique model whose domain is the set of natural numbers 

In model theory, the notion of a categorical theory is refined with respect to cardinality.  A theory is -categorical (or categorical in ) if it has exactly one model of cardinality  up to isomorphism. Morley's categoricity theorem is a theorem of  stating that if a first-order theory in a countable language is categorical in some uncountable cardinality, then it is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities.

 extended Morley's theorem to uncountable languages: if the language has cardinality  and a theory is categorical in some uncountable cardinal greater than or equal to  then it is categorical in all cardinalities greater than .

History and motivation
Oswald Veblen in 1904 defined a theory to be categorical if all of its models are isomorphic. It follows from the definition above and the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem that any first-order theory with a model of infinite cardinality cannot be categorical. One is then immediately led to the more subtle notion of -categoricity, which asks: for which cardinals  is there exactly one model of cardinality  of the given theory T up to isomorphism?  This is a deep question and significant progress was only made in 1954 when Jerzy Łoś noticed that, at least for complete theories T over countable languages with at least one infinite model, he could only find three ways for T to be -categorical at some :

T is totally categorical, i.e. T is -categorical for all infinite cardinals .
T is uncountably categorical, i.e. T is -categorical if and only if  is an uncountable cardinal.
T is countably categorical, i.e. T is -categorical if and only if  is a countable cardinal.

In other words, he observed that, in all the cases he could think of, -categoricity at any one uncountable cardinal implied -categoricity at all other uncountable cardinals. This observation spurred a great amount of research into the 1960s, eventually culminating in Michael Morley's famous result that these are in fact the only possibilities.  The theory was subsequently extended and refined by Saharon Shelah in the 1970s and beyond, leading to stability theory and Shelah's more general programme of classification theory.

Examples
There are not many natural examples of theories that are categorical in some uncountable cardinal. The known examples include:
 Pure identity theory (with no functions, constants, predicates other than ""="", or axioms).
 The classic example is the theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic. Categoricity does not say that all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 as large as the complex numbers C are the same as C; it only asserts that they are isomorphic as fields to C. It follows that although the completed p-adic closures Cp are all isomorphic as fields to C, they may (and in fact do) have completely different topological and analytic properties. The theory of algebraically closed fields of given characteristic is not categorical in  (the countable infinite cardinal); there are models of transcendence degree 0, 1, 2, ..., .
 Vector spaces over a given countable field. This includes abelian groups of given prime exponent (essentially the same as vector spaces over a finite field) and divisible torsion-free abelian groups (essentially the same as vector spaces over the rationals).
 The theory of the set of natural numbers with a successor function.

There are also examples of theories that are categorical in  but not categorical in uncountable cardinals. 
The simplest example is the theory of an equivalence relation with exactly two equivalence classes, both of which are infinite. Another example is the theory of dense linear orders with no endpoints; Cantor proved that any such countable linear order is isomorphic to the rational numbers.

Properties

Every categorical theory is complete. However, the converse does not hold.

Any theory T categorical in some infinite cardinal  is very close to being complete. More precisely, the Łoś–Vaught test states that if a satisfiable theory  has no finite models and is categorical in some infinite cardinal  at least equal to the cardinality of its language, then the theory is complete.  The reason is that all infinite models are equivalent to some model of cardinal  by the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, and so are all equivalent as the theory is categorical in . Therefore, the theory is complete as all models are equivalent.  The assumption that the theory have no finite models is necessary.

It was the predecessor to the current National Rugby Championship. The competition, similar to New Zealand's ITM Cup and South Africa's Currie Cup, aimed to bridge the gap between existing club rugby and the international Super Rugby competition then known as Super 14. The ARC involved eight teams: three from New South Wales, two from Queensland, and one each from the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Western Australia.

From its inception the ARC divided many in Australian rugby, with arguments over the structure and format of the competition and concerns that the creation of arbitrary state-based teams undermined the strong club competitions in Sydney and Brisbane. On 18 December 2007, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) announced that the ARC would be scrapped due to financial losses of A$4.7 million (US$4.0 million, € 2.8 million, £2.0 million).

On 10 December 2013, Bill Pulver, the CEO of the Australian Rugby Union announced a new competition along similar lines, the National Rugby Championship, to include 8 to 10 teams in ""major population centres"".

The official announcement on the agreement of a national rugby competition in Australia was made in mid-2006, following a 70-person three-day summit in Sydney that agreed to an eight team competition. However, the competition was not without its share of controversy, with some of the clubs being against the forming of a new level of competition, claiming it could harm club and grass roots rugby. In September an ARU board meeting gave the competition an official green light. A month later the competition kicked off for its inaugural year, the Queensland teams performed poorly as the East Coast Aces & Ballymore Tornadoes finished last & second last respectively. The Perth Spirit performed the best out of the regular rounds winning 6 out of 8 games although due to bonus points finished third on the ladder behind Central Coast Rays & the competitions first minor-premiers the Western Sydney Rams. After the top four teams took part in the semi-finals the Melbourne Rebels and Central Coast Rays would compete in the first ever ARC Grand Final. The Rays took out the competition defeating the Melbourne side 20–12.

A review of the tournament was undertaken following the 2007 season. This review found that the competition had run at more than $2 million over budget and that forecast losses for the 2008 season came to a further $3.3 million. The ARU said that the cumulative loss of $8 million over two years would be fiscally irresponsible.

Format

Competition 
The competition ran for eight weeks, with finals being competed over an additional two weeks - each side played eight games, with the top four teams qualifying for the semi-finals where the winners move into the final. The competition kicked off in August, after the Super 14 and the March to July club competitions finished, and avoiding a clash with Australian under-19 and under-21 duties and the Pacific Nations Cup (in which Australia A played). In total, 35 matches were played in the ARC over 10 weeks from 11 August and 14 October, with games played on Fridays and Sundays. It was originally planned that games would not be played at 'traditional' times for rugby matches, but this decision was changed when the ABC insisted that its televised games be played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.  The inaugural final was played between the Central Coast Rays and the Melbourne Rebels in Gosford.

Players 
The timeframe of the season ensured the availability of Super 14 players (excluding Wallabies). There was no draft, and players were free to choose their team, although there was a salary cap in place. Players came from local competitions (which includes Super 14 players). Each Super 14 franchise was aligned with the respective teams, except for Melbourne, as Victoria had no Super rugby team at the time.

It was planned that although 35 footballers will be on international duty for the Wallabies, over 90 Super 14 players would go into the ARC, leaving the way for over 120 footballers to step up from first grade club competitions.

It was also planned that each team would have one ""marquee"" footballer not be subject to financial restrictions of the player contracting protocol. The player could be either foreign or a non-contracted domestic footballer, and if a team signed an Australian as their marquee footballer, they would still be able to sign up a foreign footballer, though they would have to fit within the contract restrictions.

Rules 
The ARU announced in June 2007 that the inaugural championship would adopt the Experimental Law Variations (ELVs), which were initially trialled at South Africa's Stellenbosch University and which aim to bring more free-flowing play into the game. The laws were implemented in both the Sydney and Brisbane club competitions and were well received.

Referees 
The referees supplied for the tournament predominantly come from the Australian Rugby Union Panels.

Referees for the tournament included: Matt Goddard, James Leckie, James Scholtens, George Ayoub, Daniel Cheever, Brett Bowden, Andrew Lindsay and Geoff Acton.

Stuart Dickinson and Paul Marks did not referee in the tournament, as they refereed at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France.

Media coverage 
The championship was broadcast on free to air television during its only season. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) ""secured"" the rights to exclusively televise the competition from 2007 through to 2009 by agreeing to accept a substantial fee from the ARU in order to cover the matches. The fact that the sport's governing organisation had to pay a television station to broadcast the game arguably has worrying implications for a code struggling to attract mainstream interest in Australia. The ABC committed to broadcast 19 matches during the season on ABC1 and ABC2: two matches from each round, plus the semi-finals and the final. The previous time that the ABC covered elite level rugby was for the 1991 Rugby World Cup (which Australia also won).

Regular season 2007 
The eight teams played four home games and four away games each during the preliminary competition rounds, consisting of a single round-robin with each team playing each other once plus an additional return match for the ""derby"" fixture played in the first round (these fixtures were matches between the closest neighbouring teams in most cases). The top four teams at the end of the preliminary competition rounds qualified for the title play-offs with semi-finals and finals.

879,33091749,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount%20Halcon,Mount Halcon,"Mount Halcon () and () is the highest mountain in the island of Mindoro in the Philippines, with an elevation of  above sea level. It is the 18th-highest peak in the Philippines and 37th-highest peak of an island on Earth. Its steep slopes have earned it the reputation of being the most difficult mountain to climb in the country. The first documented ascent was made in 1906 by botanist Elmer Drew Merrill and a party of forestry and military personnel.

Inhabitants
Mount Halcon is home to the indigenous Alangan Mangyans.

Flora and fauna
Its thick vegetation contains much flora and fauna, including the critically endangered Mindoro bleeding-heart which is endemic to the area, and the stick insect Conlephasma enigma, which was first described in 2012.

History
The mountain was also the location of a possible World War II Japanese holdout. Isao Miyazawa found evidence that his comrade Captain Fumio Nakahara was living there in 1957. Another search in 1977 was called off due to Miyazawa contracting malaria. In 1980, Miyazawa found Nakahara's hut, and the natives talked to him extensively about the foreigner. However, Nakahara himself has never been spotted.

880,41694510,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Brown%20Building,William Brown Building,"The William Brown Building is a historic commercial building in Rockford, Illinois, United States. Completed in 1892, it is considered a fine local example of Romanesque Revival architecture. It was one of the last major commercial buildings in Rockford between the Panic of 1893 and the Roaring Twenties.

History
By the 1890s, the west downtown district of Rockford, Illinois was finally beginning to eclipse the east downtown district. The construction of the Chestnut Street bridge opened the southern part of Main Street to commerce. The architect of the building is unknown. The Nelson House, sharing some architectural similarities, was completed the next year and may have had the same architect: D. S. Shureman. Judge William Brown was a successful lawyer and politician in the city who died during construction. The building was named in his honor.

The People's Bank of Rockford was the first tenant, moving in after construction. The Rockford Insurance Company soon followed. Until the completion of the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, the William Brown Building also hosted the local offices of the Grand Army of the Republic. However, soon after the building's completion, the Panic of 1893 occurred, freezing development in Rockford. For its role as a significant local example of Romanesque architecture, the National Park Service recognized the William Brown Building with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on August 10, 2000. When the West Downtown Rockford Historic District was created in 2007, the Brown building was listed as a contributing property.

881,5740521,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxy%20%28album%29,Moxy (album),"Moxy, also informally known as The Black Album or Moxy I, is the self-titled debut studio album by the Canadian hard rock and heavy metal band Moxy. Their independently produced album was released in 1975 by Polydor Records in Canada, then under Mercury Records label was reissued in 1976 for worldwide distribution, both labels were owned by PolyGram at the time (they are now owned by Universal Music Group).

The album was picked up by many radio stations in the United States and was one of the most requested albums in Texas. As a consequence, Moxy was picked up by the larger Mercury Records label in the US and a national distribution deal was made and the album was reissued in 1976. The album  produced the hit songs ""Can't You See I'm a Star"",  ""Train"",  ""Out of the Darkness""  and with ""Sail On Sail Away"" and ""Moon Rider"" that are still in the 2000s (decade) on regular rotation on several rock radio stations in Texas.  The album sold well because of heavy promotion by the label who released the album on  8 Track in large numbers.

Tommy Bolin was a guest musician on the album. He had previously been the lead guitarist for the James Gang and would go on to replace Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple. Bolin does all but two guitar solos. Earl Johnson performed all rhythm guitar and the solos on ""Sail On Sail Away"", ""Can't You See I'm A Star"" and the ending of ""Train"". Johnson was supposed to do all the guitar parts, but got into a disagreement with the producer and was tossed out of the studio. Bolin, being nearby, was asked by Moxy's manager Roland Paquin to fill in for Johnson. Paquin knew Bolin from when he was road manager for the James Gang. Bolin was only in the studio for this album,  contrary to popular belief that he appears  on Moxy II. Though Bolin's time with Moxy was short, the album is popular with his fans. Bolin's tone and phrasing were very similar to his classic James Gang sound.

Buddy Caine, who is listed on the album cover, did not join the band until after the album was finished.  Caine was initially brought on board by the band as a rhythm guitarist to free up Johnson so he could play the solos on stage that Bolin had played in the studio.

882,25505009,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower%20Saxon%20Mill%20Road,Lower Saxon Mill Road,"The Lower Saxon Mill Road () is a holiday route that guides visitors to watermills and windmills in the north German state of Lower Saxony and thus links the interests of historic monument conservation with those of the tourist industry.

Emblem

The mills of the Lower Saxon Mill Road are marked with the emblem (a sketch of the Hüven Mill in the Emsland) of the Lower Saxony and Bremen Mill Association (Mühlenvereinigung Niedersachsen-Bremen) and are furnished with an information board that describes both the history and the features of the individual mill.

Range
The mills on the Lower Saxon Mill Road are of various types: Most of them are watermills and windmills. Some have been converted into homes, others are used as museums or are still in service. Several of the mills can only be viewed externally. In the International Wind- and Watermill Museum at Gifhorn a ship mill may also be visited. There are horse mills in the Cloppenburg and Hösseringen Museum Villages. In several buildings, not otherwise identifiable as mills, there are motor mills (Motormühlen); a building in the village of Einen near Goldenstedt houses a former korn distillery with a steam mill. Hydropower stations like the Oldau power station on the river Aller also count as 'mills' for the purposes of the Lower Saxon Mill Road.

The Lower Saxon Mill Road also has windmills without sails and watermills without water wheels. Their inclusion should act as an incentive to owners to complete their mills.

History
The idea for the Lower Saxon Mill Road project emerged in 1996. At that time the Lüneburg Regional Council was looking for ways to improve tourism in a lasting way in northern Lower Saxony. As early as 1995 it had founded a society under the name ""Society for the Promotion of Historic Mills in the Region of the Lüneburg Milling Industry"" (Verein zur Förderung historischer Mühlen im Gebiet der Müllerinnung Lüneburg). This society had the aim of restoring windmills and watermills in its area, which initially covered the districts of Lüneburg, Harburg and Lüchow-Dannenberg, and supporting their preservation. The society also declared that it wanted to foster and preserve the traditions and culture associated with the milling trade.

Under the sponsorship of the Lüneburg Society, a working group was founded in 1996 from representatives of the district authorities, mill societies and local history museums. It gave the go ahead for the development of a tourist route through the mills of Lower Saxony. In 1998 the Lower Saxon Mill Road was established by the society, now renamed as the ""Society for the Promotion of Lüneburg Mills"" (Mühlenförderverein Lüneburg). Under its new name, the area of responsibility of the society was extended to include the districts of Celle and Uelzen. The first section of the Lower Saxon Mill Road was opened by the then Lower Saxon Minister for Agriculture, Karl-Heinz Funke, on German Mill Day in 1998 at the Bardowick windmill. The Mill Road then consisted of 75 mill sites in the northeast of Lower Saxony.

From 1998 the Lüneburg mill society was responsible for coordinating, monitoring and implementating the restoration and refurbishment of mills on the Lower Saxon Mill Road and for the development of touristic marketing concepts as well as funding them from German and European sponsors.

Since 1996 the Lower Saxon state parliament has pursued the aim of extending the Mill Road to the whole of Lower Saxony. For that reason in 2004 leadership of the project was transferred to the statewide ""Lower Saxony and Bremen Mill Association"" ( Mühlenvereinigung Niedersachsen-Bremen). Other regions between the North Sea and the rivers Elbe and Weser were added to the road in 2005. On 8 July 2006 the Mill Road was expanded into the area between the Weser and the Hunte (the districts of Nienburg/Weser and Diepholz). In 2006 the route was  long and incorporated 256 mills.

With the conclusion of the EU Sponsor Programme for the Development of Typical Rural Areas in August 2006 further expansion into the remaining Lower Saxon districts was temporarily halted.

In 2009 public funding became available again. In that year the districts of Cloppenburg, Oldenburg and Vechta joined the Lower Saxon Mill Road. The section in the ""Oldenburg Münsterland and Wildeshausen Geest Region"" was officially opened on 28 May 2009 at the Neumühle (""New Mill"") in Endel (in the municipality of Visbek). Today the Lower Saxon Mill Road is  long and links 301 historic mills across North Germany.

The next regions to be incorporated into the Lower Saxon Mill Road will be the East Frisian districts of Aurich, Leer, Wittmund as well as the Oldenburg districts of Ammerland, Friesland and Wesermarsch. By 2011 all the regions and districts of Lower Saxony should be covered.

Organisation and funding
Today the ""Mill Road Working Group"" of the ""Lower Saxony and Bremen Mill Association"" (Arbeitsgruppe Mühlenstraße in der Mühlenvereinigung Niedersachsen-Bremen) is responsible for handling all issues to do with the Lower Saxon Mill Road. The Lower Saxon Minister of Agriculture, currently Hans-Heinrich Ehlen, acts as its patron. The Mill Road is supported by 120 sponsor organisations and societies across the state.

In 2009 the participating districts and towns contributed €3,000 each. A grant of €9,800 is anticipated from the Lower Saxon State Department for Geographic Information, Land Development and Property.

Lower Saxon Mill Road No. 65

International Wind- and Watermill Museum at Gifhorn
On 15 hectares of land at the International Wind- and Watermill Museum in Gifhorn there are 14 rebuilt, original and replica mills from across Europe and, in one case, from Korea, set in landscapes typical of their place of origin. In the exhibition hall there are numerous mill models. Also on the site is a village square (the Dorfplatz) with Lower Saxon houses and a Russian stave church.

Eyendorf windmill (Harburg district)

Lower Saxon Mill Road No. 24

The windmill was erected in 1897 by the mill builder, Bergmann, from Salzhausen. It was built as an Erdholländer with single-storey base, west of Eyendorf on the high geest. In 1911 a diesel engine was installed to boost its power. The mill is fitted with spring sails (Jalousieklappenflügeln) and a double fantail. In 1972 the cap was blown off by a hurricane.
The mill was not rebuilt until 1981 by the Society for the Preservation of the Eyendorf Windmill, founded in 1978, so that commercial milling could be continued until the end of the 1980s. In May 1998 a pine sail broke during a mill festival. The sail was replaced that year by a longleaf pine sail but had to be changed again in 2000 by steel rods. 
The mill is used as a museum and is brought into operation for specific occasions. On the last Saturday in May there is an annual mill festival.

Garlstorf windmill (Harburg district)

Lower Saxon Mill Road No. 37

The Garlstorf windmill is a Galerieholländer with a two-storey brick base and a four-storey, very narrow, slate-covered octagonal millhouse. It was erected in 1865 by the Benecke brothers from Kirchgellersen. The waisted shape of the octagonal tower was meant to reduce wind eddies around the sails and so ensure better use of the wind. The mill was initially operated by Herrmann Benecke, but then underwent several changes of ownership. It was bought in 1920 by the mill owner, Heinrich Bornemann, from Luhmühlen, who converted it in 1924 into a motor mill and in 1934 made the millhouse bigger. In 1964 the mill was operated with three rollers and a meal conveyor (Schrotgang). Thereafter it changed hands several times and was gradually closed down and converted into a residence. The internal mill machinery was removed. The present owner has carried out extensive restoration and equipped the mill with sails and a fantail again. Current state of the mill: The cap is covered with wooden shingles and equipped with an additional gallery. Like the four sails it is fixed. The cast iron shaft head (Wellenkopf), which has been drilled through, indicates that originally the mill had spring sails. The breastpiece (Bruststück) and the rods of the present sails are made of multilayered spars held together by steel clamps.

It is the second novel in The Strain Trilogy, and was preceded by The Strain and followed by The Night Eternal.

Plot synopsis
The vampire race is descended from seven vampiric ""Ancient Ones."" A vampire faction led by a renegade Ancient known as the Master instigates the takeover of human civilization. Elderly billionaire Eldritch Palmer, having been promised immortality by the Master, uses his influence to create a news blackout, ensuring that the vampires face little resistance. Abraham Setrakian, an elderly vampire hunter, is hopeful that the lost grimoire, Occido Lumen, holds the key to defeating the Master, and searches for it before the Master's forces take over. Setrakian is aided by epidemiologist Dr. Ephraim Goodweather and pest exterminator Vasiliy Fet, who have joined those resisting the vampires. Goodweather also seeks to protect his son, Zach, from his wife, Kelly, who is now a vampire and is driven by an animalistic instinct to convert her family. Meanwhile, the other Ancient Ones enlist gang member Gus Elizalde to destroy the Master.

Characters

Dr. Ephraim Goodweather
Former head of the CDC's rapid-response team, the Canary Project, Eph is now a fugitive from the law, trying to prevent the vampire plague from spreading to the rest of the country, and to protect his son Zach from his recently turned ex-wife, Kelly.  Having failed to kill the Master in the previous novel, Eph becomes obsessed with trying to kill Eldritch Palmer, convinced that the Master's plan will fail without Palmer's financial backing and campaign of disinformation.

Dr. Nora Martinez
Former second-in-command of the Canary Project, Nora takes an active role in fighting the spreading vampire plague, but finds herself growing distant from Eph, her former lover.

Professor Abraham Setrakian
A Holocaust survivor, who first encountered the Master in the Treblinka extermination camp in 1943, Setrakian has dedicated his life to destroying the Master.  Having failed to do so through the normal vampire-killing methods, Setrakian re-dedicates himself to the search for the Occido Lumen, an ancient medieval manuscript that he believes contains the secret for eradicating the vampires.  He is desperate to complete this quest before he dies of incipient heart disease.

The Master
One of the seven original ""Ancients,"" the propagators of the vampire race.  Having successfully crossed to America and overrun Manhattan, the Master now seeks to implement the next phase of his plan: causing a nuclear winter that allows only a few hours of sunlight per day.  By the end of the novel, he has transferred his consciousness into the body of rock star Gabriel Bolivar.  Though he is confident of his victory, he is vexed by Setrakian's efforts to obtain the Occido Lumen, the one thing he and the other Ancients fear.

Thomas Eichhorst 
Former Nazi commandant of the Treblinka extermination camp where Setrakian was held. Eichhorst was transformed into a vampire shortly after World War II and has since been the Master's main servant. Eichhorst's knowledge about imprisonment and exterminating large numbers of people would be useful to the Master's ""New Order.""  A fully mature vampire, Eichhorst nonetheless often dons prosthetics, a wig, and extensive makeup to appear human in order to perform the Master's will in public settings.

In the television series, he is played by Richard Sammel.

Vasiliy Fet

With his experience as an exterminator, Fet is useful in employing new strategies to defeat the strigoi. Although his extreme arrogance can sometimes be a road block for the group, Fet, on countless occasions, has assisted the group with a vast variety of ideas.

Augustin Elizalde
Recruited by the three American Ancients as a ""day hunter"" against the Master's strain, Gus assembles a rag-tag band of fighters, including aged luchador Angel and silver-toothed gangster Alfonso Creem.

Eldritch Palmer
Having successfully brought the Master to America, Palmer now employs his vast fortune and political influence to discredit Eph and anyone else trying to spread the word about the vampire plague.  He has also spent the last ten years building a series of nuclear power plants all over the world in order to create the Master's nuclear winter.  However, he is increasingly vexed by the Master's continued refusal to perform his side of their bargain, and transform Palmer into an immortal vampire.

Dr. Everett Barnes
The Director of the Centers for Disease Control, and Eph and Nora's former superior.  Taken in at first by Palmer's disinformation campaign, Barnes eventually learns the truth, and decides to collaborate with Palmer and the Master, doing his best to ensure that the vampires' subjugation of the human race is as orderly and peaceful as possible.  He comforts himself with the belief that there is no point in resisting the vampires, and all they can do is submit rather than risk the Master's wrath.  Eph comes to despise Barnes almost as much as he hates Palmer.

Kelly Goodweather
Eph's former wife, now a vampiric drone driven by the need to infect him and their son, Zach.

Mr. Quinlan
Known as ""the Born"", Mr. Quinlan is a rare human/vampire hybrid—the son of a young woman long ago who, while pregnant, was then infected by the Master. Likely the most deadly and skilled hunter in all of human history, he has fought in everything from gladiatorial games in the Roman Colisseum, to modern battlefields. Today, he is the Ancients' chief hunter and bodyguard. He is efficient and loyal, recruiting Gus Elizalde to help him and his squad in their mission to kill the Master. Mr Quinlan is disgusted by his maker's actions, and is determined to stop him at all costs.

Reception
Gina McIntyre of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""You have to hand it to del Toro and Hogan. At a time when brooding, sexy vampires are so ubiquitous in popular culture thanks to True Blood and Twilight, the authors finally have given the creatures back some of their nasty, vicious, delicious bite.""
The San Francisco Chronicles Alan Cheuse wrote that ""most readers will find themselves turning pages with the momentum of an engaged movie viewer"", but criticized the pacing of the early sections, saying ""the only problem the book has is that it is a middle volume in a trilogy"".

884,12749700,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal%20orders%20of%20Nigeria,Postal orders of Nigeria,"The first postal orders of Nigeria were issued by the British colonial authorities. Later, Nigeria issued its own postal orders, first in £,s,d, and then in the new currency of the Naira. In 2018, the postal order system was replaced by a cheaper money order system.

Nigerian-issued British postal orders
British postal orders began being issued and encashed in Nigeria from 1907, being issued with separate overprints of Northern and Southern Nigeria, but none are known to survive from the north and only four from Southern Nigeria.

Nigerian postal orders

Nigeria became independent from Britain on 1 October 1960 and after then began to issue postal orders in its own right denominated in Nigerian pounds, shillings, and pence, although records at the British Library indicate that these were at first supplied by Britain's Crown Agents. A number of proof Nigerian postal orders dated 1964 and 1965 are contained in the Crown Agents Archive of the British Library Philatelic Collection. New postal orders were issued in 1973, when Nigeria changed over to the decimal currency of the Naira.

In 1987, Nipost was charged with providing postal order services within Nigeria under Act No. 18 of that year. In late 2018, Nipost replaced the disused postal order service with a domestic electronic Money Order whose commission is less than the postal orders and can be obtained at any post office or sub-post office enabling rural and urban communities to transfer money easily. The domestic service supplements the international version.

885,29021216,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill%20Lyndon,Bill Lyndon,"Bill Lyndon (born 30 January 1964) is an Australian former strongman competitor. Lyndon is a 5-time winner of Australia's Strongest Man, and a 4-time entrant to the World's Strongest Man competition.

Early years
Bill Lyndon was born in Melbourne, Australia. He was one of seven children having five sisters and a brother. He was educated at high school in Melbourne and went on to business college, afterwards becoming a structural engineer. A keen sportsman, he played a variety of sports including Australian Rules Football, American Football, Rugby league, cycling and from the age of 23, powerlifting. His rugby league led him to spend two seasons in Perth and as a powerlifter he won four national powerlifting titles.

Strongman career
In terms of strongman competition his international career began after he was invited to Scotland for the 1993 World Muscle Power Classic. Some of Bill's competitors in this contest included: Gary Taylor, Manfred Hoeberl, Wayne Price, Magnus Ver Magnusson (referred to as ""Maggie"" by Lyndon) and Forbes Cowan. Although Lyndon did not feature among the contenders he found the experience of being around such renowned strongmen a rewarding one. The 1993 World's Strongest Man competition was held in Orange, France and Lyndon was considered for the last spot but Harold ""Iron Bear"" Collins was chosen that year. The following year, another triumph in Australia's Strongest Man secured Lyndon a spot at the 1994 World's Strongest Man contest, but failed to make the finals. Nathan Jones won the Australian title in 1995 and got the place at 1995 World's Strongest Man contest, where his arm was broken in an armwrestling match in the heats with 1998 World's Strongest Man champion Magnus Samuelsson. Lyndon went on to compete at the 1996 World's Strongest Man, 1997 World's Strongest Man and 1998 World's Strongest Man qualifying heats, but he was never able to qualify for the finals. In 1999, when the IFSA was still running WSM, Manfred Hoeberl set up a rival AFSA organization. Lyndon joined this and as such was banned by IFSA. Lyndon's decision was swayed by the fact that he was not getting enough competitions via IFSA. In 1998 he had only competed in Hungary and Morocco, whereas the AFSA offered five competitions in the first year.

Retirement
In the late 1990s Bill looked towards his own Australian based sports promotion company. He formed 'Spartan Warriors Australia' and began advertising extensively in magazines and at public events, He later started a website called Aussie Power designed to cover and feature many diverse athletes from strongman, powerlifters, olympic lifters, throwers covering Australia and the Asia Pacific region.

It is the second song that is part of their second studio album Lluvia de gallinas; released in 1984 by 20th Century Records.

Interpretation of the lyrics 
The lyrics of the song tell a fictional story about seeing death in a car accident and being told in first person. The text itself is a fallacy; because its author explained that the text is fictional, although he dedicated it to a cousin, who died in a traffic accident.  Thus, the text is written from the place of the victim and the feelings they may have felt to experience death.

It has become a classic of Argentine rock and was ranked #95 of the top 100 songs of Argentine rock.

It has also been performed by artists as diverse as Fabiana Cantilo, Hilda Lizarazu, and Olivia Viggiano, among others.

889,4468492,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow%20%28Pamuk%20novel%29,Snow (Pamuk novel),"Snow () is a novel by Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk. Published in Turkish in 2002, it was translated into English by Maureen Freely and published in 2004. The story encapsulates many of the political and cultural tensions of modern Turkey and successfully combines humor, social commentary, mysticism, and a deep sympathy with its characters.

Kar is the word for Snow, but the main character also abbreviates his name to Ka (his initials), with the novel set in the eastern Turkish city of Kars. An opening (and recurring) theme concerns reasons behind a suicide epidemic among teenage girls (which actually took place in the city of Batman).

Plot summary
Though most of the early part of the story is told in the third person from Ka's point of view, an omniscient narrator sometimes makes his presence known, posing as a friend of Ka's who is telling the story based on Ka's journals and correspondence. This narrator sometimes provides the reader with information before Ka knows it or foreshadows later events in the story. At times, the action seems somewhat dream-like. The story is set in the city of Kars which creates a sense of alienation for Ka as the city is unlike anywhere else in Turkey, due to its history as a Russian garrison town.

Ka is a poet, who returns to Turkey after 12 years of political exile in Germany. He has several motives, first, as a journalist, to investigate a spate of suicides but also in the hope of meeting a woman he used to know. Heavy snow cuts off the town for about three days during which time Ka is in conversation with a former communist, a secularist, a fascist nationalist, a possible Islamic extremist, Islamic moderates, young Kurds, the military, the Secret Service, the police and in particular, an actor-revolutionary. In the midst of this, love and passion are to be found. Temporarily closed off from the world, a farcical coup is staged and linked melodramatically to a stage play. 
The main discussion concerns the interface of secularism and belief but there are references to all of Turkey's twentieth century history.

Plot

Ka reunites with a woman named İpek, whom he once had feelings for, whose father runs the hotel he is staying in. Ipek is divorced from Muhtar, partly due to Muhtar's newfound interest in political Islam. In a café, Ka and Ipek witness the shooting of the local Director of the Institute of Education by a Muslim extremist from out of town. The shooter blames the director for the death of a young woman named Teslime, claiming she killed herself because of the director's ban on head-scarves in school. After the incident, Ka visits Muhtar, who tells him about his experience of finding Islam, which relates to a blizzard and meeting a charismatic sheikh named Saadettin Efendi. The police pick up Ka and Muhtar as part of their investigation of the Director's murder. Ka is questioned and Muhtar is beaten.

Though he has suffered from writer's block for a number of years, Ka suddenly feels inspired and composes a poem called ""Snow"", which describes a mystic experience. Other poems follow. At İpek's suggestion, Ka goes to see Sheikh Saadettin and confesses that he associates religion with a backwardness that he does not want himself or Turkey to fall into. But he feels a sense of comfort with the sheikh and begins to accept his new poems as gifts from God.

Ka is impressed by Necip, a student at the religious high school, who, like many of the young Muslims at the school, is quite taken by Kadife. The narrator lets the reader know that Necip will die soon. Growing tensions between secularists and Islamists explode during a televised event at the National Theater. A secular group puts on a classic play condemning head scarves; during the play, a number of soldiers take positions on stage. The leader of the theater group receives a messenger and announces the death of the Director of the Institute of Education. Immediately after this, the soldiers on stage start firing at the audience. Necip is among those killed. The police and military establish martial law, and Ka is taken in for questioning because he has been seen with Islamists. He is shattered to find Necip's body in the morgue and identifies him as the one who led him to Blue.

Ka is taken to meet Sunay Zaim, an actor whose group put on the play at the National Theater and who is now orchestrating the round-ups and investigations of suspicious persons. Zaim is a staunch Turkish Republican, who has played political leaders such as Robespierre, Napoleon and Lenin, but whose dream of playing Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, was frustrated. As the snow has made the roads and railroads impassable, no outside authorities are able to intervene in the coup. The isolation of Kars, and Zaim's's old friendship with the officer in charge of the local garrison, enabled him to become a revolutionary dictator in real life as well as on the stage, for at least a few days — his act being simultaneously a coup d'état and a coup de théâtre.

At this point, the narrator, who identifies himself as a novelist named Orhan, flashes forward four years and reveals that Ka spent the last years of his life obsessing over İpek and writing unsent letters to her before being murdered in Frankfurt. The narrator will play a much larger role in the story in the later chapters of the novel. We are clearly meant to identify the narrator with Orhan Pamuk himself, as he later names The Black Book as one of his works, as well as The Museum of Innocence, which he would publish in 2008.

Turgut Bey attends a meeting at which representatives from the various factions opposed to the coup, including Islamists, leftists, and Kurds, attempt  to produce a coherent statement to the European press denouncing the action. After Blue is arrested and held by the nationalists, Ka negotiates a deal with Sunay Zaim that will result in Blue's release, as long as Kadife agrees to play a role in Zaim's production of Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and removes her head-scarf on live television during the show. Both Kadife and Blue agree.

After a scene in which Ka is seen confused and tormented by feelings of pain and jealousy, the narrative describing events from his point of view abruptly breaks off. The narrator explains that Ka had left behind a detailed account of his acts and feelings while in Kars, but that there was no reference to his last hours in the city, and it is left to his friend Orhan to try to reconstruct these by following in Ka's footsteps, visiting the places where he had been and meeting the people he had met.

Ka's actions immediately after leaving the theater remain a mystery which is never completely untangled. Orhan is, however, able to establish that Ka was later taken by the military to the train station, where he was put on the first train scheduled to leave once the railroad reopened. Ka complied, but sent soldiers to retrieve İpek for him. However, just as İpek said her farewells to her father, news arrived that Blue and Hande were shot. İpek was shattered and blamed Ka for leading the police to Blue's hideout. Instead of going to Ka, she and her father went to the theater to see Kadife.

In the end it is disclosed that a new group of Islamic militants was formed by younger followers of Blue who had been forced into exile in Germany and based themselves in Berlin, vowing to take revenge for the death of their admired leader. It is assumed that one of them assassinated Ka and took away the only extant copy of the poems he had writtenritten, the poems themselves are lost.

It was the third time the event was held. 9 runners from 3 nations participated. The competition was held on September 3, 1904. The event was won by Jim Lightbody of the United States, completing his 1904 treble (800 metres, 1500 metres, and 2590 metres steeplechase). It was the first championship in the event for the United States. The Americans, with 7 of the 9 runners, swept the medals.

Background

This was the third appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. None of the runners from 1900 returned. The field again was fairly undistinguished; 1903 and 1904 AAA champion Alfred Shrubb of Great Britain and multiple AAU one-mile champion Alexander Grant of the United States did not compete. David Curtiss Munson, the 1904 AAU champion, was the favorite going into the Games, though Jim Lightbody's victories in the 800 metres and 2590 metres steeplechase made him a likely contender.

Canada made its first appearance in the event. The United States made its third appearance, the only nation to have also previously competed in 1896 and 1900.

Competition format

The competition consisted of a single round.

The track was a cinder track 1/3 mile in length with one long straightaway.

Records

These were the standing world and Olympic records prior to the 1904 Summer Olympics.

Jim Lightbody set a new Olympic record and a new unofficial world record at 4:05.4.

His political career began in 2001, but Eman has been involved in politics in one way or another since his childhood. His grandfather, father and brother were all prominent politicians in their lifetimes, with Henny Eman having preceded him in office (twice) as Prime Minister, including as the first to hold the office after Aruba's status aparte in 1986.

Eman is a graduate of the University of the Netherlands Antilles (UNA) earning his law degree in 1992 with a thesis entitled ""The Position of the Institution of the Public Prosecutor vis à vis the Minister of Justice in a Small Scale Community."" In 1996 he earned a degree in Civil Notary Law from the same university.

From 1992 to 2001, Eman worked as a deputy civil law notary and co-founded several private commercial ventures and foundations for political studies.

He began his formal political career in September 2001 when he appeared 3rd on the list of the AVP. The 2001 elections did not go in favor of the AVP causing the party to lose 4 seats in the parliament. This led to the decision of the AVP leader, Tico Croes, to relinquish position. The leadership was handed over to the former minister of Justice, Pedro E. (Eddy) Croes. Mike Eman became the party's VP and the minority whip leader in parliament. subsequently Eman was elected party leader in 2003. After the 2009  elections, the AVP regained 2 seats, and Eman's part became thus the majority party in parliament.

Eman first cabinet was sworn in October 30, 2009, following his party's decisive victory in the 2013 election; his second cabinet was sworn in on 30 October 2013.

Following the 2017 general election Eman's party lost its majority in the Parliament of Aruba. Eman subsequently announced that he would resign as party leader and that he would not take a seat in the upcoming parliament.

Early life and career 
Eman was born in Oranjestad, Aruba and raised in Rancho, to Albert (Shon A) Eman, at the time leader of the AVP and his wife Blanche Eman-Harthogh. Mike became the youngest brother of Maria Albertina (Chuchu), Jan Hendrik Albert (Henny), Melva, Godlieb, Siegfried (Ven), Frederik Everhard (Braat), and Albert.

Eman is Jewish and plays an active role in the Jewish community and has worked to promote the presence of Chabad in Aruba. His mother was Jewish and his father was Protestant.

893,50335361,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine%20Clifford-Lee,Lorraine Clifford-Lee,"Lorraine Clifford-Lee (born 22 September 1981) is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who has served as a Senator since June 2020.

She was nominated by the Taoiseach to become a Senator in June 2020, having previously been selected from the 2016 to 2020 Cultural and Educational Panel.

Early and personal life
Clifford-Lee was born in Waterford in 1981. She attended Our Lady of Mercy in Waterford and later studied at University College Cork where she became the Irish Officer on the Students Union.

She lives in Donabate with her husband John Lee and her daughter and son. Her husband, who is 10 years her senior, is the political editor of the Irish Mail on Sunday newspaper.

She is a self-employed solicitor and is a fluent Irish speaker.

Political career

2016 general election
After Clifford-Lee unsuccessfully contested a local election for a seat in the Pembroke-South Dock ward of Dublin City Council in 2015, she was selected, along with Darragh O'Brien, to be one of two Fianna Fáil candidates for the Dublin Fingal constituency in the 2016 general election. Clifford-Lee was selected to run in Dublin Fingal to ensure Fianna Fáil complied with gender quota rules.

The decision to add Clifford-Lee to the ticket was criticised by party insiders as tokenism and gratuitous. Darragh Butler, a long-time local Fianna Fáil councillor, stating ""due to gender quotas we are being overlooked in favour of a candidate who has no track record, no history and up to now, no visibility in the constituency.""

In the lead up to the election Clifford-Lee claimed that members of her team were intimidated by supporters of her running mate Darragh O'Brien whilethey were canvassing in Portmarnock. O'Brien denied knowledge of this but said that tempers can get a little frayed so close to polling day.

She was an unsuccessful candidate for the Dublin Fingal constituency polling 3,359 (5.6%) of first preferences and was eliminated on the ninth count, while her running mate Darragh O'Brien was elected on the first count, topping the poll.

On her election to the Seanad, she was appointed as the Fianna Fáil Seanad Spokesperson for Justice, Children and Youth Affairs. In November 2018, she was appointed Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad.

2019 by-election
Clifford-Lee was a candidate in the 2019 Dublin Fingal by-election to fill the seat vacated following Independents 4 Change's Clare Daly election to the European Parliament in May 2019.

Racist tweets scandal
At the start of the campaign, multiple tweets emerged where Clifford-Lee appeared to make derogatory and xenophobic comments portraying negative and xenophobic attitudes towards foreigners, Irish Travellers as well as ableist and body shaming tweets about females.

She was forced to apologise the tweets from 2011. She refused calls to stand down as a candidate, claiming she was the victim of a smear campaign, while Fianna Fáil did not discipline her.

By-election result
There was a record low turn out for the constituency of 25.59% and the seat was won by the Green Party. Clifford-Lee received 18.5% of the first preference votes, coming second, and was eliminated on the final count.

2020 general election
She was also an unsuccessful candidate for Dublin Fingal at the 2020 general election. She lost her seat at the 2020 Seanad election, but was restored to Seanad Éireann after being nominated by the Taoiseach Micheál Martin, her party leader, in June 2020.

894,2344134,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous%20fistula,Arteriovenous fistula,"An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection or passageway between an artery and a vein. It may be congenital, surgically created for hemodialysis treatments, or acquired due to pathologic process, such as trauma or erosion of an arterial aneurysm.

Presentation

Associated conditions
 Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia

Complications
Just like berry aneurysm, an intracerebral arteriovenous fistula can rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Causes
The cause of this condition include
 Congenital (developmental defect)
 Rupture of arterial aneurysm into an adjacent vein
 Penetrating injuries
 Inflammatory necrosis of adjacent vessels
 Intentionally created (for example, Cimino fistula as vascular access for hemodialysis). Blood must be aspirated from the body of the patient, and since arteries are not easy to reach compared to the veins, blood may be aspirated from veins. The problem is that the walls of the veins are thin compared to those of the arteries. The AV fistula is the solution for this problem because, after 4-6 weeks, the walls of the veins become thicker due to the high arterial pressure. Thus, this vein can now tolerate needles during hemodialysis sessions.

Mechanism
When an arteriovenous fistula is formed involving a major artery like the abdominal aorta, it can lead to a large decrease in peripheral resistance. This lowered peripheral resistance causes the heart to increase cardiac output to maintain proper blood flow to all tissues. The physical manifestations of this typically consist of a relatively normal systolic blood pressure accompanied by decreased diastolic blood pressure, resulting in a wider pulse pressure.

Normal blood flow in the brachial artery is 85 to 110 milliliters per minute (mL/min). After the creation of a fistula, the blood flow increases to 400–500 mL/min immediately, and 700–1,000 mL/min within 1 month. A brachiocephalic fistula above the elbow has a greater flow rate than a radiocephalic fistula at the wrist. Both the artery and the vein dilate and elongate in response to the greater blood flow and shear stress, but the vein dilates more and becomes ""arterialized"". In one study, the cephalic vein increased from 2.3 mm to 6.3 mm diameter after 2 months. When the vein is large enough to allow cannulation, the fistula is defined as ""mature"".

An arteriovenous fistula can increase preload. AV shunts also decrease the afterload of the heart. This is because the blood bypasses the arterioles which results in a decrease in the total peripheral resistance (TPR). AV shunts increase both the rate and volume of blood returning to the heart.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of this condition can be done via ultrasound

Achievements 
MBDS has applied epidemiology and GIS, initiated tabletop exercises (TTXs) on Pandemic Preparedness in country and regional levels in 2006 and 2007. It is prepared to conduct at least one outbreak investigation, TTX or drill at each cross-border site each year, seeking to conduct joint investigation of a zoonotic disease as a particular priority.

In May 2007, the extension of MOU was signed by the six MBDS health ministers in Geneva, for indefinite time period. With the increasing number of cross-border sites, MBDS developed a new 6-year action plan focusing on seven inter-
related core strategies.

It piloted cross-border co-operation, with the exchange of regular disease information on a daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly basis, cross-border meetings, monitoring and evaluation, multi-sector engagement (especially immigration, local authorities), cross-border epidemiologic case history, cross-border medical care and clinical follow-up to nearby provincial areas. It has used 2-way ICT-based communications between local, provincial and central levels in routine surveillance reporting and outbreak investigation (examples include equipment and protocols for communications through internet, cell phone SMS messaging, satellite telephones, telephone hotline, email).

It has also trained field epidemiologist and health officials of Member Countries through treating FETP alumni as training staff for countries to establish new long-term and short-term epidemiology training programs, at the same time enhancing short-course training in each member country by supporting curriculum design and training or providing lecturers/expert.  During 2006-2007, 110 workers were trained in either field epidemiology and disease surveillance, analytical techniques or social, political and economic aspects of border health.

An unprecedented joint avian influenza investigation was triggered when an infected Lao citizen was found in Thailand. Since then, Vietnam and Lao PDR also carried out joint investigations for outbreaks of typhoid and malaria.

MBDS partners with Rockefeller Foundation (RF), Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), Google, RAND, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations System Influenza Coordination (UNSIC), US Agency for International Development (USAID)/Kenan Institute, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Google, InSTEDD, ChangeFusion, Opendream.

906,298747,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambeth,Lambeth,"Lambeth () is a district in South London, England, in the London Borough of Lambeth, historically in the County of Surrey. It is situated  south of Charing Cross. The population of the London Borough of Lambeth was 303,086 in 2011. The area experienced some slight growth in the medieval period as part of the manor of Lambeth Palace. By the Victorian era the area had seen significant development as London expanded, with dense industrial, commercial and residential buildings located adjacent to one another. The changes brought by World War II altered much of the fabric of Lambeth. Subsequent development in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has seen an increase in the number of high-rise buildings. The area is home to the International Maritime Organization.

History
The origins of the name of Lambeth come from its first record in 1062 as Lambehitha, meaning 'landing place for lambs', and in 1255 as Lambeth. In the Domesday Book, Lambeth is called ""Lanchei"", likely in error. The name refers to a harbour where lambs were either shipped from or to. It is formed from the Old English 'lamb' and 'hythe'. South Lambeth is recorded as Sutlamehethe in 1241 and North Lambeth is recorded in 1319 as North Lamhuth.

The manor of Lambeth is recorded as being under ownership of the Archbishop of Canterbury from at least 1190. The Archbishops led the development of much of the manor, with Archbishop Hubert Walter creating the residence of Lambeth Palace in 1197. Lambeth and the palace were the site of two important 13th-century international treaties; the Treaty of Lambeth 1217 and the Treaty of Lambeth 1212. Edward, the Black Prince lived in Lambeth in the 14th century in an estate that incorporated the land not belonging to the Archbishops, which also included Kennington (the Black Prince road in Lambeth is named after him). As such, much of the freehold land of Lambeth to this day remains under Royal ownership as part of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall. Lambeth was also the site of the principal medieval London residence of the Dukes of Norfolk, but by 1680 the large house had been sold and ended up as a pottery manufacturer, creating some of the first examples of English delftware in the country. The road names, Norfolk Place and Norfolk Row reflect the history and legacy of the house today.

Lambeth Palace lies opposite the southern section of the Palace of Westminster on the Thames. The two were historically linked by a horse ferry across the river. Until the mid-18th century the north of Lambeth was marshland, crossed by a number of roads raised against floods. The marshland in the area, known as Lambeth Marshe, was drained in the 18th century but is remembered in the Lower Marsh street name. With the opening of Westminster Bridge in 1750, followed by the Blackfriars Bridge, Vauxhall Bridge and Lambeth Bridge itself, a number of major thoroughfares were developed through Lambeth, such as Westminster Bridge Road, Kennington Road and Camberwell New Road. Until the 18th century Lambeth was still partly rural in nature, being outside the boundaries of central London, although it had experienced growth in the form of taverns and entertainment venues, such as theatres and Bear pits (being outside inner city regulations). The subsequent growth in road and marine transport, along with the development of industry in the wake of the industrial revolution brought great change to the area.

The area grew with an ever-increasing population at this time, many of whom were considerably poor. As a result, Lambeth opened a parish workhouse in 1726. In 1777 a parliamentary report recorded a parish workhouse in operation accommodating up to 270 inmates. On 18 December 1835 the Lambeth Poor Law Parish was formed, comprising the parish of St Mary, Lambeth, ""including the district attached to the new churches of St John, Waterloo, Kennington, Brixton, Norwood"". Its operation was overseen by an elected Board of twenty Guardians. Following in the tradition of earlier delftware manufacturers, the Royal Doulton Pottery company had their principal manufacturing site in Lambeth for several centuries. The Lambeth factory closed in 1956 and production was transferred to Staffordshire. However the Doulton offices, located on Black Prince Road still remain as they are a listed building, which includes the original decorative tiling.

Between 1801 and 1831 the population of Lambeth trebled and in ten years alone between 1831 and 1841 it increased from 87,856 in to 105,883. The railway first came to Lambeth in the 1840s, as construction began which extended the London and South Western Railway from its original station at Nine Elms to the new terminus at London Waterloo via the newly constructed Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct. With the massive urban development of London in the 19th century and with the opening of the large Waterloo railway station in 1848 the locality around the station and Lower Marsh became known as Waterloo, becoming an area distinct from Lambeth itself.

The Lambeth Ragged school was built in 1851 to help educate the children of destitute facilities, although the widening of the London and South Western Railway in 1904 saw the building reduced in size. Part of the school building still exists today and is occupied by the Beaconsfield Gallery. The Beaufoy Institute was also built in 1907 to provide technical education for the poor of the area, although this stopped being an educational institution at the end of the 20th century.

Lambeth Walk and Lambeth High Street were the two principal commercial streets of Lambeth, but today are predominantly residential in nature. Lambeth Walk was site of a market for many years, which by 1938 had 159 shops, including 11 butchers. The street and surrounding roads, like most of Lambeth were extensively damaged in the Second World War. This included the complete destruction of the Victorian Swimming Baths (themselves built in 1897) in 1945, when a V2 Rocket hit the street resulting in the deaths of 37 people.

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's headquarters were located in Lambeth High Street from 1976 until 2015.

Local governance

The current district of Lambeth was part of the large ancient parish of Lambeth St Mary in the Brixton hundred of Surrey. It was an elongated north–south parish with a two-mile River Thames frontage to the west. In the north it lay opposite the cities of London and Westminster and extended southwards to cover the contemporary districts of Brixton, West Dulwich and West Norwood, almost reaching Crystal Palace. Lambeth became part of the Metropolitan Police District in 1829. It continued as a single parish for Poor Law purposes after the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and a single parish governed by a vestry after the introduction of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855. In 1889 it became part of the County of London and the parish and vestry were reformed in 1900 to become the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth, governed by Lambeth Borough Council. In the reform of local government in 1965, the Streatham and Clapham areas that had formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth were combined with Lambeth to form the responsible area of local government under the London Borough of Lambeth. The current mayor is Annie Gallop as of May 2021.

Local politics

The council is run by a leader and cabinet. All cabinet members are from the Labour Party.
 
The leader of the opposition is Green Party Co-leader Jonathan Bartley and the leader of the Conservative opposition is Timothy Briggs.
 
The chief executive is Andrew Travers.
 
Mark Bennett became mayor in March 2013, and died in February 2014. The current mayor as of May 2018, is Cllr Christopher Wellbelove.

 
In the 2016 EU referendum, Lambeth issued the highest ""Remain"" vote in the United Kingdom (besides Gibraltar) with almost 79% of residents advocating the United Kingdom staying in the European Union.
 
At the 2015 general election, all three Labour candidates were elected Kate Hoey for Vauxhall, Chuka Umunna for Streatham & Helen Hayes for Dulwich and West Norwood. The Conservative Party finished the runners up in all three seats.
 
At the snap 2017 general election, Hoey, Umunna and Hayes were re-elected with increased majorities. The Liberal Democrat candidate George Turner finished the runner up in Vauxhall achieving a 5% swing in his favour. The Conservative candidates Rachel Wolf and Kim Caddy finished the runner up in Dulwich & West Norwood and Streatham respectively.
 
At the 2018 local elections, Labour remained in control of the council with 57 of the 63 seats, (down 2 seats from 2014). The Greens gained 4 seats and achieved a total 5 seats. The Conservatives were reduced down to a single seat, and the Liberal Democrats failed to gain any seats, but did make some inroads into Wards in Northern Vauxhall and Southern Streatham.

In the 2019 EU elections, the Liberal Democrats won Lambeth with 33% of the vote, Labour were second with 21%, The Greens third with 19% and Change UK and The Brexit Party joint fourth on 8%.

In June 2019, Umunna defected to the Liberal Democrats.

Hoey stood down at the 2019 General Election and was replaced with Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who was the sitting London Assembly Member for Lambeth and Southwark. Ummuna stood down as an MP and was replaced with Bell Ribeiro-Addy where the Labour majority was cut by almost 10,000 by the 2nd placed Lib Dems. Hayes stood for re-election with the Green Party's Jonathan Bartley finishing in second place, for the first time.

Buildings and churches
The church of St Mary-at-Lambeth is the oldest above ground structure in Lambeth, the oldest structure of any kind being the crypt of Lambeth Palace itself. The church has pre-Norman origins, being recorded as early as 1062 as a church built by Goda, sister of Edward the Confessor. It was rebuilt in flint and stone between the years 1374 and 1377. The tower is the only original part still to survive, as much of the church was reconstructed by 1852. The church was de-consecrated in 1972 and since 1977 it has been the home of the Garden Museum.

Lambeth Palace is the home of the Archbishop of Canterbury and has been occupied as a residence by the Archbishops since the early 13th century. The oldest parts of the palace are Langton's Chapel and its crypt, both of which date back to the 13th century. Although they suffered greatly from damage in the Second World War, they have seen been extensively repaired and restored. Morton's Tower, the main entrance to the palace, was built in 1490. The Great Hall, rebuilt over different centuries but primarily following damage during the English Civil War, contains the vast collections of the Lambeth Palace Library. Later additions to the palace including the Blore Building, a newer private residence for the Archbishop, which was completed in 1833.

The Albert Embankment, finished in 1869 and created by the engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette under the Metropolitan Board of Works, forms the boundary of Lambeth. The embankment includes land reclaimed from the river and various small timber and boat-building yards, and was intended to protect low-lying areas of Lambeth from flooding while also providing a new highway to bypass local congested streets. Unlike the Thames Embankment on the opposite side of the river, the Albert Embankment does not incorporate major interceptor sewers. This allowed the southern section of the embankment (upstream from Lambeth Bridge) to include a pair of tunnels leading to a small slipway, named White Hart Draw Dock, whose origins can be traced back to the 14th century. Centuries later, Royal Doulton's pottery works used the docks to load clay and finished goods for transport to and from the Port of London. The refurbishment of White Hart Dock was carried out as part of a local art project in 2009, which included the addition of wooden sculptures and benches to the 1868 dock boundary wall.

Located on the Albert Embankment is the purpose-built headquarters of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The IMO is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping. The building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 May 1983. The architects of the building were Douglass Marriott, Worby & Robinson. The front of the building is dominated by a seven-metre high, ten-tonne bronze sculpture of the bow of a ship, with a lone seafarer maintaining a look-out from Lambeth to the Thames.

From 1937 until 2007 the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade were in Lambeth, on Albert Embankment. The headquarters building, constructed in an art deco style, was designed by architects of the London City Council and opened in 1937. Occupying a prominent position on the Thames it is, however, still an operating fire station, although future plans have been submitted which may see redevelopment of the listed building.

The Lambeth Mission is a church of the united Methodist Anglican denomination, located on Lambeth Road. The original church was founded in 1739 but was entirely destroyed by a bomb in the Second World War. A new church for the mission was constructed in 1950 and continues to function as an active church today.

The Beaconsfield gallery is a public contemporary art gallery in Lambeth, which was established in 1995 and specialises in temporary exhibitions and art classes. Morley College is an adult education college, founded in the 1880s, that occupies sites on either side of the boundary between the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth.

Literary Lambeth
In William Blake's epic Milton: A Poem in Two Books, the poet John Milton leaves Heaven and travels to Lambeth, in the form of a falling comet, and enters Blake's foot. This allows Blake to treat the ordinary world as perceived by the five senses as a sandal formed of ""precious stones and gold"" that he can now wear. Blake ties the sandal and, guided by Los, walks with it into the City of Art, inspired by the spirit of poetic creativity. The poem was written between 1804 and 1810.

Liza of Lambeth, the first novel by W. Somerset Maugham, is about the life and loves of a young factory worker living in Lambeth near Westminster Bridge Road.

Thyrza, a novel by George Gissing first published in 1887, is set in late Victorian Lambeth, particularly Newport Street, Lambeth Walk and Walnut Tree Walk. The novel was intended by Gissing to ""contain the very spirit of London working-class life"". The story tells of Walter Egremont, an Oxford-trained idealist who gives lectures on literature to workers, some of them from his father's Lambeth factory.

Leisure and recreation
Lambeth has several areas of public parks and gardens. This includes Old Paradise Gardens, which is a park occupying a former burial ground on Lambeth High Street and Old Paradise Street. A watch-house for holding the 'drunk and disorderly' existed on the site, from 1825 until 1930 and is today marked by a memorial stone. Lambeth Walk Open Space is a small public park to the east of Lambeth on Fitzalan Walk and includes several open spaces and play areas. Pedlars' Park is another small public park in Lambeth, which was created in 1968 on the site of the former St. Saviour's Salamanca Street School. Archbishop's Park is open to the public and borders the edge of Lambeth Palace and the neighbouring area of Waterloo and the hospital of St Thomas.

Transport
The nearest London Underground stations are Waterloo, Southwark and Lambeth North. London Waterloo is also a National Rail station as is Waterloo East which is located in-between both Waterloo and Southwark stations. Vauxhall station is also nearby in Vauxhall, situated more towards the South Lambeth area near Kennington as is Oval station nearby. The South West Main Line runs through Lambeth on the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct.

The principal road through the area is Lambeth Road (the A3203). Lambeth Walk adjoins Lambeth Road. The current Lambeth Bridge opened on 19 July 1932. It replaced an earlier suspension bridge which itself was built between 1862 and 1928, but was eventually closed and demolished following the 1928 Thames flood.

It was formed in October, 1940 at Meerut in India and assigned to the 8th Indian Infantry Division. It was then detached for independent duties in Abadan in Persia. In June 1942 the 18th Brigade, having been rushed over to North Africa from Mosul, and was attached to the 10th Indian Infantry Division, had only two days to prepare defensive positions, was overrun by Erwin Rommel's tanks at Deir el Shein in front of the Ruweisat Ridge. In the process, however, they gained valuable time for the rest of the British Eighth Army to organise the defences for what was to be known as the First Battle of El Alamein, halting Rommel's advance towards Egypt. The remnants of the Brigade were then sent to the 5th Indian Infantry Division and the 18th Brigade was officially disbanded in August 1942.

912,3915928,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20American%20Corporation,First American Corporation,"First American Financial Corporation is an American financial services company which provides title insurance and settlement services to the real estate and mortgage industries.

The First American Family of Companies’ core business lines include title insurance and closing/settlement services; title plant management services; title and other real property records and images; valuation products and services; home warranty products; property and casualty insurance; and banking, trust and investment advisory services.
With total revenue of $5.8 billion in 2017, the company offers its products and services directly and through agents.

In June 2010, First American Financial Corporation was established when First American split its businesses to create First American Financial Corporation which provides title and settlement services to the real estate and mortgage industry, and CoreLogic, specializing in real estate information.

Orange County Title Company (1889–1960)

First American traces its roots to 1889, when Orange County, California—a rural, undeveloped area at the time—split off from the county of Los Angeles. Two firms opened to handle title matters in the brand-new county. Five years later, Charles Edward Parker (C.E. Parker), a local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.

Donald Parker Kennedy (D.P. Kennedy), grandson of C.E. Parker, joined Orange County Title in 1948. D.P. Kennedy developed a plan to expand the company beyond Orange County, which was approved by the board of directors in 1957.

First American Title Insurance and Trust Company (1960–1968)

Orange County Title was renamed First American Title Insurance in 1960 to reflect operations beyond Orange County,

D.P. Kennedy was named president of First American Title in 1963, replacing his uncle, George Parker.  First American Title had its initial public offering on the over-the-counter market in 1964 and, four years later, was restructured with the formation of The First American Financial Corporation as a holding company. First American Title became a subsidiary company and a trust business was conducted through First American Trust Company.

The First American Financial Corporation(1968–2000)

 First American expanded its title operations across the nation by opening new offices and acquiring existing title and abstract companies. 
 In 1976, this growth lead to an expansion of the company's Santa Ana headquarters.
 By 1982, First American served all regions of the United States.
 In 1988, First American began to operate internationally with the opening of title insurance offices in Canada.
 First American continued to develop international operations and was the first title insurance provider in Mexico, Korea and Hong Kong, and had the leading market share in Australia and England.

The First American Corporation (2000–2010)

The First American Financial Corporation was renamed The First American Corporation in May 2000 to reflect the expansion of services beyond financial services and title insurance. 
The First American Family of Companies grew to operate within five business segments, including: Title Insurance and Services, Specialty Insurance, Mortgage Information, Property Information, and Risk Mitigation and Business Solutions. First American had approximately 2,100 offices throughout the United States and abroad.

First American Financial Corporation (2010–present)

In June 2010, The First American Corporation split to create two highly focused companies serving the distinct needs of customers across diverse industries. The title insurance and settlement services of The First American Corporation became First American Financial Corporation while the property information and analytics businesses became CoreLogic.

The company continued to be commonly referred to as First American and serves homebuyers and sellers, real estate professionals, loan originators and servicers, commercial property professionals, homebuilders, and others involved in residential and commercial property transactions with products and services specific to their businesses. Those services include title insurance and closing/settlement services; property data, and title plant records and images; home warranties; property and casualty insurance; and banking, trust, and advisory services.

In 2019, it was reported that First American Financial leaked hundreds of millions of documents related to mortgages going back to 2003,
In February 2020, First American announced it agreed to buy Docutech, a document, eSign and compliance technology provider, for $350 million.

Spin-off
June 1, 2010 marked the separation of the First American Corporation's financial services operations and its information solution businesses into two independent public companies. The spin-off was intended to allow First American to focus solely on its core businesses.

As part of a spin-off transaction, First American Financial Corporation common stock was distributed to shareholders of The First American Corporation on June 1, 2010. The shares of both companies traded on a “when-issued” basis from May 24, 2010 through June 1, 2010, and began full-fledged trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 2, 2010; First American Financial Corporation under the ticker symbol FAF.

After the conclusion of his playing career, Bahen became involved in the entertainment and hospitality areas, also serving as a committeeman and vice-president of the South Fremantle Football Club.

Career
Bahen was born at Kiama Hospital, in Wembley, Western Australia, on 17 February 1929, to Clem and Eva (née Beard) Bahen, and grew up in Claremont. His father played 158 games for the Subiaco Football Club, and was later a noted businessman as managing director of C. M. Bahen, Ltd. Bahen attended Aquinas College, and played nine reserves games for South Fremantle in 1949 before moving to Melbourne for his job. There, he began playing with the Mentone Football Club in the Federal Football League, before being recruited by the North Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL), with which he played eight games in the 1951 season before returning to Western Australia, where he began playing in South Fremantle's senior team. Bahen won premierships with South Fremantle in 1952, 1953, and 1954. Playing mainly off a half-back flank, he finished fourth in the Sandover Medal as the fairest and best player in the league in 1954, and also played at centre half-back in Western Australia's interstate game against Victoria. Bahen retired at the end of the 1956 season to concentrate on business interests.

With his wife, Adrian, with whom he later had four children, Bahen took over the running of the P&O Hotel in Fremantle. He later joined the television station TVW as Film Manager in 1961, and later returned to the network to serve as Concessions and Bar Manager at the Perth Entertainment Centre from 1974 to 1977. Bahen remained involved with the South Fremantle Football Club, serving on the club's committee and for a short period as vice-president, as well as organising the Gerry Bahen Classic, an annual fundraising classic.

It consists of Hokkaido's Hidaka and Iburi Subprefectures. As of 2009, 414,438 eligible voters were registered in the district.

Hokkaidō 9th district, like neighboring 8th and 10th district, was considered a ""Democratic kingdom"" (minshu-ōkoku), a stronghold of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). From its creation in 1996 until 2012 it had been represented by DPJ co-founder Yukio Hatoyama. In 2012, Hatoyama retired. The LDP had nominated Hokkaidō prefectural assemblyman and former Olympic speed skater Manabu Horii as their candidate in July 2012.

In the 2000, 2003 and 2005 general elections, the Liberal Democratic Party's candidate was Hirofumi Iwakura, later mayor of Tomakomai, Iburi Subprefecture. In 2000, Iwakura lost the district to Hatoyama by a margin of less than 3,000 votes.

Before the 1994 electoral reform, the area had been part of Hokkaido 4th district where five representatives were elected by single non-transferable vote. Yukio Hatoyama (New Party Sakigake), Tatsuo Takahashi (LDP) and Tomoko Kami (JCP) had already stood as candidates there in 1993.

918,29821670,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable%20Calendar,Invariable Calendar,"In April 1900, Professor L. A. Grosclaude of Geneva proposed the Invariable Calendar, New Era Calendar, or Normal Calendar with 12 months and four 91-day quarters of exactly 13 weeks. An additional day, termed New Year's Day, that was not any day of the week and not part of any month, would occur between December 31 and January 1. Another such day is inserted between June 31 and July 1 on leap years.

This model would be a perennial calendar, with each date occurring perennially on the same day of the week. Grosclaude lists many business advantages to this. Three monthly days important to businesses, the 1st, 15th, and 30th would always occur on the same 3 days of the week, respectively, and additionally would never occur on a Sunday, for example. It became the model for The World Calendar, promoted by Elisabeth Acheils and The World Calendar Association since 1930.

Proposed Calendar

Criticism 
 The Sabbatarian objection, that the strict cycle of the seven-day week is interrupted; sometimes there are seven days between sabbaths, instead of the usual six.
 Difficulties of defining the dates of New Year's and Leap Days when they don't belong to any month or week.

926,41557739,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt%20cross,Basalt cross,"The basalt cross () is a particular type of stone cross found  in the Eifel mountains of Germany and bears witness to the piety of the local population in times past. These crosses indicate their beliefs and superstitions as well as the wealth and standing of the people who erected them. Details such as accidents, occupations and prayer requests have survived, thanks to the extremely weather-resistant material of which the crosses are made. Their geographic distribution is centred on the basalt quarries of Mayen and Mendig, and covers an area with a radius of approximately 30 kilometres between the Rhine, Ahr and Moselle rivers. The exact number of monuments is not known. Local historian, Kurt Müller-Veltin, estimates that there are about 4,500 wayside crosses and about 6,000 grave crosses. The conservation of these monuments is undertaken by the Rhenisch Society for Monument Conservation (Rheinische Verein für Denkmalpflege).

Early examples 
Wayside monuments known as Schöpflöffel (""ladle"") due to their shape, appeared up to the 16th century. The Nischenstock (""niche post"") was derived from it but a cross was added above the niche.

Dating 
The earliest monuments date to 1461; their benefactor was Clais Beligen.

Blessing stones 
Some crosses were erected as ""blessing stones"" and had niches carved in them to hold the Blessed Sacrament (the host) during services as part of outdoor processions.

Grave crosses 
Particularly impressive grave crosses from the 18th century have survived in Mayschoß and in Dümpelfeld. On one side is the image of Christ with various symbols; on the other there is an inscription with details of the deceased.

Protection, defence and atonement 
In the Early and High Middle Ages crosses were understood to provide protection from lightning, hail and other natural catastrophes. Atonement crosses were also erected in some places to provide satisfaction following murders and other serious crimes. Even unusual accidents were often a reason to put up a cross.

Inscriptions and house marks 
The inscriptions are usually in German with dialectical influences. Years were given in Roman numerals to begin with, but later Arabic numerals were used. A commonly used abbreviation was D.S.G.G. which meant Der Seele Gott Gnade (""God have mercy on the soul""). The photograph shows an example of maximum economy in inscription writing e.g. MARIA

House marks are signs and ownership symbols of the clans or noble families. These marks may be used to work out when the deceased or donor lived.

Workshops 
Originally the crosses were not produced in special workshops, but were by products of other stonemason businesses. Around 1630 specialist cross workshops emerged and crosses can usually be classified from the inscription style of the stonemason.

Material 
Strictly speaking, the lava rock that was used from the quarries between Mayen and Mendig was not basalt, but a so-called tephrite lava. This scientific distinction did not make its way into every speech, however, as formerly all black, volcanic rock was described here as ""basalt"". The rock is relatively easy to work thanks to its coarse pores, but so weather-resistant that it survives for centuries without being significantly affected.

A skilled attacking midfielder, he was considered one of the best Portuguese players of his generation, and earned the nickname Luvas Pretas from the black gloves he used to wear while playing following in the style of his grandfather Carlos Alves.

During his career he represented mainly, with equal individual and team success, Benfica and Boavista, also coaching the latter club on three separate occasions.

Playing career

Club
Born in Albergaria-a-Velha, Aveiro District, Alves started playing at youth level for A.D. Sanjoanense, being recruited in 1969 by S.L. Benfica. His first professional team was Varzim S.C. in the 1972–73 season followed by C.D. Montijo, the latter being his Primeira Liga experience.

Alves moved to his first major club, Boavista FC, for the 1974–75 campaign, where he first showed more of his talent, earning him a transfer to Spain's UD Salamanca where he remained two more years. He then returned to Portugal and Benfica, only to move after one year to Paris Saint-Germain FC.

Failing to impress in France, Alves immediately moved back to the Estádio da Luz, where he would play for the next three seasons. He then re-joined Boavista, ending his career during 1984–85 at the age of 32 to become the latter team's coach.

Alves won two national championships for Benfica (1981 and 1983) and four Portuguese Cups (two for Boavista, in 1975 and 1976, and two with the former side, in 1981 and 1983). He also played for them in the 1982–83 UEFA Cup final, losing on aggregate to R.S.C. Anderlecht of Belgium.

International
Alves won 36 caps for Portugal (11 for Boavista, eight for Salamanca and 17 for Benfica), scoring three goals. His debut took place on 13 November 1974 in a 0–3 friendly loss to Switzerland, and his final match was on 27 April 1983, in a 0–5 loss against the Soviet Union for the UEFA Euro 1984 qualifiers.

|}

Coaching career
Alves became a coach after finishing his player career, managing Boavista on three separate occasions, C.F. Estrela da Amadora (leading the Amadora team to an historical 1990 Cup of Portugal triumph), Vitória de Guimarães, C.F. Os Belenenses, Salamanca, S.C. Campomaiorense, S.C. Farense, Académica de Coimbra and Leixões SC. In 1996–97, he was one of three managers as former side Salamanca returned to La Liga after a second-place finish.

After three years out of coaching, he returned to Benfica in 2007, to be in charge of its under-18 team. Two years later he returned to senior football, signing with Switzerland's Servette FC and achieving promotion to the Super League in his second season.

On 28 November 2011, following Swiss Cup elimination at the hands of FC Biel-Bienne (0–3 away loss), Alves was relieved of his duties. However, following poor results achieved by his successor and the club's takeover by Hugh Quennec, he was reinstated as manager in April 2012: in the final five games of the campaign results improved, with the team achieving four wins and one draw – this included a 2–1 win over eventual champions FC Basel, which ended Servette's streak of 17 consecutive defeats against that opponent as well as ending their 26-match unbeaten run – and the side eventually qualified for the UEFA Europa League.

On 9 October 2018, after six years of inactivity, Alves returned for another spell as Académica coach, with the club now in the LigaPro. He left at the end of the season, and came back to management on 9 January 2020 with C.D. Cova da Piedade, last-placed in the same league. They were relegated in May when the campaign was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and he openly attacked the Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional for the decision.

His jumper was number 43 and played in the reserves during the first season at the club, and most of his second season, before breaking into the side for a debut late in the year. He played 36 games in 1998 at half-back, normally a receiving player, yet he played the game hard. His played well under pressure and was a great at being able to get the ball in most situations. In 1999 he had a good season statistically, playing consistent football, averaging 16 disposals a game, but with the side not performing, he was part of a process which Mick Malthouse adopted in re-constructing the side, surprising most when Godden was delisted.

931,57440262,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson%20Weavers%27%20Association,Nelson Weavers' Association,"The Nelson Weavers' Association (NWA) was a trade union representing cotton weavers in the area of Nelson, Lancashire.  As the main industry in the town, the union has been influential in its history, and some of its leaders became significant national figures.

History
Although there was a weavers' union in Nelson by 1860, this appears to have dissolved, and was replaced by the Nelson and District Power-Loom Weavers' Association in 1870.  This was initially a branch of the North East Lancashire Amalgamated Weavers' Association, but it soon adopted an independent existence, affiliating to the Amalgamated Weavers' Association (AWA) on its formation in 1884, and leaving the first amalgamation in 1892.

By 1884, the union only 400 members, but this steadily grew, as the union saw success.  In 1891, it won the right to collective bargaining with employers.  The following year, it undertook its first strike, in protest at two overlookers named Evans and Berry, who were sexually harassing women members.  Following the action, employers offered that the overlookers would only work mornings, a deal the union leadership was willing to agree, but members voted to reject this.  Evans and Berry then took the union to a tribunal, but lost, and then left the area.

The Nelson union was one of the first larger cotton industry unions to support independent labour representation.  It stood its first independent candidate in a local election in 1890, and over the course of the decade, both the Social Democratic Federation and the Independent Labour Party gained much support from union members and influence in its activities.  The union was a founder member of the Labour Representation Committee and, thanks to the union's backing, Labour held a majority on the town council from 1905.  It was largely as a result of the union's efforts that cotton trade unionist David Shackleton was elected as the local Member of Parliament at the Clitheroe by-election, 1902.

Membership of the union reached 4,000 in 1892, and more than 12,000 by 1910, peaking at 18,000 in 1920.  In 1912, 420 Catholic members split away to form the rival Nelson and District Weavers' Protection Society.  The association struck in opposition to their continued employment, but this was resolved when employers offered compensatory payments to association members.  The Protection Society steadily lost members until it was dissolved, in 1921, the few remaining members rejoining the association.

In 1911, union collectors went on strike after their take was reduced.  This was resolved by the union founding a separate insurance society, offering new opportunities for the collectors to increase their income.

From 1920, the local cotton industry entered a long decline.  The AWA and the United Textile Factory Workers' Association agreed wage reductions in 1921, an action which the Nelson Weavers opposed.  There followed a number of disputes.  In 1928, union members at Mather Brothers mill struck over the sacking of John Husband, the vice-president of the union.  This led to a seven-week lock-out at mills across the town.  The AWA did not support the locked-out workers, and they failed to get Husband re-appointed, although the union felt that the action led to improved conditions for workers more generally.  In 1931, the union took part in the AWA strike over workers being asked to manage more looms.  The union felt that the AWA was too keen to settle the action and, on a proposal of ILP members, sent its own delegation to meet with Arthur Greenwood and ILP Members of Parliament.  This succeeded in getting the proposal abandoned, but it emerged again the following year and was then agreed by the AWA.

Despite a gradual decline in membership, by 1935 the union was the largest affiliate of the AWA, and by 1941 it retained 10,000 members.  In 1960, the union was renamed as the Nelson and District Weavers' Association.  Membership had fallen to only 3,000 in 1964, and in 1966, it merged with the Burnley and District Weavers', Winders' and Beamers' Association, forming the Burnley, Nelson and District Textile Workers' Union.

Licata is a historical Sicilian team, and one of the six Sicilian football clubs to have ever reached the Serie B league in Italian football history.

The club currently plays in Serie D.

History
The club was founded in 1931 as Associazione Calcio Licata by a few local students who discovered the game of association football thanks to some Swedish sailors who worked in the area; the official team colours, in fact, refer to the flag of Sweden. The club was renamed Polisportiva Licata in 1967.

The first appearance of Licata in a professional league, is dated in 1982 within Serie C2. During the 1984–85 season, Licata, coached by a young Zdeněk Zeman, won Serie C2 and promoted to Serie C1, despite a team composed almost entirely by players from the youth squad.

In 1988, with Aldo Cerantola as coach, Licata won also Serie C1/B, and were promoted to Serie B for the first time ever in the club's history. During its first season in the Italian second division, with Giuseppe Papadopulo as coach, then replaced by Francesco Scorsa, Licata ended in ninth place; finishing above Parma. They also achieved the honour of playing a Coppa Italia match at the Stadio San Siro against AC Milan.

The following season however, Licata were relegated to Serie C1 after finishing in 18th position. A couple of seasons later, in 1991–92 they were relegated down to Serie C2. They were then relegated in the 1992–94 season, and were set to compete in the CND league, but slow decay for the Sicilian club was complete and they became bankrupt in 1994.

Refoundation
A new club, Licata AC, was then founded and admitted to the regional Eccellenza league. But in 1996, after having daringly avoided relegation, Licata AC did not register to Eccellenza and was cancelled too; a new team, Santos Licata (then Nuovo Licata, that finally switched to the current denomination), started from Promozione (7th level in the Italian football league system).

During the 2005–06 season, Licata won the round A of Sicilian Eccellenza, consequently returning to Serie D for the first time for a decade.

In the season 2010–11 it was promoted from Eccellenza Sicily group A to Serie D.

Colors and badge
The traditional club colours of Licata is yellow and blue; known in Italy as gialloblu. The club has two other nicknames; I Santi which means The Saints, and I Falchi which translates as The Hawks.

Three home games were played on campus in Pullman at Rogers Field, with one in Spokane in late September.

The Cougars defeated rival Washington for the second straight year, but were shut out at home by neighbor Idaho in the Battle of the Palouse, which was the Vandals' first win in the series in 29 years, since their three-peat in 1925.

The Washington rivalry game (now the Apple Cup) was held in Pullman for the first time since 1948 and was the last until 1982; all three were Cougar victories.

937,4396231,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/714-X,714-X,"714-X, also referred to as 714X or trimethylbicyclonitramineoheptane chloride, is a mixture of substances manufactured by CERBE Distribution Inc and sold as an alternative medical treatment which is claimed to cure cancer, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia and other diseases. There is no scientific evidence that 714-X is effective in treating any kind of cancer, and its marketing is considered health fraud in the US.

History 
714-X was developed by Gaston Naessens, a native of France and tried there for practicing medicine without a license. Naessens moved to Quebec and continued his research from the early 1970s. In 1989 he was arrested but acquitted from charges of accessory to murder, after a cancer patient using 714-X died following refusal to take conventional medical treatment.

The name ""714-X"" was chosen by Naessens to symbolize his initials (the 7th and 14th letters of the alphabet) and the year of his birth (1924, as X is the 24th letter). The marketers claim that 714-X works by counteracting the harm done by ""somatids"", a purported life form which is not bacterial, viral, or fungal, but which instead belongs to a distinct domain unknown to science and medicine.

Sales of 714-X have been banned in the US by the Food and Drug Administration, and in 1996 Charles Pixley was tried and jailed for advocating and distributing it. During proceedings Pixley claimed it was the re-branding of a homeopathic beverage, known prior to the establishment of the FDA, however Naessens later said that it was completely different and has nothing to do with homeopathy.

Composition
714-X is advertised as containing camphor combined with excess nitrogen, ammonium salts, sodium chloride, and ethanol. An analysis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that 714-X was 94% water, with small amounts of the other salts and less than 0.01% camphor.

Administration
714-X is typically injected into the lymphatic system through the groin. Alternatively, it may be inhaled via a nebulizer.

Safety and effectiveness
No studies have been published on the safety or efficacy of 714-X in humans, and the few available animal studies have shown no beneficial effect.  The American Cancer Society has stated: ""There is no scientific evidence that 714-X is effective in treating any type of cancer or any other illness.""

Legal issues
The FDA has banned both importation and sale of 714-X as health fraud, and at least one prison sentence has been handed down for importing it into America.

714-X is manufactured in Canada, where it is legal to purchase for personal use through a physician under the Special Access Programme of Health Canada, a law which provides access to non-marketed treatments for terminal illnesses when no marketed alternative exists. However, in October 2004, Health Canada told the manufacturer to remove all references to the compound from its website. On July 28, 2006, Justice François Lemieux of the Federal Court of Canada granted a request for judicial review undertaken by a group of 714-X patients. The judgment voided Health Canada's policy statement and restored access to 714-X under the Special Access Programme under certain conditions.

History
The hospital, which was designed by John McCurdy, was opened as the Cavan and Monaghan District Lunatic Asylum in 1869. Two chapels were built, one for catholic patients and the other for protestant patients, and these were renovated by William Alphonsus Scott in 1910.

The Irish republican, Peadar O'Donnell, was regarded as the first Irish person to use the term ""occupation"" in relation to the occupation of a workplace, when he and the staff of the hospital occupied the site in 1919. ""The occupation was, in fact, the first action in Ireland to describe itself as a soviet, and the Red Flag was raised above the hospital."" It became Monaghan Mental Hospital in the late 1920s and  St. Davnet's Hospital in the 1950s.

After the introduction of deinstitutionalisation in the late 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline and activities became focused on Blackwater House.

943,54287201,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack%20Posobiec,Jack Posobiec,"John Michael Posobiec III ( ; born December 14, 1985) is an American alt-right and alt-lite political activist, television correspondent and presenter, conspiracy theorist, and provocateur. Posobiec is best known for his pro-Donald Trump comments on Twitter, as well as using white supremacist and antisemitic symbols and talking points, including the white genocide conspiracy theory. He has repeatedly planted false and derogatory claims about political figures in an effort to damage his opponents. He has promoted fake news, including the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory claiming high-ranking Democratic Party officials were involved in a child sex ring. From 2018 to 2021, Posobiec was employed by One America News Network (OANN), a far-right cable news television channel, as a political correspondent and on-air presenter. He left OANN in May 2021 to begin hosting a show for the conservative student organization Turning Point USA, and to join conservative news site Human Events as a senior editor.

Early life and career
Posobiec was born and raised in Norristown, Pennsylvania, to a family of Polish descent. His parents were both Democrats. He attended Kennedy-Kenrick Catholic High School and went to college at Temple University. While at Temple, he became the chairman of the Temple University College Republicans and started a chapter of Students for Academic Freedom, an organization run by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. He also participated in a summer internship for U.S. Senator Rick Santorum and volunteered for U.S. Representative Curt Weldon's unsuccessful reelection campaign in 2006. He graduated from Temple in 2006 with a double major in political science and broadcast journalism.

After graduation, Posobiec worked for the United States Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, China. He played a minor role in the film The Forbidden Kingdom, which was released in 2008. He later worked for WPHT, a conservative talk radio station, and then for the campaign of Steve Johnson in the 2010 Pennsylvania lieutenant gubernatorial election.

Posobiec served several tours in the United States Navy Reserve from 2010 to 2017, reaching the rank of lieutenant junior grade. He was deployed for ten months at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base from September 2012, and worked at the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), where he later worked again as a civilian.

During the 2016 election, Posobiec was a special projects director of Citizens for Trump, a pro-Trump organization but not an official group. In March 2017, Posobiec resigned from his full-time civilian position at ONI, saying that his support for Trump led to a ""toxic work environment"". As of August 2017, his security clearance was suspended and was under review.

Political activities
Posobiec describes himself as a ""Republican political operative"". During the 2016 election, Posobiec was a special projects director of the political organization Citizens for Trump.

He said in 2017 that his work was ""reality journalism—part investigative, part activist, part commentary"", and that ""I'm willing to break the fourth wall. I'm willing to walk into an anti-Trump march and start chanting anti-Clinton stuff—to make something happen, and then cover what happens."" Will Sommer, an editor at The Hill, said in 2017 that Posobiec ""make[s] stuff up, relentlessly"", and that ""there's no one at that level.""

On June 16, 2017, Posobiec disrupted a Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar that depicted the title character as a Trump-like figure. Posobiec was prompted by Mike Cernovich, another alt-right conspiracy theorist, who had offered a $1,000 prize for anyone who interrupted a performance. ""You are all Goebbels, you are all Nazis like Joseph Goebbels"", he shouted at the audience in a video he posted on Twitter. Posobiec was escorted from the event along with another protester, Laura Loomer, who was arrested for disorderly conduct after refusing to leave the stage.

Posobiec has supported other conservative political figures with similar tactics. He promoted e-mails and files leaked to 4chan of Emmanuel Macron shortly before the French presidential election in 2017. In a video shot for Rebel Media, he promoted the candidacy of Marine Le Pen of the National Front. Posobiec celebrated the Macron leak at a party hosted by Milo Yiannopoulos. In October 2017, Posobiec and Cernovich formed a super PAC called #Rev18 and announced its support for Josh Mandel in the 2018 U.S. Senate election in Ohio. In July 2017, Posobiec handed out flyers thanking Democratic senators for ""protecting our quality violent porn content"", including ""ritual Satanic porn videos"". The flyers were distributed outside the U.S. Senate at a demonstration in support of net neutrality.

Posobiec organized a ""Rally Against Political Violence"" in Washington, D.C., on June 25, 2017, to condemn the shooting of Steve Scalise. Richard Spencer, another alt-right figure who organized a separate, competing rally at the same time, ridiculed Posobiec's event and called it ""pathetic"". In November 2017, Posobiec encouraged his Twitter followers to target a woman at her workplace after she came forward with allegations that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore had attempted to have sex with her when she was 14 years old. In Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district special election in March 2018, Posobiec supported Democrat Conor Lamb over Republican Rick Saccone. Posobiec described Lamb as a ""Pro-Trump Dem veteran"".

Posobiec's social media and political activities are linked to white supremacist movements. He has published multiple posts containing the white supremacist code ""1488"", or the Fourteen Words, and supports the use of the slogan. In October 2016, Posobiec posted a tweet that included triple parentheses, an antisemitic symbol. In response to a 2017 Anti-Defamation League report on the alt-right, which included Posobiec, he tweeted a selfie of his visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial in Poland: ""The @ADL_National would be wise to remember what happened the last time people made lists of undesirables"".

In August 2017, following the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that led to violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-protesters, Posobiec said that the rally had become ""massive propaganda"" for the left and that the mainstream media was ""fanning the flames of this violence."" He said that Trump should have disavowed Black Lives Matter. Posobiec later tweeted that he had consistently disavowed white nationalism and violence. He also tweeted that he was ""done with trolling"" and that it was ""time to do the right thing."" Posobiec has frequently tweeted about the racist and discredited white genocide conspiracy theory.

In June 2020, in Washington, D.C.'s Lincoln Park, Posobiec was shoved and chased for several minutes by a dozen protesters at the Emancipation Memorial. The protesters called Posobiec, who was filming speakers, a Nazi and forced him from the park. Police arrived in a van and, after trying to quell the fracas, helped Posobiec into the van before driving away. Posobiec tweeted later that he was ""totally fine"" but ""filing an assault report with DC police"".

Media work
Posobiec was employed from early April 2017 to May 2017 by Rebel News, a far-right Canada-based website, as its Washington bureau chief, and was granted press access to the White House in April 2017. According to Philadelphia magazine, Posobiec ""seem[ed] to have been charged in the press briefing room with haranguing legitimate journalists and running out the clock on press conferences with inane softball questions and Dear Leader obsequiousness"" during his short time in the White House press pool.

In May 2017, Posobiec hired neo-Nazi brothers Jeffrey and Edward Clark to help create a documentary about the murder of Seth Rich for Rebel News. Jeffrey Clark was arrested by the FBI on gun charges after saying that the Jewish victims of the October 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting ""deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse"". Posobiec later said that he had never heard of Jeffrey Clark and had never made a documentary about Seth Rich, even though HuffPost published photographs of Posobiec and the Clarks working together. He left Rebel News after allegations were made that he had engaged in plagiarism.

From 2018 to 2021, One America News Network (OANN), a far-right cable news television channel, employed Posobiec as a political correspondent and on-air presenter. In September 2018, he presented the pro-Hitler online poster known as Microchip on the network without indicating that person's affiliations, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC said the two men had worked together in spreading disinformation for several years, including the false claims propagated in Pizzagate.

Posobiec left OANN in May 2021 to begin hosting a show for the conservative student organization Turning Point USA, and to join Human Events as a senior editor.

Conspiracy theories, falsehoods, and unsubstantiated claims
Posobiec has promoted many falsehoods, leading to Philadelphia calling him the ""King of Fake News"" in 2017. He was one of the most prominent promoters on social media of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which falsely claimed that high-ranking officials were involved in a child-sex ring centered at a Washington, D.C. pizzeria. He live-streamed an investigation of the pizzeria and was asked to leave after attempting to broadcast a child's birthday party being held in a back room. Posobiec later said he had always thought the Pizzagate theory was ""stupid"" and had filmed his visit to debunk it.

Posobiec attempted to discredit anti-Trump protesters in November 2016 by planting a sign at a protest reading ""Rape Melania"". Posobiec denied his involvement to BuzzFeed News, but the same phone number was used in his contact with the website and the text messages he reputedly sent. He said he had been questioned about it by the Secret Service. Posobiec organized the DeploraBall, an event held on January 19, 2017, to celebrate Trump's inauguration.

In December 2016, Posobiec claimed without evidence that Disney had re-written scenes in the Star Wars movie Rogue One to add ""Anti Trump scenes calling him a racist"", and called for a boycott of the Star Wars franchise. Disney denied the allegations.

Posobiec falsely said that former FBI director James Comey, at a United States Senate hearing on May 17, 2017, ""said under oath that Trump did not ask him to halt any investigation"". The claim was later repeated by conservative personalities and media outlets, including Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and the InfoWars website. Posobiec promoted the discredited conspiracy theory that Seth Rich had leaked e-mails from the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks. Posobiec promoted a hoax that CNN had published and then deleted an article defending Bill Maher's use of a racial slur.

In June 2017, shortly after Republican congressman Steve Scalise was shot and injured during a baseball practice, along with four others, Posobiec tweeted that it was a terrorist attack and blamed comments from liberal anti-Trump individuals. Later, he falsely tweeted that former United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch had called for ""blood in the streets"" the previous March and that Bernie Sanders had ordered his followers to ""take down"" Trump.

In December 2017, Posobiec, along with Cernovich, The Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars, promoted a false theory that a passenger train derailment near Dupont, Washington, was linked to the Antifa anti-fascism movement. 

In October 2019, after Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a White House national security official and decorated Iraq war veteran, testified in Congress about President Trump requesting that the Ukrainian President investigate his political rival Joe Biden, Posobiec falsely claimed that Vindman had been advising the Ukrainian government on ways to prevent Trump from implementing his foreign policy goals.

In June 2020, during the protests against racism and police brutality in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, Posobiec falsely claimed that there were pipe bombs planted at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. and that ""federal assets [were] in pursuit"". There were no pipe bombs nor was there any evidence that any ""federal assets"" investigated. The claim was, however picked up by The Gateway Pundit and retweeted by over 29,000 users on Twitter.

Personal life
From 2012 to 2016, Posobiec ran a blog and podcast about Game of Thrones called AngryGoTFan. Posobiec married in November 2017 and has two sons.

944,37803904,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene%20Turenne%20Gregorie,Eugene Turenne Gregorie,"Eugene Turenne Gregorie (also E. T. ""Bob"" Gregorie, Eugene T. ""Bob"" Gregorie; pronounced ""GREG-ree""; 1908–2002) was an American yacht designer and automobile designer. Gregorie and Edsel Ford worked closely together to design many automobiles of the 1930s and 1940s. Although he was a high school dropout he became the head of Ford's automobile design department. He returned to yacht design after retirement.

Early life and family 

Gregorie was born in Hempstead, Nassau, Long Island, New York, as Eugene T. Gregorie Jr. on October 12, 1908. Gregorie's parents were Eugene Turenne Gregorie and Alva Palmer Gregorie. Gregorie was the first-born son and was nicknamed 'Bob' to distinguish him from his father.

Gregorie's ancestors came from Scotland and immigrated to Virginia in the eighteenth century. His ancestors were merchants trading in slaves and products from the United Kingdom. Gregorie's father was a successful entrepreneur with investments in the stock market. Gregorie's mother was an accomplished painter.

Education
The 1925 New York State Census shows that when Gregorie was 17 years old he was still living in Long Island, New York, with his parents. After high school, Gregorie attended private schools in Virginia for higher education. The 1940 U.S. Census shows that when he was 32 years old he resided in Grosse Ile Township, Michigan and in 1935 in Dearborn, Michigan.

Career

Yacht design 
Gregorie started his design career in 1926 at Elco Works, a New Jersey yacht-building company when he was a high school dropout.  His supervisor at the company was William Fleming, chief architect. After working there for about a year he left that firm and went to work for Cox & Stevens, a yacht designing firm in downtown Manhattan. He worked for them until the fall of 1928.

Automobile design 
Gregorie started his automobile design work at Brewster & Company, an automobile body design company, in late 1928 and worked there for about a year. He then went to Detroit and worked a few months at General Motors under the chief designer Harley Earl in the Art and Colour design department. Due to the Great Depression and the poor economy that followed, he was laid off since he was a new hire. He then tried to get a job at the Lincoln Motor Company in Detroit, but they were not hiring at the time. Gregorie obtained various odd jobs related to yachts for much of 1930. He spent the winter of 1930 with his family in a South Carolina cottage.

Gregorie received a telegram at the end of December 1930 from Lincoln Motor Company's chief body engineer saying they needed an automobile body designer; the directive came from Edsel Ford who was in charge of Lincoln Motor Company. The telegram read Report at Ford Motor Company Engineering Laboratory, Dearborn. Confident he could do automotive design quite well, Gregorie traveled to Dearborn, Michigan, which took him several days. Edsel Ford hired him in early 1931 at age twenty-two. His first assignment was to design a Ford automobile for the European market, which became the Model Y.

Gregorie's personality harmonized with Edsel Ford (son of Henry Ford), and their close relationship combined with his own professional skills in automotive design led to him becoming the head of Ford's design department in 1935. Gregorie was a designer of the 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr, which had a design concept based on the 1934 Pioneer Zephyr streamliner train, also referred to as the Burlington Zephyr. The 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr car was called ""the first successfully streamlined car in America"" by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Gregorie was ultimately given the accolade of being the ""grand old man"" of Ford car design.

In 1938 Edsel Ford wanted a ""special little sports car"" for pleasure driving at his estate in Florida for the winter of 1939. Gregorie is known to have told biographers that in September 1938 it took him less than an hour to sketch the first Lincoln Continental using as a template the 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr blueprints.

As Jim Farrell, a writer about Ford design history, summarized: ""Gregorie's primary attribute was he could translate what Edsel Ford wanted into three-dimensional designs. ... He could sit and sketch while Edsel talked in his office.""

The Ford engineers were amazed that Gregorie could talk about the mechanical abilities of an automobile as well as he could design a car. Gregorie attributed this ability to his naval architecture experience.

Highlights of his career at Ford included: the Lincoln-Zephyr blueprint for a two-door cabriolet; the first Mercury, the 1940 and 1941 Fords; a killed-in-the-womb ""small"" post-war Ford; and a concept 1939 Lincoln Continental; and a concept for the 1949 Ford (which was won by George W. Walker, who had been hired by ""Whiz Kid"" Ernest Breech.

Retirement and death 
Gregorie retired from Ford Motor Company in 1946 when he was only 38 years old, mainly because he did not get along with the new management after Edsel Ford died in 1943. Gregorie designed a Mercury prior to Edsel's death  the last car approved by Edsel  which was produced as the 1949 Mercury.

Gregorie retired to St. Augustine, Florida, after leaving Ford Motor Company. There he resumed designing yachts. He died December 1, 2002. His wife Evelyn outlived him.

946,55876390,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne%20Shymer,Anne Shymer,"Anne Shymer, born Anne C. Justice (May 30, 1879 in Logansport, Cass County, Indiana – May 7, 1915 in North Atlantic) was an American chemist and the president of the United States Chemical Company.

Early life
Anne C. Justice was born at Logansport, Indiana, the daughter of James Monroe Justice and Grace Heikes Justice (later Grace Justice-Hankins). Her father was a lawyer and politician in Indiana. Her older sister Maibelle Heikes Justice became a novelist and screenwriter. Anne attended Cornell University.

Career 

Shymer achieved her biggest success as a chemist and founded the United States Chemical Corporation. Among other things, she discovered a bleach for textiles and a germicidal substance that could be used especially in hospitals. Her achievements brought her recognition and prestige; shortly afterwards, she enjoyed world-wide attention. Shymer received an invitation from Britain's prime minister H. H. Asquith and his wife. In 1915, King George V.'s Physician heard of Shymer's accomplishments and was impressed.

Death on the Lusitania 
On May 1, 1915, Shymer boarded the British luxury liner RMS Lusitania, which was supposed to travel from New York to Liverpool, England. She was going to be introduced at St James to King George and Queen Mary of England. Apart from that, she also wanted to establish new contacts and patent her newest formulae. Before she departed, she wanted to proceed with the divorce of her husband but was hindered because she didn't know where he currently was. On the day of her departure, her mother, her sister Maibelle Justice and other relatives came to Pier 54 to say good bye. Because the departure took longer than expected, her family took a last picture of Shymer. This picture, in which she is smiling and props her left arm self-confidently on the railing on the B-Deck promenade, is one of the most popular pictures associated with the Lusitania catastrophe.

Six days later, in the early afternoon of May 7, 1915, Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine boat U2 0 with a torpedo. The ship sank within a few minutes and took two-thirds of the passengers and crew with it. Shymer was able to get to her cabin B-98 and take her jewelry, that she wore completely in order to not lose it. What happened to her afterwards is unknown. Her corpse was one of the first found and received the number #66. The jewelry that she wore was worth about US$4000 in 1915. On its way back from Ireland to the American embassy in London, the jewelry vanished and has not been seen since. Shymer's dead body was returned to her family in the United States.

Personal life 
Anne Justice married twice. Her first husband was an Englishman named Patterson; she was widowed when he died. Her second short-lived marriage was to Robert Delno Shimer (she preferred a variant spelling of the surname); they married and were separated in 1911. Anne died at sea when the Lusitania was sunk; she was 36 years old. She was traveling with almost $4000 worth of jewelry, which was retrieved but soon lost in transit to the American Embassy in London. Her mother's estate and her sister received some damages from the German government for her lost belongings.

Shymer's husband, as well as her mother and sister, sued the Cunard Line for compensation, because of the loss of their relative. Robert Shimer's lawsuit was dropped because he had been living apart from his wife for four years. Grace and Maibelle Justice's lawsuit was settled in October 1925, more than ten years after the incident. Shymer's mother was already dead at that point in time. Maibelle Heikes Justice got US$7,527.

948,45770,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylos,Pylos,"Pylos (, ; ), historically also known as Navarino, is a town and a former municipality in Messenia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform, it has been part of the municipality Pylos-Nestoras, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It was the capital of the former Pylia Province. It is the main harbour on the Bay of Navarino. Nearby villages include Gialova, Pyla, Elaiofyto, Schinolakka, and Palaionero. The town of Pylos has 2,345 inhabitants, the municipal unit of Pylos 5,287 (2011). The municipal unit has an area of 143.911 km2.

Pylos has been inhabited since Neolithic times. It was a significant kingdom in Mycenaean Greece, with remains of the so-called ""Palace of Nestor"" excavated nearby, named after Nestor, the king of Pylos in Homer's Iliad. In Classical times, the site was uninhabited, but became the site of the Battle of Pylos in 425 BC, during the Peloponnesian War. After that, Pylos is scarcely mentioned until the 13th century, when it became part of the Frankish Principality of Achaea. Increasingly known by its French name of Port-de-Jonc or its Italian name Navarino, in the 1280s the Franks built the Old Navarino castle on the site. Pylos came under the control of the Republic of Venice from 1417 until 1500, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans used Pylos and its bay as a naval base, and built the New Navarino fortress there. The area remained under Ottoman control, with the exception of a brief period of renewed Venetian rule in 1685–1715 and a Russian occupation in 1770–71, until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821. Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt recovered it for the Ottomans in 1825, but the defeat of the Turco-Egyptian fleet in the 1827 Battle of Navarino and the French military intervention of the 1828 Morea expedition forced Ibrahim to withdraw from the Peloponnese and confirmed Greek independence. The current city was built outside the fortress walls by the military engineers of the Morea expedition from 1829 and the name Pylos was revived by royal decree in 1833.

Name

Pylos retained its ancient name into Byzantine times, but after the Frankish conquest in the early 13th century, two new names appear:
 a French one, Port-de-Jonc (""Rush Harbour"") or Port-de-Junch, with some variants and derivatives: in Italian Porto-Junco, Zunchio or Zonchio, in medieval Catalan Port Jonc, in Latin Iuncum, Zonglon/Zonglos (Ζόγγλον/ς or Ζόγκλον/ς) in Greek, etc. It takes that name from the marshes surrounding the place.
 a Greek one, Avarinos (Ἀβαρῖνος), later shortened to Varinos (Βαρῖνος) or lengthened to Anavarinos (Ἀναβαρῖνος) by epenthesis, which became Navarino in Italian (probably by rebracketing) and Navarin in French. Its etymology is not certain. A traditional etymology, proposed by the early 15th-century traveller Nompar de Caumont and repeated as late as the works of Karl Hopf, ascribed the name to the Navarrese Company, but that is clearly an error since the name was in use long before the Navarrese presence in Greece. In 1830, Fallmereyer proposed that it could originate from a body of Avars who settled there, a view adopted by a few later scholars like William Miller. Modern scholarship, on the other hand, considers it more likely that it originates from a Slavic name meaning ""place of maples"". The name of Avarinos/Navarino, although in use before the Frankish period, came into widespread use and eclipsed the French name of Port-de-Jonc and its derivations only in the 15th century, after the collapse of the Frankish Principality of Achaea.

In the late 14th or early 15th century, when it was held by the Navarrese Company, it was also known as Château Navarres, and called Spanochori (Σπανοχώρι, ""village of the Spaniards"") by the local Greeks.

Under Ottoman rule (1498–1685, 1715–1821), the Turkish name was Anavarin[o] (آناوارين). After the construction of the new Ottoman fortress (Anavarin kalesi) in 1571/2, it became known as Neokastro (Νεόκαστρο or Νιόκαστρο, ""new castle"") among the local Greeks, while the old Frankish castle became known as Palaiokastro (Παλαιόκαστρο or Παλιόκαστρο, ""old castle"").

History

Neolithic Pylos
The region of Pylos has a long history, which goes hand in hand with that of Peloponnese. It starts in the depths of prehistory, as the region has been inhabited since the Neolithic, when populations from Anatolia began to spread in the Balkans and Greece around 6500 BC, bringing with them the practice of agriculture and farming. Excavations have demonstrated a continuous human presence from the Late Neolithic period (5300 BC) on several sites of Pylia, in particular in those of Voidokilia and of Nestor's cave, where numerous ostraca or fragments of painted, black and polished ceramics have been found, as well as later engraved and written pottery. The Neolithic period ended with the appearance of bronze metallurgy around 3000 BC.

Mycenaean Pylos 

During the Bronze Age (3000–1000 BC), the Mycenaean civilization developed, particularly in Peloponnese. Pylos then became the capital of one of the most important human centers of this civilization and of a powerful kingdom, often referred to as Nestor's kingdom of ""sandy Pylos"" (ἠμαθόεις) and described later by Homer in both his Iliad and his Odyssey (Book 17) when Telemachus says:

The Mycenaean state of Pylos (1600–1200 BC) covered an area of  and had a minimum population of 50,000 according to the Linear B tablets discovered there, or even perhaps as large as 80,000–120,000. It should not however be confused with the current city of Pylos. The urban center of ancient Pylos indeed remains only partially identified to date. The various archaeological remains of palaces and administrative or residential infrastructures that have been found in the region so far suggest to modern scholars that the ancient city would have developed over a much larger area, that of the Pylia Province. The typical point of reference for the Mycenaean city remains the Palace of Nestor, but many other palaces (such as those of Nichoria and Iklaina) or villages (such as Malthi) of the Mycenaean era have been recently discovered, which were quickly subordinated to Pylos. Its port and its acropolis were probably established on the Koryphasion promontory (or Cape Coryphasium) commanding the northern entrance to the bay, 4 km north of the modern city and south of Nestor's palace, but no remains were found.The Pylos site is located on the hill of Ano Englianos, about 9 km northeast of the bay , near the village of Chora and about 17 kilometres from the modern city of Pylos. It hosts one of the most important Mycenaean palaces in Greece, known as the great ""Palace of Nestor"" described in the Homeric poems. This palace remains today the best preserved palace in Greece and one of the most important of all Mycenaean civilization. It was discovered and first excavated in 1939 by American archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887–1971) of the University of Cincinnati and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and by Konstantinos Kourouniotis (1872–1945) of the Greek archaeological service. Their excavations were interrupted by the Second World War, and then resumed in 1952 under the direction of Blegen until 1966. He found many architectural elements such as the throne room with its foyer, an anteroom, rooms and passageways all covered with frescoes of Minoan inspiration, and also large warehouses, the external walls of the palace, unique baths, galleries, and 90 meters outside the palace, a beehive ""tholos"" tomb, perfectly restored in 1957 (Tholos tomb IV).

In addition to the archaeological remains of the palace, Blegen also found there thousands of clay tablets with inscriptions written in Linear B, a syllabic script used between 1425 and 1200 BC for writing Mycenaean Greek. Pylos is the largest source in Greece of these tablets with 1,087 fragments found on the site of the Nestor's Palace. In 1952, when self-taught linguist Michael Ventris and John Chadwick deciphered the script, Mycenaean Greek turned out to be the earliest attested form of Greek, some elements of which have survived in the language of Homer thanks to a long oral tradition of epic poetry. Thus, these clay tablets, generally used for administrative purposes or for recording economic transactions, clearly demonstrate that the site itself was already called ""Pylos"" by its Mycenaean inhabitants (Pulos in Mycenaean Greek; attested in Linear B as  pu-ro, ). 

In 2015, the team of American archaeologists Sharon Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati and under the aegis of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, discovered near the Tholos tomb IV, a shaft tomb (non-tholos) dated to the Late Helladic IIA (LHIIA, 1600–1470 BC), of an individual of 30–35 years old and 1.70 m tall, the ""Griffin warrior"", named for the mythological creature, part eagle, part lion, engraved on an ivory plaque in his tomb. The tomb also contained armor, weapons, mirror and many pearl and gold jewels, including several gold signet rings of exceptional craftsmanship and thoroughness. Researchers believe it could be the grave of a Wanax, a tribal king, lord or military leader during the Mycenaean era. It was also in this tomb that was found the Pylos Combat Agate, a seal made of agate dated from around 1450 BCE, which represents a warrior engaged in a hand-to-hand combat. In 2017, the same team discovered two other exceptional tholos tombs, Tholos tombs VI and VII. Although their domes had collapsed, they discovered that they were littered with flakes of gold leaf that once papered the walls and found a multitude of cultural artifacts and delicate jewelry, including a gold pendant representing the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, which showed for the first time that Pylos clearly had trade relations with Egypt and the Middle East around 1500 BCE.

Pylos was the only palace of that time to have no walls or fortifications. It was destroyed by fire around 1180 BC and many clay tablets in linear B clearly bear the stigmata of the fire. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force. The site of the Mycenaean Pylos then seems to have been abandoned during the Dark Ages (1100–800 BC). The region of Pylos, together with that of the ancient Messene, was later enslaved by Sparta.

The ruins of a crude stone fortress on nearby Sphacteria, apparently of Mycenaean origin, were used by the Spartans during the Peloponnesian War. (Thucydides iv. 31)

Classical Pylos

It was one of the last places which held out against the Spartans in the Second Messenian War, after which the inhabitants emigrated to Cyllene, and from there, with the other Messenians, to Sicily. Its name is mentioned again in the seventh year of the Peloponnesian War. According to the Greek historian Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War, the area was ""together with most of the country round, unpopulated"". The ancient city was not located at the modern Pylos, but north of the isle of Sphacteria. In 425 BC the Athenian politician Cleon sent an expedition to Pylos where the Athenians fortified the rocky promontory now known as Koryphasion (Κορυφάσιον) or Old Pylos at the northern edge of the bay, near the Gialova Lagoon, and after a conflict with Spartan ships in the Battle of Pylos, seized and occupied the bay. Demosthenes, the Athenian commander, completed the fort in 424 BC.

The erection of this fort led to one of the most memorable events in the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides has given a minute account of the topography of the district, which, though clear and consistent with itself, does not coincide, in all points, with the existing locality, Thucydides describes the harbour, of which the promontory Coryphasium (Koryphasion) formed the northern termination, as fronted and protected by the island Sphacteria, which stretched along the coast, leaving only two narrow entrances to the harbour,--the one at the northern end, opposite to Coryphasium, being only wide enough to admit two triremes abreast, and the other at the southern end wide enough for eight or nine triremes. The island was about 15 stadia in width, covered with wood, uninhabited and untrodden.  Pausanias also says that the island Sphacteria lies before the harbour of Pylos like Rheneia before the anchorage of Delos. A little later the Athenians captured a number of Spartan troops besieged on the adjacent island of Sphacteria (see Battle of Sphacteria). Spartan anxiety over the return of the prisoners, who were taken to Athens as hostages, contributed to their acceptance of the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC.

Middle Ages

Little is known of Pylos under Byzantine rule, except for a mention of raids by Cretan Saracens in the area c. 872/3. In the 12th century, the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi mentioned it as the ""commodious port"" of Irūda in his Nuzhat al-Mushtaq.

In 1204, following the Fourth Crusade, the Peloponnese became the Principality of Achaea, a Crusader state. Pylos fell quickly to the Crusaders according to a brief reference in the Chronicle of the Morea, but it is not until the 1280s that it is mentioned again. According to the French and Greek versions of the Chronicle, Nicholas II of Saint Omer, the lord of Thebes, who in c. 1281 received extensive lands in Messenia in exchange for his wife's possessions of Kalamata and Chlemoutsi, erected a castle at Navarino. According to the Greek version, he intended this as a future fief for his nephew, Nicholas III, although the Aragonese version attributes the construction to Nicholas III himself, a few years later. According to A. Bon, a construction under Nicholas II in the 1280s is more likely, possibly in the period 1287–89 when he served as the viceroy (bailli) of Achaea. Despite Nicholas II's intentions, however, it is unclear whether his nephew did indeed inherit Navarino. If he did, it remained his until his death in 1317, when it and all the Messenian lands of the family reverted to the princely domain, as Nicholas III had no children.

The fortress remained relatively unimportant thereafter, except for the naval battle in 1354 between Venice and Genoa, and an episode in 1364, during the conflict between Mary of Bourbon and the Prince Philip of Taranto, due to Mary's attempt to claim the Principality following the death of her husband, Robert of Taranto. Mary had been given possession of Navarino (along with Kalamata and Mani) by Robert in 1358, and the local castellan, loyal to Mary, briefly imprisoned the new Prince's bailli, Simon del Poggio. Mary retained control of Navarino until her death in 1377. At about this time, Albanians settled in the area, while in 1381/2, Navarrese, Gascon and Italian mercenaries were active there. From the early years of the 15th century, Venice set its eyes on the fortress of Navarino, fearing lest its rivals the Genoese seize it and use it as a base for attacks against the Venetian outposts of Modon and Coron. In the event, the Venetians seized the fortress themselves in 1417 and, after prolonged diplomatic manoeuvring, succeeded in legitimizing their new possession in 1423.

First Venetian and first Ottoman periods 

In 1423, Navarino, like the rest of the Peloponnese, suffered its first Ottoman raid, led by Turakhan Bey, which was repeated in 1452. It was also at Navarino that Emperor John VIII Palaiologos embarked in 1437, heading for the Council of Ferrara, and where the last Despot of the Morea, Thomas Palaiologos, embarked with his family in 1460, following the Ottoman conquest of the Despotate of the Morea. After 1460, the fortress, along with the other Venetian outposts and Monemvasia and the Mani Peninsula, were the only Christian-held areas in the peninsula. Venetian control over Navarino survived the First Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–79), but not the Second (1499–1503): following the Venetian defeat in the Battle of Modon in August 1500, the 3,000-strong garrison surrendered, although it was well provisioned for a siege. The Venetians recaptured it shortly after, on 3/4 December, but on 20 May 1501, a joint Ottoman land and sea attack under Kemal Reis and Hadım Ali Pasha retook it.The Ottomans used Navarino (which they called Anavarin or Avarna) as a naval base, either for piratical raids or for major fleet operations in the Ionian and Adriatic seas. In 1572/3, the Ottoman chief admiral (Kapudan Pasha) Uluç Ali Reis built a new fortress at Navarino (Anavarin-i Cedid, ""New Navarino"", or Neokastro in Greek), to replace the outdated Frankish castle.

The Venetians briefly captured Navarino in the 1650s during the Cretan War.

In 1668, Evliya Çelebi described the city in his Seyahatname:
Anavarin-i Atik is an unequalled castle... the harbor is a safe anchorage...in most streets of Anavarin-i Cedid there are many fountains of running water... The city is embellished with trees and vines so that the sun does not beat into the fine marketplace at all, and
all the city notables sit here, playing backgammon, chess, various kinds of draughts, and other board games....

Second Venetian period and Ottoman reconquest
In 1685, during the early stages of the Morean War, the Venetians under Francesco Morosini and Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck invaded the Peloponnese and captured most of it, successfully storming the two fortresses of Navarino in the process. With the peninsula safely in Venetian hands, Navarino became an administrative centre in the new ""Kingdom of the Morea"", as the Venetian province was called, until 1715, when the Ottomans recovered the Peloponnese. The Venetian census of 1689 gave the population as 1,413, while twenty years later it had risen to 1,797 inhabitants.

After the Ottoman reconquest, Navarino became the centre of a kaza in the Sanjak of the Morea. On 10 April 1770, after a six-day siege, the fortress of New Navarino surrendered to the Russians during the Orlov Revolt. The Ottoman garrison was allowed to depart for Crete, while the Russians repaired the fortress to make it their base. On 1 June, however, the Russians left, and the Ottomans re-entered the fort and burned and partially demolished it. Meanwhile, the population gathered there had escaped to nearby Sphacteria, where Albanian mercenaries of the Ottomans slaughtered most of them.

The Greek War of Independence of 1821 

After the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman occupation in mid-March 1821, the Greeks quickly won many victories and proclaimed their independence on 1 January 1822. Navarino was besieged by the local Greeks on 29 March. The garrison, augmented by the local Muslim population of Kyparissia, held out until the first week of August, when they were forced to capitulate. Despite their promise for safe conduct, the Greeks massacred them all.

The Greek victories was short lived. The Sultan called for aid from his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, and later added 25,000 troops. Ibrahim's intervention proved decisive: the region of Pylos fell on 18 May 1825 after the battles of Sphacteria (8 May) and Neokastro (11 May), much of the Peloponnese was reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi fell in 1826; and Athens was taken in 1827. The only territory still held by Greek nationalists was in Nafplion, Mani, Hydra, Spetses and Aegina.

The Naval Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) 
A strong current of philhellenism had developed in Western Europe, especially after the fall in 1826 of Missolonghi, where the poet Lord Byron had died in 1824. Many artists and intellectuals like Chateaubriand, Victor Hugo, Alexander Pushkin, Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz or Eugène Delacroix (in his paintings Scenes massacres of Scio in 1824, and Greece on the ruins of Missolonghi in 1826), amplified the current of sympathy for the Greek cause in the public opinion. By the Treaty of London of July 1827, France, Russia and the United Kingdom recognised the autonomy of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a fleet of 27 warships of the allied navies of United Kingdom, France and Russia was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. It included twelve British ships (for 456 guns), seven French ships (352 guns) and eight Russian ships (490 guns), for a total firepower of nearly 1,300 guns. The Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) resulted in the total destruction of the combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleet (around 60 warships destroyed).

An obelisk-shaped memorial dedicated to the victory of the Allied fleets and their three admirals, the British Edward Codrington, the French Henri de Rigny and the Russian Lodewijk van Heiden was later erected on the central square of Pylos. The monument was the work of the sculptor Thomas Thomopoulos (1873–1937) and its unveiling took place in 1930, although it was completed in 1933.

The liberation of Pylos (6 October 1828) and the construction of the modern city 

On 6 October 1828, Pylos was definitively liberated from the Ottoman–Egyptian troops of Ibrahim Pasha by the French troops of the Morea expedition commanded by Marshal Nicolas-Joseph Maison. The mission of this expeditionary corps of 15,000 men, sent by king Charles X of France to the Peloponnese between 1828 and 1833, was to implement the Treaty London of 1827, an agreement under which the Greeks would have the right to an independent state. The French troops liberated the cities of Navarino (Pylos), Modon (Methoni), Coron (Koroni) and Patras in October 1828.

The current city of Pylos was built starting in the spring of 1829, outside the walls of Neokastro, on the model of the bastides of Southwest France and the cities of the Ionian Islands (which share common features, such as a central geometrical square bordered by covered galleries built with a succession of contiguous arches, each supported by a colonnade, as the arcades of Pylos or Corfu). Pylos's urban framework was designed by Joseph-Victor Audoy, lieutenant-colonel of the military engineering of the Morea expedition, who originated from Tarn, a department of Southwest France. This plan was approved by the governor of independent Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias on 15 January 1831, making it the second urban plan (after that of Methoni) in the history of the modern Greek state. The fortifications of Neokastro were raised, a barracks was built (the ""Maison's building"" which houses nowadays the Archaeological Museum of Pylos), many improvements were made to the city (installation of school, hospital, church, postal service, shops, bridges, squares, fountains, gardens, etc.), the old Ottoman aqueduct, which had fallen into ruins until 1828, was restored (it then served until 1907), and the road between Navarin and Modon, the first road of independent Greece (which is still used today), was also built by the French engineers.

Part of the Morea expedition were also 19 scientists from the ""Morea Scientific Mission"", whose work proved essential to the ongoing development of the new Greek State and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece. According to one of their population censuses in the province of Navarino in 1829, it had a total of 1,596 inhabitants. Some French merchants and officers of the Morea expedition, who remained in the city with their families after the troops returned to France in 1833, settled in a district located in the north of the city, near a Catholic church that has since been demolished. This district is still called today ""Francomahalas"" (in Greek: Φραγκομαχαλάς, from Arabic: محلة (mahallah), district) or ""Francoklisa"" (in Greek: Φραγκοκλησά, church of the French). The French always had a particular interest in the city, and at that time, the greatest French writers wrote texts specifically dedicated to Pylos, such as François-René de Chateaubriand in 1806, Eugène Sue and Victor Hugo in 1827, Edgar Quinet in 1830 and Alphonse de Lamartine in 1832.

In 1833, after the departure of the French, the name ""Pylos"" (in reference to the ancient city of King Nestor) was given to the new city of Navarino by royal decree of the newly installed king Otto I of Greece.

20th century 
The fortress of Pylos was transformed into a place of deportation of political opponents during the totalitarian regime of Metaxas between 1936 and 1941. Administratively, Pylos was the seat of the Municipality of Pylos between 1912 and 1946, then became the seat of the Deme of Pylos between 1946 and 2010. Since the 2011 reform, Pylos has been the seat of the new Municipality of Pylos-Nestor.

Geography

Site 
The city of Pylos is located at the foot of a promontory which extends Mount Aghios Nikolaos (482 m) and carries the fortress. It is located at the south-western end of Peloponnese, on the Ionian coast. It is an important shipping center and, in recent years, it has experienced significant tourist development, exploiting its magnificent coastline. The narrow island of Sphacteria serves as a natural breakwater for Navarino Bay, making the port of Pylos one of the safest anchors of the Ionian coast.

Communication 
Pylos has excellent roads and all the communication amenities of a modern city. Greek National Road 82 departs from the center of Pylos and connects directly to Kalamata in less than an hour, and from there to Athens in two hours. Kalamata International Airport (KLX, Captain Vassilis C. Constantakopoulos Airport), which is expanding rapidly, offers many scheduled flights to the major cities of Greece, and many charter flights during the touristic season from many international destinations.

Population
According to the census of 2011, the municipality (deme) of Pylos-Nestor has 21,077 inhabitants. The municipal unit of Pylos has 5,287 inhabitants, while Pylos intramural has 2,345 inhabitants, making it the seventh most populous city in Messenia, after the capital Kalamata (54,100), Messini (6,065), Filiatra (5,969), Kyparissia (5,131), Gargalianoi (5,007) and Chora (3,454).

Urban landscape

Navarino castles 

The city of Pylos has two castles (Kastra): the Frankish Paleokastro (old castle) and the Ottoman Neokastro (new castle). The first is located northwest of Navarino Bay and north of the island of Sphacteria, while the second is southwest of the bay, on the heights of the city of Pylos. The Paleokastro, located on the top of the promontory of Coryphasium (Koryphasion) (which is in geological continuity with the island of Sphacteria from which it is only separated by the narrow pass of Sykia), is built on the site of the ancient acropolis of Pylos. It offers a panoramic view, stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Plain of Pylia. Below is Nestor's cave, where, according to mythology, the king of Pylos raised his oxen, and the bay of Voidokilia, whose beach is regularly ranked among the most beautiful in the world. It borders the Gialova lagoon (Osman-aga lake), located to the east and Navarino bay to the south. However, access to the Paleokastro may present some risks for the safety of visitors, due to its great deterioration. On the other side of the Navarino bay, the Neokastro, which is in a better state of conservation, looks out onto the island of Sphacteria, the bay of Navarino, and the city. It is one of the best preserved castles in Greece. It contains within its walls the well-preserved Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior, built by the Franks, later transformed into a mosque, then again into a Christian church. In the pine forest of the Neokastro is also the old barracks built by the French troops of the Morea expedition, which now houses the new archaeological museum of Pylos.

Navarino aqueduct 

South of the city of Pylos, on the road to Methoni, is the old Navarino aqueduct, built in the 16th century by the Ottomans to meet the water supply needs of the Neokastro. Composed by two hydraulic systems, it led the waters from the water intakes of the plateau of Koumbeh (located near the town of Chandrinou about 15 kilometers northeast of Pylos on the road to Kalamata) and Paleo Nero (located near the village of Palaionero). The two systems combined into a single system that can still be seen today around Pylos in the district of Kamares. Then, thanks to an underground conduit of the aqueduct, the water penetrated inside the fortress to feed there the fountains of the Neokastro. Fallen into ruins until 1828, it was restored in 1832 by the French engineers of the Morea expedition, and was used to supply Pylos with water until 1907.

Pylos city center 

Leaning against two hills, one of which is overlooked by the fortress of the Neokastro, the town of Pylos faces the bay of Navarino. Pylos preserves many houses from the 19th century. These are built of stone, with typical Messenian architecture and surrounded by spacious courtyards and gardens. They are built mainly between narrow streets, generally symmetrical, and according to the original urban plan established by French military engineers of the Morea expedition at the beginning of the 19th century. Many of the streets have retained their original stone paving, and several of those which climb the hills, are pedestrianized and have steps.

Near the seafront is the central city square, the Square of the Three Admirals, surrounded by buildings whose ground floor houses, most often under arcade galleries, markets, bakeries, shops and traditional cafes. The seaside, to the north-west of the city, follows a recently pedestrianized street which leads from the central square to the modern port, passing through the Francomahalas district. In this street, aligned along the old port, are several traditional fish taverns. The port is dominated by the City Hall of Pylos. Next to it is recently renovated two-story house of the Olympic champion Kostis Tsiklitiras, in which a museum has been installed, which exposes a collection of paintings, engravings and ancient documents collected by the French philhellene, historian and writer René Puaux (1878–1936). A little further, still following the seaside, is the historic building of the College of Pylos which was founded in September 1921 by royal decree and built in 1924. After the cessation of its activities in 1987, the building housed until very recently the Institute of Physical Astrophysics ""Nestor"" of the National Observatory of Greece. The institute is in charge of the international research project NESTOR and its underwater neutrino detector, which is installed more than 4,000 meters deep, in the deepest marine trench of the Mediterranean Sea, 31 km off Pylos. In September 1992, the historic building of the College of Pylos was classified by the Ministry of Culture as a Preserved Historic Monument and will house soon in the near future the public library and gallery of the municipality of Pylos.

The city also has bank branches, a post office, various clinics, a health center, a fire station, a sailing school, nurseries, primary schools, a college, a high school and a music conservatory recognized by the State. The city is also home to several cultural and development associations.

The central square of the Three Admirals 
Also built by French troops of the Morea expedition in 1829, the central square of Pylos is characterized by its triangular geometric pattern, one of the sides of which opens onto the sea and the port of Pylos, and whose two other sides are bordered by covered galleries with arcades, built with a succession of contiguous arches, each supported by a colonnade, recalling the architecture of the central squares of the bastides of Southwest France and those of the cities of the Ionian Islands (such as Corfu). These galleries are home to many small markets and businesses, as well as traditional and more modern cafes and restaurants. Most of their terraces extend over the square itself, which is shaded by several hundred-year-old plane trees. In the center, surrounded by two majestic phoenix, is a monument commemorating the battle of Navarino, an obelisk dedicated to the victory of the Allied fleets and their three admirals, the British Edward Codrington, the French Henri de Rigny and the Russian Lodewijk van Heiden.

Churches 
On the eastern slope of Pylos hill is the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Ieros Naos tis Kimiseos tis Theotokou), while to the west, inside the Neokastro, is the former Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior (Ieros Naos tis Metamorphosis tou Sotiros), both of which belong to the Diocese of Messenia. The Church of the Transfiguration organizes sometimes religious activities (it has been converted into a museum and an exhibition center), while that of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary still gathers many faithful during its regular offices, and particularly during the celebrations of Easter and of the Myrtiodiotissa Virgin (the Virgin with myrtles, to whom the church is dedicated) which attract many tourists from Athens and abroad to attend the processions organized in the center of the city.

The port and the marina 

The port of Pylos is one of the safest boarding destinations for ships traveling in the Mediterranean Sea. Navarino Bay continues to regularly serve as a shelter for ships during storms in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, its strategic location between the Ionian Sea and the Aegean Sea makes it an ideal destination for an intermediate station on the route to the Cyclades, the Dodecanese Islands or to Crete. With its modern pier, it frequently welcomes many cruise ships during the summer season. To the east of the port, there is also the marina of Pylos, for which a project of modernization is currently running to meet the requirements for the rapid tourism development of the region.

Around Pylos

The Palace of Nestor 

North of Pylos () and south of the town of Chora (4 kilometres), is the hill of Ano Englianos which houses the Mycenaean Bronze Age palace known as the ""Palace of Nestor"" (1600–1200 BC). This palace remains today in Greece the best preserved palace and one of the most important of all Mycenaean civilization. The remains of the palace consist of the throne room with its foyer, an anteroom, passageways, large warehouses, the external walls of the palace, unique baths, galleries, and 90 meters away from the palace, a beehive tholos tomb (funerary chamber with dome) perfectly restored in 1957 (Tholos tomb IV). Very recently, in 2015, the team of American archaeologists Sharon Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati discovered and excavated, near the palace, the tomb of the ""Griffin Warrior"", and even more recently in 2017, two other tholos tombs (Tholos tombs VI and VII), all three containing a multitude of cultural artifacts and jewels of exceptional delicacy (such as the Pylos Combat Agate or a golden pendant depicting the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, which show that Pylos had trading connections, previously unknown, with Egypt and the Near East around 1500 B.C.E). In June 2016, the site reopened to the public after 3 years of work to replace the old roof of the 1960s with a modern structure with elevated walkways for visitors. The archaeological site of the Palace of Nestor can be visited every day, except on holidays and on Tuesdays.

The Archaeological Museum of Chora 

The archaeological museum is located in the center of the village of Chora, located 4 kilometres north of the Palace of Nestor. The museum was built in 1969 to house the artifacts discovered in Nestor's Palace and in the rest of the region. However, some of them are currently exposed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, in the first room devoted to Mycenaean civilization. The Museum of Chora has three rooms. The first room contains finds almost exclusively from the tombs of the region: pots, weapons and jewelry. The second room contains finds from the region of Englianos and from the Palace of Nestor. In addition to the large storage jars and other ceramics from the palace warehouses, there are some wall frescoes, such as that depicting a lyre player with a bird, as well as war and hunting scenes. In the last room are exposed other finds from the hill of Englianos and the Palace of Nestor and in particular part of the contents of the tombs of this region, such as giant vases, cups and jewelry. The Archaeological Museum of Chora can be visited every day, except on public holidays and on Tuesdays.

The lagoon of Gialova and the beaches of Voïdokilia and Divari 

North of Navarino Bay, near the village of Gialova, the Gialova wetland (Osman-aga lake) is one of 10 major lagoons in Greece. Part of the Natura 2000 network, it is considered a place of remarkable natural beauty and as one of the important bird areas in Europe. It has also been listed as a 1500-acre archaeological site, lying between Gialova and the bay of Voidokilia. Its alternative name of Vivari is Latin, meaning 'fishponds'. With a depth, at its deepest point, of no more than four meters, its pond constitutes an ornithological reserve of exceptional importance in Europe, as it is the southernmost stopover of birds migrating between the Balkans and Africa. It gives shelter to no fewer than 270 bird species, among them greater flamingos, glossy ibis, grey herons, great egrets, little egrets, Eurasian curlews, golden plovers, black-winged stilts, great cormorants, common kingfishers, ruffs, garganeys, but also Audouin's gulls and birds of prey (lesser kestrels, ospreys, peregrine falcons and imperial eagles). It is Gialova, too, which plays host to a very rare species, nearing extinction throughout Europe, the African chameleon. The observation post of the Greek Ornithological Society allows visitors to find out more and to watch the shallow brackish waters of the lake; they can walk the paths that circumscribe Gialova's different ecosystems.At the western end of the lagoon is the small bay of Voidokilia, whose cove-shaped beach is regularly ranked among the most beautiful in the world. It is bordered on one side (to the east) by the Divari lagoon from which it is separated by a dune bank, on the other side (to the west) by the Ionian Sea onto which it opens, and finally on a third side (to the south) by the Navarino bay. The beach is also part of the Natura 2000 network. It is free to access and can be reached by two routes: either by a road from the village of Gialova which crosses the Divari lagoon, or by a path which crosses the village of Petrochori. On the northern promontory at the entrance to the Voidokilia lagoon is a Mycenaean beehive tholos tomb known as ""Thrasymedes', the son of king Nestor. On the heights of the beach, going up towards the Paleokastro, is the cave known as ""Cave of Nestor"", in which, according to mythology, the king of Pylos was raising his oxen.

On the way from Voïdokilia to the village of Gialova to the east, an asphalt road follows the narrow strip of land passing between the Divari lagoon and Navarino bay. Along this road is a long white sandy beach which runs along the bay of Navarino: the Beach of the Golden Coast (Paralia tis Chrysis Aktis) or Divari beach. It joins to the east another beach, within the village of Gialova, the beach of Gialova.

Events 

Since 2017, every year around October 20, the “Navarinia” are organized in memory of the battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) by the municipality of Pylos-Nestor and the volunteers of the local association who is in charge to organize the event. Spread over a period of several days, the celebrations culminate on the anniversary of the battle in the port of Pylos, with the participation of the Hellenic Navy and diplomatic and military representatives of the three Allied countries. Frigates of the Hellenic, British, French and Russian navies, as well as many old sailing ships take part in the reenactment of the famous battle organized with an impressive sound and light show. The evening most often ends with the firing of a reconstructed ship that supposedly took part in the battle and with an impressive fireworks display fired from the port.

The celebrations are also accompanied on previous days by various cultural events that take place in parallel in other parts of the city (ceremonies and tributes to the dead on the various memorials of Pylos and of the region, national and international conferences, parades in the streets of Pylos, traditional musical and dance performances, etc.). Although organized at the end of the touristic season, these celebrations generally attract a large crowd of spectators. In 2019, the demonstrations, which took place in the presence of the President of the Hellenic Republic, gathered more than 10,000 visitors. In 2020, the Navarinia have been awarded the Gold Tourism Award 2020 in the category Cultural Tourism.

951,22900287,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECAMI,ECAMI,"ECAMI (Empresa de Comunicaciones, S.A.) is a renewable energy business based in Nicaragua, selling solar PV, wind power and hydroelectric systems. ECAMI was founded in 1982 by Luis Lacayo Lacayo, to supply radio communications equipment in rural areas of Nicaragua where infrastructure had been destroyed during the prolonged civil conflict and revolution. Photovoltaics (PV) were the ideal way of powering this
equipment, because there was no grid electricity. Many other opportunities for PV became  apparent to Lacayo, like home lighting, battery-charging, water pumping and refrigeration. Over the years the provision of renewable energy systems became more important than communications and is now the main activity of ECAMI.

ECAMI routinely supplies and installs solar-homes PV systems in rural areas. ECAMI designs and installs PV-powered mini grids to provide power for homes, hotels, museums and planned health centers in small communities.  Underground distribution systems connect all the users to the supply, with individual current limits to each facility. ECAMI installs PV supply systems for mobile phone masts, with considerable savings in fuel diesel.

In Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, six hotels have been supplied with solar water heating systems by ECAMI. One with 50 m2 of panel area supplies 100 rooms each of which had previously required a 6 kW immersion heater, another with 16 m2 of panels supplies 40 rooms. About 150 domestic solar water-heaters have also been installed.

ECAMI supplies and installs small wind turbines of between 400 W and 5 kW output, and can also install hydro-electric system.

The benefits of the thousands of renewable energy systems installed by ECAMI are considerable: more than 100,000 people have been benefited in Nicaragua while the use of CO2 emitting fuels and air pollution is being reduced. The social and economic benefits are perceived through longer hours of emergency service in health centers, the installations of water pumps that bring drinking water to distant communities, the access of satellite internet, land irrigation, longer and more efficient working hours, etc.

Luis Lacayo's wife Claudia, a lawyer, joined ECAMI in 1997 to manage the administration and contracts, and their son Max Lacayo, also a lawyer, is now the marketing director.

On June 11, 2009, in London, Charles, Prince of Wales presented Max Lacayo The Ashden Energy Enterprise Award for ECAMI's achievements, particularly for the installation of high quality photovoltaic systems in rural and off-grid areas.  The Ashden Awards are an internationally recognised yardstick for excellence in the field of sustainable energy.

ECAMI is a GVEP (Global Village Energy Partnership] partner. Other memberships include: International Solar Energy Society (ISES), ANPPER Nicaraguan Association of Renewable Energy Promoters and Products, and ANPPER Nicaraguan Association of Renewable Energy Promoters and Products. ECAMI has work agreements with similar foreign companies: Curin Corporation (USA), Isratec (Guatemala), Energy & Systems (Canada), etc.

954,39801566,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaris%20LAR01,Flaris LAR01,"Flaris LAR01, also variously called the LAR 1 and LAR-1, is a Polish five-seat very light jet, currently under development by Metal-Master of Jelenia Góra. It is the only single-engined very light jet currently being developed by a non-American aircraft manufacturer.

The programme was publicly unveiled at the 2013 Paris Air Show, and has been promoted to private owner-operators and corporate customers, as well as commercial operators. Originally intended to perform its maiden flight as early as 2013, the prototype first flew on 5 April 2019.

Development

Origins
The Flaris LAR01 project was started by Sylwia and Rafał Ładzińscy with the assistance of the Instytut Lotnictwa, Instytut Techniczny Wojsk Lotniczych, Politechnika Warszawska, Politechnika Wrocławska and Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna. According to Ładziński, the aircraft had emerged from an ambition to produce an affordable aircraft that would be well-suited to short-haul point-to-point routes and operated by a variety of commercial, corporate, and private owners that sought to progress from operating piston engine and turboprop-powered aircraft. Rafał Ładziński, who had co-originated the aircraft's design with Sylwia Ładziński, serves as the head of the FLARIS project and the chief of Research and Development. The chief designer is Andrzej Frydrychewicz. Significant work on the aircraft's aerodynamics was performed by Krzysztof Kubryński.

In June 2013, the existence of the LAR01 programme was publicly unveiled at the 2013 Paris Air Show. Among the attributes of the aircraft emphasised during its initial announcement were its unique and previously-unserved role in the general aviation market, ease of flight, lightweight construction, low operational cost, safety, and versatility. The company has forecast a demand for the type of hundreds of aircraft per year.

During the 2013 event, at which a prototype of the aircraft was displayed, it was announced that the LAR01 would be the first of three aircraft that manufacturer planned to launch; while few details were stated, it was said that of the two future aircraft, one would be smaller than the LAR01 while the other would be larger. In June 2015, at which point the subject of future family members was discussed in greater detail by the manufacturer, it was revealed that there were future ambitions for a series of business jets to be produced, and that the next design following on from the LAR01 was to adopt a twin-engine configuration.

Prototypes
During the 2013 reveal at the Paris airshow, it was stated that an initial prototype of the aircraft would fly later that same year, as well as speculation on the delivery of a batch of 20 aircraft during 2014. During March 2014, the non-flying first prototype was being used for non-destructive load testing, while the second prototype was announced as being intended to perform the type's maiden flight later that year; however, it was acknowledged at the time that there was a lack of certainty over exact dates. The order book is intended to be opened shortly after the maiden flight taking place. By May 2014, the company was already in the process of establishing an assembly line for the type, as well as beginning the construction of the third and fourth prototypes.

The second prototype was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PW610, although alternative powerplants were already under consideration to power subsequent production aircraft. Aerospace publication Aviation Week has attributed uncertainty over the engine as a reason for delays in the programme. Once in flight, the second prototype would participate in the certification programme, along with a further two prototypes; in December 2014, the manufacturer envisioned the construction of a total of five prototypes. Final CS-23 certification for the LAR01 from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was anticipated to occur roughly three years following the first flight. In February 2015, the second prototype commenced a series of taxi tests while it reportedly approached the end of ground-based testing.

In March 2015, it was stated that the type was expected to receive type certification during 2018. During 2015, it was stated that initial deliveries, then forecast to take place in 2016, would be validated under the Polish civil aviation authority's S-1 experimental aircraft designation, prior to full EASA certification being issued. In February 2016, it was stated that the first flight of the LAR01 was set to take place within the following months. In July 2016, engine ground tests of a LAR-1 equipped with the Williams FJ33-5A, which is to be used in production aircraft, commenced. In February 2017, it was reported that the LAR01 has entered the final stage of ground testing and would perform its first flight within the first half of the year. According to the company, it has been working closely with the Polish civil aviation authority on tests of the onboard systems, including the final tests of the aircraft's detachable wing and cabin pressurisation system.

In June 2018, ground testing was completed before a maiden flight that was anticipated at that time for July 2018. The first 50–100 hours of flight testing was forecast to be carried out at the Zielona Góra Airport in western Poland before a transfer to Copernicus Airport Wrocław.
At that time the company anticipated that the Polish Civil Aviation Authority S-1 experimental certification would be granted after 150 hours of flight testing, all completed within 12 months, before 10 local deliveries, and before full EASA CS-23 type certification, which would follow within 18 and 24 months.
Customer orders were expected to be accepted starting in 2019. The aircraft is intended to be exhibited in May 2019 at EBACE in Geneva and in July 2019 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh.

In September 2018 the first flight had still not occurred and the company website stated, ""The maiden flight depends on many factors, such as the weather, and it is difficult to set the exact date. We plan to hold a public demonstration flight only after completing the first test flights.""

The prototype, registered SP-YLE, first flew on 5 April 2019 from Zielona Gora Babimost Airport.
By February 2020, the initial prototype had logged 60 hours ands the production-conforming test aircraft was prepared for a maiden flight in early April. The company had received 50 orders, mostly from owner-flyers.
Polish S-1 experimental certification was expected in the fourth quarter, after 200 hours of flight testing, with delivery of the first aircraft forecast for 2021, before applying for EASA CS-23 certification sometime after that.
The flight testing program was planned to include system tests on the Williams FJ33 engine, the retractable landing gear, hydraulics, the Garmin G600TXi flightdeck, autopilot and autothrottle.
The prototype reached 25,000 ft in under three minutes and 30 seconds, and demonstrated a stall speed of 58 knots (107 km/h).

Design
The Flaris LAR01 is a Polish five-seat very light jet, intended for general aviation use. It is made largely of carbon fiber reinforced polymers and powered by a single turbojet engine – the production version of the LAR01 is to be powered by a single Williams FJ33-5A engine. The LAR01 is intended to be affordable and accessible to individual private owners. Proposed uses for it include air taxi operations, personal transport, emergency medical services and aerial surveillance, as well as its potential modification into an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

The LAR01 has been optimised for use by private pilots. Where possible, the cockpit is deliberately designed to mimic that of a traditional car. The designers intend to provide removable elliptical wings for the aircraft; this measure is to enable the type to be readily parked within typical garages; sections of the tailplane can be similarly detached for the same purpose. Fuel is housed within a tank mounted on the fuselage, deliberately avoiding the use of the wings for fuel storage. The LAR01 is also reported as being relatively easy to control.

Various features for safety and convenience are to be incorporated into the LAR01's design. Unlike many jet-powered aircraft, it is claimed to be readily capable of being operable from unpaved runways and grass strips. For safety purposes, the LAR01 has been designed to use a ballistic rescue parachute system, one parachute being installed within the tail and the other within the nose, which is intended to assist in the safe recovery of the aircraft. It can be equipped with various models of Garmin glass cockpits. An electric de-icing system is also fitted.

The €1.8 million ($2 million) aircraft is forecast to have direct operating costs (fuel, maintenance and insurance) of $450 per hour and have a Garmin G600 TXi flight deck. It should cruise at , have a range of  with a MTOW of 1,500 kg (3,300 lb), and will be able to take off and land on grass airstrips and short runways of less than 250 m (820 ft).

957,46254506,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition%20%28film%29,Coalition (film),"Coalition is a 2015 British television film about the formation of a coalition government following the 2010 United Kingdom general election. It was broadcast on Channel 4 on 28 March 2015, shortly before that year's general election. The film was written by James Graham and starred Bertie Carvel as Nick Clegg, Ian Grieve as Gordon Brown, and Mark Dexter as David Cameron. Graham wrote the film in the aim of giving humanity and enabling empathy to all of the figures portrayed within it, which earned it positive reviews from critics.

Plot

Nick Clegg is popular with the electorate ahead of the 2010 general election, with his Liberal Democrat party promising electoral reform and an end to the dominance of the two main parties, Labour and Conservative, who had led every British government in almost 90 years. The election results in a hung parliament with no party having a majority of seats: the Conservatives have the most, then the governing Labour, and then the Liberal Democrats. Nick is disappointed that his popularity did not reflect in the results, but is consoled by his party's former leader, Paddy Ashdown.

As the party with the most seats, the Conservatives led by David Cameron are given the first choice to form a government, which will either be a minority government or a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Conservative peers are vehemently opposed to working with the Liberal Democrats due to what they see to be contrasting policies, but Shadow Chancellor George Osborne tells David that if they ally with them, it would put the Tories into a centrist position and potentially make them more electable for the next general election. Meanwhile, Labour, led by incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown, prepare for negotiations with the Liberal Democrats. Gordon points out to Nick that both parties are left-wing and progressive, but Nick is held back by the personal unpopularity of Brown amongst the British public.

Liberal Democrat MPs meet with their Conservative counterparts to negotiate a possible government, discussing the possibility of a referendum on electoral reform. Conservative peers are furious with Cameron on this proposal, stating that reform would end any future possibility of a Conservative majority government. However, he convinces them by saying that a Labour—Liberal Democrat coalition would pass electoral reform without a referendum, as both parties support it. In another meeting, Gordon tries to win over Nick by promising to resign during their first term in government, but Nick wants it sooner.

Gordon resigns for the good of his party and to leave in a dignified way, strategically forcing David Cameron into becoming Prime Minister in a minority government. Nick is adamant to form a coalition as he sees Labour as unpopular. His MPs are angry with the possibility of a coalition with the Conservatives, due to the opposition between the two parties. However, Paddy Ashdown makes a speech saying that this is the best opportunity for the party to enter government and execute their policies. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats form a coalition.

Production
The film was written by James Graham, who also scripted This House, a National Theatre play about the government of James Callaghan from 1976 to 1979. Graham chose to dramatise the formation of the government in 2010 because ""The personalities, clashes, the farcical nature of some of it, the loss of dignity – it was characterful and weird. The lack of sleep, the pressure, and exhaustion make it exciting ... It's really important to me to try and humanise them"". He stated that the message of the film was not to change political opinions, but to encourage empathy towards politicians because ""There's this presumption that they're all corrupt and incompetent – but I'd love people to empathise with the incredible situation"".

The film was sponsored by Japanese car manufacturer Lexus.

Reception
Kasia Delgado of Radio Times praised the film for managing ""to make the most powerful men in the country seem both ridiculous, and entirely human"", calling it ""like The Thick of It on valium"".

In the New Statesman, Anoosh Chakelian wrote that it ""starts off as satire and ends as an opera. It is the young playwright's eye for detail and evident reams of source material that allow for such an astute commentary, and human portrayal"", while also being ""masterfully unbiased; the one clear lesson to the audience is that our politicians are humans"". She singled out the best performance to be Gatiss as Mandelson, as the ""darkly frivolous"" performance ""has the macabre silliness spot on"".

Lucy Mangan of The Guardian stated that her opinion of the film was prejudiced by opinions on the politicians portrayed within it, but wrote that  it gave a new image to them when ""bloodless freaks began to swell with life and humanity"".

When commenting on the actors, GQ writer Ian McGurk praised the range of the portrayal of Brown by Grieve but reserved highest praise for Mark Dexter as Cameron, citing Dexter's striking physical similarity to the real Cameron and adding that ""He also gives the best performance"".

958,15216607,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska%20Coastal%20Airlines,Alaska Coastal Airlines,"Alaska Coastal Airlines was an airline in the United States. It was formed in 1939 as a result of the merger of Alaska Air Transport and Marine Airways. On April 1, 1962, Alaska Coastal Airlines merged with Ellis Air Lines, trading for a while as Alaska Coastal-Ellis Airlines. Alaska Coastal Airlines was taken over by Alaska Airlines in April 1968.

History
Alaska Air Transport was formed by Sheldon Bruce ""Shell"" Simmons (October 8, 1908 – November 16, 1994) at Juneau in the summer of 1935 with one Stinson SM-2AC aircraft named Patco. Alaska Air Transport bought out Irving Airways in September 1936. Irving Airways had been started by Wilbur Irving at Juneau in the spring of 1936. 

Marine Airways was formed by Alex Holden, Jim Davis and M E Monagle in Juneau in July 1936. Holden bought a Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker NC196N in August 1936. In 1938, Simmons used Bellanca NC47M in the rescue of survivors of the Patterson, an oceangoing freighter which had run aground at Cape Fairweather, 150 miles northwest of Juneau. In 1939, Simmons and Holden joined forces, forming Alaskan Coastal Airways.

Ellis Air Lines was formed in Ketchikan in 1936 by Robert Edmund ""Bob"" Ellis (January 2, 1903 – May 8, 1994). At the time of the merger his fleet consisted of ten Grumman G-21 Goose amphibian aircraft.

In 1945, Simmons went to Vancouver, BC, and purchased a Grumman G-21 Goose, formerly in the service of the Royal Canadian Air Force On one occasion in the late 1960s, a woman had a baby in flight between Gustavus and Juneau.

Alaska Island Airways was acquired by Alaska Coastal Airlines in 1954.

961,54332639,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle%20of%20Ourique,Castle of Ourique,"The Castle of Ourique (), is a Portuguese medieval castle in civil parish of Ourique, in the municipality of the same name, in the district of Beja.

History
The castle is linked to the legendary battle of 1139, wherein D. Afonso Henriques defeated a superior Moorish army. In reality, there is still some doubt where the event occurred, even as it was fundamental to the history of an independent Kingdom of Portugal, but not to the history of the castle.

Between the 13th and 14th century, the castle was rebuilt by order of King D. Dinis, possibly over an ancient Romanized castro, later occupied by the Moors. The castle then began to pertain to the Order of São Tiago. Within the nucleus of the historic village are a set of 21 medieval silos (from relatively uncertain chronology), dating to the 14th century. From the estate salvaged by Manuel Maia in 1995, the early Medieval and Modern ceramics stand out, identifying a stratified testimony of the settlement until 18th century.

The castle and settlement received its first Foral (charter) on 8 January 1290.

A new foral was issued in 1510 by King D. Manuel I.

In the second half of the 20th century, the remaining sections were ""restored"" and a portion of the wall served as a base for a viewpoint that still crowns the highest point of the village. In 1960, a tank was constructed using a line of walls and a platform to establish a reservoir and garden.

On 16 March 1973, there was a proposal by the Secretaria de Estado da Instrução e Cultura (Secretary-of-State for Instruction and Culture) to classify the site, which was later supported by the Junta Nacional de Educação (National Junta for Education) who suggested classifying it as a Imóvel de Interesse Público (Property of Public Interest). It was supported on 30 May 1973. But, on 3 May 2010, there was a proposal to closed the process by the DRCAlentejo, due to the ""disappearance"" of the property. It was also supported on 23 November 2011 by the SPAA of National Council of Culture, who archived the process the director of IGESPAR. On 14 September 2012, there was a announcement (13417/2012, Diário da República, Série 2, 179) to archive the classification process, owing to the impossibility of discovering any wall that could limit the viewpoint or walls. This resulted in the beginning of archaeological work to confirm the existence of vestiges on site.

Architecture
The remains of the castle are located on an isolated hillock. The remains of the castle are implanted on an area of the hill,  altitude, dominated by a vast plain of the Campo de Ourique, between the ravines of Castanheiros and Cotovio, at a confluence  north of the parish settlement, alongside the parochial church.

The military architecture consisted of a fort/citadel and fortification wall that encircled the settlement of Ourique. Practically demolished in the 1960s, little vestiges remain of the line of walls or support structures. Unfortunately, the remains today are scarce and adulterated: they do not allow for any rigorous study of possible constructive phases.

Of the original structure, there is very little that can be inferred; its Gothic nature and oval plan fortifications included tower and main door, but little remains. The castle had a relatively heterodox characteristics, in comparison to other Gothic prototypes. Today, where there must have been a medieval tower is a quadrangular water reservoir. Along the old fence, covered with recent stone material, is the border of the town lookout, topped by a wall built of concrete and fenestrated by a frieze, typical of public works constructed during the 2nd Republic. The access to this space is through a small pointed arch, probably echoing the previous structure: it was erected as a variation of the medieval theme.

It is  northwest of London,  southeast of Birmingham,  south of Coventry and  north northwest of the county town of Oxford.

General history

Origin of the toponym
The toponym ""Banbury"" derives from ""Banna"", a Saxon chieftain said to have built a stockade there in the 6th century, and ""burgh"" meaning settlement. One Saxon spelling was Banesbyrig. The name appears as Banesberie in the Domesday Book of 1086. Another known Medieval spelling was 'Banesebury'

The derivation of the name of the Grimsbury, now part of Banbury, is of early Saxon type, and is the corruption of word for a defended enclosure (burh) belonging to a personage called 'Grim', thought to be a reference to a masked persona of the god Woden.

Roman and Anglo-Saxon history

Banbury stands at the junction of two ancient roads: Salt Way (used as a bridle path to the west and south of the town), its primary use being the local transportation of salt ; and Banbury Lane, which began near Northampton and is closely followed by the modern road. It continued through what is now Banbury High Street and onwards to the Fosse Way at Stow-on-the-Wold. The earliest settlement at Banbury was in the British Iron Age. The remains of a settlement with circular buildings dating back to 200 BC were found in 2002 during excavations for the foundations of a building in Hennef Way. The site contained around 150 pieces of pottery and stone.

Later there was a Roman villa at nearby Wykham Park.

The area was settled by the Saxons around the late 5th century AD. In about AD 556 Banbury was the scene of a battle between the Anglo-Saxons of Cynric and Ceawlin and the local Romano-British. Banbury developed in the Anglo-Saxon era under Danish influence, which started in the late 8th century AD. It was assessed at 50 hides in the Domesday Book and was then held by the Bishop of Lincoln.

The Saxons built Banbury on the west bank of the River Cherwell. On the opposite bank they built Grimsbury, which was part of Northamptonshire but was incorporated into Banbury in 1889. Neithrop was one of the oldest areas in Banbury, having first been recorded as a hamlet in the 13th century. It was formally incorporated into the borough of Banbury in 1889.

Medieval history
Banbury's mediæval prosperity was based on wool.

The manors of Banbury and Cropredy existed by 1086 and probably included all those places known to be in the hundred in 1279: Banbury, Cropredy, Hardwick, Great Bourton, Little Bourton, Neithrop, Calthorpe, Coton, Wardington, Williamscot, Prescote, Claydon, Shutford, Wickham, Swalcliffe, Swalcliffe Lea, Charlbury, Cote, Finstock, Fawler, and Tapwell. Although the extra-parochial district of Clattercote was first included among the vills of Banbury hundred in 1665 and it had formed part of the Bishop of Lincoln's estates and seems to have been included as part of Claydon in 1279. The Bishop was reportedly also interested in several parts of land around Kineton and Bicester in the latter part of the 1270s as well.

The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Drayton had a water mill, probably set on the Sor Brook, on the western boundary of the parish just below the village. There is then a gap of five centuries in which no mill is recorded: but records resume with a mill operating in the parish from 1589 until 1851.

Banbury Castle was built in 1135 by Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and survived into the English Civil War, when it was destroyed.

Medieval Banbury was badly hit by the Black Death of 1348–49 as it probably killed half the population of the town, but it quickly grew and had a population of about 1,600 for the next 300 years.

For centuries, trade in wool, ale, cakes and cheese created wealth for the town. Wool was first referred to in 1268, and cheese was manufactured from the 15th to the 18th centuries. By the late 14th century Epwell village, formerly part of Dorchester hundred, began to be included in Banbury hundred. The Abbots of Eynsham early acquired many of the land rights in Charlbury formerly belonging to the Bishops of Lincoln, including by the year 1363 a 3 weeks' court and a portmoot. The payment of 3s, 4d. were payable to the town's hundred bailiff recorded in both 1372 and 1373, which was perhaps made in connexion with the view of a frankpledge, at which the constable of Banbury had to be present as well as the abbot's steward for the hundred.

In 1247 the hundred of Banbury was valued at £5 (100 shillings) a year and in 1441 certainty money due from the northern part of the hundred was 89s. 8d It was made up of payments from Shutford, Claydon, Swalcliffe, Great Bouton and Little Bourton, Prescote, Hardwick, Calthorpe and Neithrop, Wickham, Wardington, Williamscot, Swalcliffe Lea, and the former prebend of Banbury, and 69s. 4d. in 1652, when the total profits of court were valued at 103s. 4d. a year in certainty money. In 1875 payments were made only by Williamscot, Swalcliffe, Prescote, Great and Little Bourton, Neithrop, Claydon, and Shutford since the rest had been freed from their rent obligations.

The Bishop of Lincoln's extensive Banbury estate, excepting Neithrop and Calthorpe, was sold to the Duke of Somerset in 1547, but by 1550 he granted it, excepting Hardwick to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, then to the Duke of Northumberland shortly afterwards, who in turn granted it to the Crown in 1551 in exchange for other lands.

Long before enclosure, the tenants of Neithrop had become freeholders, as recorded in the land deeds of 1583 to 1608 and 1614, with the permission of both Sir Anthony Cope and his son Sir William Cope.

In about 1629 Sir William Cope, 2nd Baronet. sold a large area of land at Drayton to William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele of Broughton Castle. By 1790 this property belonged to Francis North, 1st Earl of Guilford of Wroxton Abbey. In 1935 and 1942 the Norths then sold their lands at Drayton to Trinity College, Oxford.

During the English Civil War

Banbury was partially destroyed by a fire in 1628. It played an important part in the English Civil War as an operational base for Oliver Cromwell, who is reputed to have planned the Battle of Edge Hill in the back room of an inn, then The Reindeer and now Ye Olde Reine Deer Inn. The town was pro-Parliamentarian, but the castle was manned by a Royalist garrison. In 1645 Parliamentary troops were billeted in nearby Hanwell village for nine weeks and villagers petitioned the Warwickshire Committee of Accounts to pay for feeding them.

The Civil War helped develop Banbury's industry. Kings Sutton was a local centre for saltpetre digging, and the Royalist garrison was at work early in 1645 quarrying it there and making it into gunpowder in a specially built house near Banbury. Just over 10 years previously a government saltpetreman had operated at Banbury for a year, having moved there from the then small market town of Coventry, before moving on to Hook Norton a short while afterwards.

The Civil War and the short two sieges noticeably damaged town's prosperity. Two members of the Vivers family and two fellow Banburians petitioned Parliament for an official redress compensation in 1646 and 1647. They claimed the principal looter was a captain in the King's garrison at Banbury Castle. Another self-proclaimed sufferer was the mercer Edward Russell, who after nearly being executed for trying to suborn the Royalist officers to turn Parliamentarian was jailed for three months in 1644. He also claimed his shop and house were looted and destroyed by the castle's Royalist garrison The garrison was soon defeated and the castle partly demolished using gunpowder. The Parliamentarian forces appeared to have also used the River Cherwell for access to Banbury at one point and briefly set up camp in the location of the present day Canalside trading estate, next to the public gallows. In 1649 dissaffected soldiers of the New Model Army mutinied. Being a mutiny and in Banbury, it became known as the Banbury mutiny. The mutineers did not achieve all of their aims and some of the leaders were executed on 17 May 1649.

1660 to 1834

Quaker missionaries had been active in the Banbury area in the Commonwealth period of the 1650s, and after the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy one Edward Vivers bought land in Banbury in 1664 to build a Friends' Meeting House. This was replaced with a Georgian building in Horsefair in 1751, to which a Tuscan porch was added in about 1820. Several Quaker communities in and around Banbury were recorded in the Visitation Returns of Thomas Secker, Bishop of Oxford in 1738.

Villagers farmed the parish on a two-field open field system until 1768, when Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet bought out the rights of copyholders, life- and leaseholders and enclosed the common lands.

The opening of the Oxford Canal from Hawkesbury Junction to Banbury on 30 March 1778 gave the town a cheap and reliable supply of Warwickshire coal. In 1787 the Oxford Canal was extended southwards, finally opening to Oxford on 1 January 1790. The canal's main boat yard was the original outlay of today's Tooley's Boatyard.

Before the arrival of the Oxford Canal in 1779, the Canalside area was undeveloped, low-lying watermeadows. The canal was then extended to Oxford by Banbury's engineer, John Barnes in 1790. Both Parker's Wharf and Bridge Wharf were serviced by fly-boats to many distant cross country destinations and by market boats to Oxford and Coventry. The canal brought much growth and prosperity to Banbury over the years and is still popular with boat users today. The canal's main boat yard is now the listed site today's Tooley's Boatyard.

The Cobb family may have obtained The hundred of Banbury when they bought the land site of Banbury castle in 1792 and in 1853 Edward Cobb was lord of the hundreds of Banbury and Bloxham.

The council objected to the planting of trees in Horse Fair Road, and in 1826 John Walford was then accused of injuring trees planted by the town's commissioners which he considered, like the trees they were planting, to be a waste of money. The commissioners were heckled as a rioting mob destroyed all the trees and fences.

1835 to 1912

The Banbury Poor Law Union formed 3 April 1835 and a Workhouse was built in Neithrop.

In 1836 by the town council took over the running of Banbury and the right to erect gas-works was relinquished in 1833 to the Banbury Gas Light and Coke Company.

One of the first acts of the town's newly appointed Paving Commissioners in 1825 was to appoint a committee to report on the condition of the town's streets. In 1826 the streets were reportedly paved with official approved Yorkshire flagging stones at a cost of over £3,000, but by 1840 it was noted that, as 'poor quality' stone had been used, the kerb was considered worthless. Between 1852 and 1888 the Local Board of Health continued the official supervision of streets, laid out several new roads, and started numbering the houses for identification and postal purposes.

Living conditions had improved greatly in Victorian times with the removal of several poorly built cottages that were deemed to be only 'hovels' and a reduction in childhood ill health in the early 19th century. Many cottages in the district of 'Waterloo', which apparently lay just east of Banbury Bridge to the north of the road, had been transformed after the early 19th century so that by 1841 'Waterloo' was considered one of the better off parts of Grimsbury. Banbury was booming, and Grimsbury's principal expansion occurred between 1852 and 1881, when some 500 houses were built, around Middleton Road, Causeway, Merton Street, Duke Street, and North Street.

In 1889, the hamlets of Grimsbury and Nethercote, Banbury became part of Banbury, before this time they were considered to be part of Warkworth in Northamptonshire, although they were both part of the Banbury (UK Parliament constituency) since 1832.

Banbury's Freehold Land Societies came into existence in the 1840s as part of a new pro-Democracy political movement inspired, organised by Liberal Radicals to effect Parliamentary Reform. Liberalised Banbury's offshoot was a settlement in New Grimsbury. The hamlet was originally called Freetown in the 1840s. Early in 1851 an audience of 300 attended a rally led by James Taylor of Birmingham lecture in Banbury on Freehold Land Societies. Mr Taylor was a disciple of the Unitarian minister George Dawson, and thus became a vigorous crusader for the working-classes.

The first two railways to reach Banbury opened in 1850. Firstly the Buckinghamshire Railway opened the Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line from  on the London and North Western Railway via  and  to a terminus at Merton Street. Within months the Oxford and Rugby Railway from  on the Great Western Railway via the Cherwell Valley opened a station at Bridge Street. The GWR extended the Oxford and Rugby Railway northwards in 1852. In 1900 the Great Central Railway opened a branch line to Banbury from Culworth Junction on its main line.

Upper and Lower Cherwell Streets and Windsor Street had also been built before 1851 as the town first began to grow. Neithrop expanded further between 1850 and 1881, with new housing providing for the Municipal Borough of Banbury's planned slum clearance from 'Waterloo' in Grimsbury and to deal with the then growing population and for the expanding population. This was followed by the building between Windsor Street and Broad Street so that by 1881 there were some 350 then modern houses in the whole area. The street known as Back Lane began converted into Castle Street West, as Castle Street East was created as part of a slum clearance from central Banbury in 1852.

A Quaker Pastor was one of the leading figures in Banbury and set up its first two water treatment works in the 1860s.

In the early 1870s the east side of Regents Place was developed by a William Wilkins between 1852 and 1871.

A large demonstration occurred in Banbury in July 1875 against the Vaccination Act of 1874. The demonstration was held to celebrate the release from Northampton Gaol of a man who had been imprisoned for 14 days after refusing to allow his child to be vaccinated. Musical bands and crowds met him at Banbury railway station, and he was presented with a purse of gold.

Duke Street, was located at the edge of Wilkins' (now demolished) brick pit, was developed around 1870. South of the Causeway, the newly designated Merton Street was developed by various speculators between the years of 1873 and 1882. It is worth noting the cramped development of the housing on the Causeway and Merton Street (known locally as the 'Railway Terraces') that built by the Great Western Railway, for the company's workers to use on payment of a rent to the GWR. This can be compared with the then contemporary, but more generous, development of the freehold land estate with its forward looking 'build-to-own' policy and public ethos. Development of site in the area continued into the twentieth century, Avenue Road constructed in 1911 being a case in point. Allotments began to encroached on the mostly closed clay pit by 1923.

Banbury town council also built the houses in King's Road and on the Easington estate at that time. More houses were built for the working population at the south end of Britannia Road and the area to the east between 1881 and 1930, and also in both Old Grimsbury Road and Gibbs Road in Grimsbury, and more up-market houses were built in both the Marlborough Road area and in Bath Road, Kings Road, Park Road, and Queen Street in Neithrop. The mostly late 19th-century suburb of Grimsbury witnessed rapid growth between 1881 and 1930. The former church hall of Christ Church, (now known as Oriel House), the former nonconformist chapel on Gatteridge Street, now the Kingdom Hall and the former Mechanics Institute on Marlborough Road all built in 1884. Part of and the former Mechanics Institute is now divided Banbury Public Library.

In 1891 the local medical officer for Banbury found that 62 cottages were dangerously filthy, 63 had defective drains, and 21 no water supply. By 1900, Banbury had a population of 12,968.

The land that was Peoples' Park had been enclosed in Hanoverian times and was set up as a private park in 1890 and opened in 1910, along with the adjacent bowling green.

The mostly late 19th-century suburb of Grimsbury witnessed rapid growth between 1881 and 1901.

1913-1946
In 1911 many people were living in houses unfit for human habitation. The Municipal Borough of Banbury set up a housing committee which some houses were built in Kings Road. The Banbury Co-operative Society completed 12 houses in 1913 in Hightown Road.

The 1919 Housing Act was followed by the building of the Easington housing estate of 361 council houses in what was one of the first slum clearance schemes in the country. By 1930 the town's medical officer reported 131 houses still unfit for habitation. So in 1933 Banbury council opened the Ruscote housing estate of 160 houses. The heavily increased population between 1931 and 1949 was accommodated by the expansion of the town in three main areas, in each of which houses were built both by the town corporation and by private housing companies. Between the Oxford and Bloxham roads about 500 houses were built before 1939 to form the bulk of the suburb of Easington, and in the area of the older village and suburb of Neithrop some 500 houses were built before 1939 both around the earlier houses and further west in new streets on either side of the Warwick Road, a development which was extended to the south-west after 1945.

Broughton Road and the West Bar area were mostly built in 1922, with a few building like the Gothic Villa dating from 1871 and the neighbouring West Bar Surgery GP's practice dating from the early 1960s. A total of 770 council houses were built between 1919 and 1940, and another 2,545 (including Withycombe Drive in 1947) during the period from 1945 to 1967 as the population began to grow significantly. The housing developments were mainly in the western parts of the town between the Warwick and Broughton roads, with others being built on the site of the former brickworks in Grimsbury. About 300 more houses were built after 1945. To the north of Grimsbury Square is the 1945–55 area of 'New Grimsbury' and south of it is the 1901 and earlier old town of 'Old Grimsbury'.

National Filling Factory, Banbury was built in World War I Production of filled shells began in April 1916 and ended in 1924. At height of the war gave employment to 933 men and 548 women, by 1919 they were down to 100 men and 72 women. It was closed in 1927.

A then confidential memorandum was sent to Horace Lester on 18 May 1917, by Captain Snowball with idea that the factory could be used for another manufacturing purpose after the war, like the motor depot at Slough Trading Estate had been listed for.

It was dismantlement years leading up to the Second World War and become a Home Guard ranting zone. Some Luftwaffe bombs dropped behind the Bowling Green in the 1940s since they feared it had been reactivated .

Part of it was cut through by the M40 and some is now the site close to the M40 and exit 11 (Banbury) that has been identified by developer Barwood as an appropriate location for the erection of industrial/distribution buildings.

There was a smaller satellite depot on the Middleton Road, Grimsbury, in Banbury during 1919 and it was reactivated in World War II. 20 World War II anti-tank phosphorus grenades and a small number of World War I phosphorus grenades were dug up by developers and defused by the army in 2012.

The Northern Aluminium Company, later the Aluminium Company of Canada (ALCAN) sheet rolling factory That had been was built to the north of Banbury in 1931 expanded again in the mid 30s to meet increased demand from the aircraft industry. (it employed 4,000 people at its war time peak, many of them women.) 60% of its war time metal came from Banbury, working in conjunction with an aluminium recycling plant near Adderbury which processed metal from crashed English and German air planes.

1947 to 1970

The town saw rapid expansion during the 1930s and 1940s as housing was built for newcomers from nearby towns and the emerging London overspill, and another 2,545 (including Withycombe Drive in 1947) during the period from 1945 to 1967 as the population began to grow significantly. The housing developments were mainly in the western parts of the town between the Warwick and Broughton roads, with others being built on the site of the former brickworks in Grimbury. A later expansion between the 1950s and 1970s would reach Hardwick, Ruscote, Easington, Bretch Hill and Poets' Corner, due to influxes from the London overspill and from the West Midlands.

In 1961 a total of 6,504 households were built, mostly in the style of those around Neithrop's Admiral Holland pub. 231 other, older buildings in the town centre still had no indoor toilets, 1,325 had no fixed baths, 1,643 had no hot water taps, and 98 had no cold water tap.

The land south of the Foscote Private Hospital in Calthorpe, Oxfordshire and Easington farm were mostly open farmland until the early 1960s as shown by the Ordnance Survey maps of 1947, 1964, 1955 and 1961. It had only a few farmsteads, the odd house, an allotment field-come-rugby pitch (now under the Sainsbury's store), and the Municipal Borough of Banbury council's small reservoir just south Easington farm and a water spring lay to the south of it. Two minor streams ran from a spring near the allotment gardens and the land under today's Timms estate. An old clay pit, kiln and brick works lay near the Poets' Corner estate. The pit was of mid Victorian origin and the buildings were put up by the issuing of the 1881 O.S. map. The pit had been filled in by the 1920s, the buildings closed by the 1940s and the site was built on by the late 1960s. Bankside road was constructed from 1965 to 1975 in a north to south direction as the local street testifies to.

The Woodgreen swimming pool was opened on 23 May 1939 and renovated in the late 1970s. It was closed in the early 2000s, heavily renovated in 2009 and reopened in 2010. The much frequented outdoor pool is closed from September to March due to the bad seasonal weather

The Ruscote estate, which now has a notable South Asian community, was expanded in the 1950s because of the growth of the town due to the London overspill and further grew in the mid-1960s.

British Railways closed Merton Street station and the Buckingham to Banbury line to passenger traffic at the end of 1960. Merton Street freight depot continued to handle livestock traffic for Banbury's cattle market until 1966, when this to was discontinued and the railway dismantled. In March 1962 Sir John Betjeman celebrated the line from Culworth Junction in his poem Great Central Railway, Sheffield Victoria to Banbury. British Railways closed this line too in 1966.

Life after 1970
Banbury's growth accelerated after the 1970s with the completion of the M40 motorway which gave faster access to London and Birmingham. By the 1971 census the town's population was 26,540, in 1977 it was 28,520 and by 2001 it had reached 41,802 for the town and 43,867 including the outlying villages such as Drayton. In 2002 an estimate for the town went as far as 46,800 in total. Most of the Hardwick estate built in the 1970s because of the growth of the town due to the Birmingham overspill and a slum clearance scheme in Smethwick. Some Welsh families have moved in since. It was expanded further in the mid-1980s. The main shopping facility is the now partly closed Hardwick arcade. Trinity Close was mostly built between 1973 and 1975, while both New Grimsbury and Bretch Hill continued to grow in the 1980s according to the O.S. street maps of those times.

Trinity Close and Powys Grove they were originally created as separate entities between the late 1960s and early 1980s as the 1973, 1977 and 1983 Ordnance Survey maps help to illustrate. It may be noted that Bretch Hill Road may have remained a long cul-de-sac and not reached the main road if the long planned Banbury by-pass had gone ahead in the 1970s. The housing around Appleby Close was built in the 1970s and might have been replaced by a proposed link between the by-pass and Bretch Hill, if the project had gone ahead. Since then there has been much redevelopment work, with the demolition of the old lock-up garages between (approx) Appleby Close and Edinburgh Close making way for a car park and a small housing development.

Banbury used to have Western Europe's largest cattle market, which was on Merton Street in Grimsbury. For many decades, cattle and other farm animals were driven there on the hoof from as far as Scotland to be sold to feed the growing population of London and other towns. Since its closure in June 1998 a new housing development has been built on its site which includes Dashwood Primary School.

The town was renovated in 1981 and partly pedestrianized in 1991. Bretch Hill's Thornbury Drive was put up for sale in 2000. The Hanwell estate, which lies between Banbury and Hanwell, was built in between 2005 and 2006, on the grounds of the former Hanwell Farm, which has become one of the constant houses, due to the natural growth of the town's commuter population.

Recent crime and anti-social behaviour
There was a 200 strong riot in the Market Place in 1988, which was quickly brought under control by the police.

There have been some concerns over antisocial behaviour and heavier than average litter levels in Princess Diana Park and Hillview Park, and also about fly-tipping in Banbury which affects some streets and footpaths such as on the Ironstones' paths.

17 August 2011 saw only minor scuffles in Banbury as the national riots passed Banbury by.

Local redevelopment plans

Woodgreen's 45-year-old youth club was closed in April, 2010, demolished during July 2010, and its replacement is due to open in early 2011. The redevelopment plan was valued at £3 million.

There was a plan in the late 2000s to expand the Bretch Hill estate westwards into local farmland, but this has now been suspended due to the credit crunch and local hostility to the plan, including the southern expansion towards Bodicote.

The Hanwell Fields Estate was built in the north during 2008 and 2009. It was intended to provide affordable social housing to the west and south of Banbury, and more upmarket housing in the Hanwell fields area.

Over the past few years there have been plans to build a new estate on the undeveloped College Fields adjoining both Bodicote and the Cherwell Heights housing estate of Banbury. In February 2006 Cherwell District Council voted to approve the plans despite a 20,000 signature petition against it. About 1,070 houses will be built in the estate, which will include local shops, a public house, a church, a restaurant, a school and other local services.

The former Penryth Road/Appleby Close play-park (approx.) was closed and the facilities (a roundabout, bench, bicycle rack and spring rider) were removed in the 1990s due to vandalism. The area may now be redeveloped as a car park.

Castle Quay, a shopping centre in Banbury, is subject to a redevelopment plan. This plan is to increase the size of the centre and add more facilities, such as a cinema. The car parks are in the process of being demolished, one at a time so that shoppers in cars can still place their car in a car park. This process is set to be complete in 2021, but this date may be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Industry and commerce

Before 1639

The Domesday Book in 1086 listed 3 mills, with a total fiscal value of 45 shillings, on the Bishop of Lincoln's demesne lands, and a fourth which was leased to Robert son of Waukelin by the Bishop. Among Banbury's four Medieval mills was probably a forerunner of Banbury Mill, first referred to by this name in 1695. In the year 1279, Laurence of Hardwick was also paying 3 marks (equivalent to 40 shillings) in annual rent to the Bishop for a mill in the then Hardwick hamlet.

The fore-runners of Butchers Row were probably long standing butchers' stalls which were known to be in situ by 1438.

1639 to 1870
In 1639, the woollen cloth draper Robert Vivers, who was also lessee of the prebendal estate, owned the Banbury Mill. In 1648 he sold it to Londoners Edward Darnelly, who was apothecary and his friend, the bowyer Thomas Brightwell, and in 1671 Mr Darnelly leased the mill windmill in Easington, for £44 a year to Samuel Bradford, the owner of Moor Mill in Oxford. Banbury's first major printer was John Cheney. He started out in 1765 as the innkeeper of the 'Unicorn' inn by next year he started selling paper as a side-line he had is known to have set up as a jobbing-printer by 1767. A boat-building yard was opened in 1790 on the canal at the end of Factory Street and boats were built there until the canal ceased to be used for commercial transport. In the 18th century New Bank (and later called the Gillett Bank) had also been Richard Tawney, who was the owner of a major brewery at Oxford. The coming of the railway enhanced Banbury's position as a market town, local economic epicentre and regional centre. This was the main factor behind the expansion of the New Bank under Joseph Ashby Gillett and his successors. The Cobbs' factory for ""weaving, webbing, and horsecloths"" was founded around 1700 and continued in production until 1870. In the early 19th century the most successful brewery in Banbury was the one owned by Thomas Hunt's, opened in Bridge Street just before 1847. A blacking factory was also opened by 1832 and it had five employees in 1851, but closed around 1872. The Italianate Elms House on Oxford Road, is a substantial villa built in 1863 for Jonathan Gillet, one of the senior partners of Gillet's Bank, is now the offices of the Primary Care Trust, which lies within the grounds of the Horton Hospital site.

The Canalside area began to develop became a centre of Banbury's agricultural, transport, and electrical engineering industry at about the same time as the arrival of the railways in 1850. By the year 1861 the Britannia Works agricultural machinery plant had become by far the largest single enterprise, employing 380 men and boys, and the Vulcan Foundry industrial railway and steam engine works employed between 40 and 50 people. Until the mid-19th century Banbury's trade and industry were based mostly on the products of agriculture and stock raising, with a modest volume of weaving, milling, baking, brewing and boat building.

The agricultural implements and milling equipment works at the Vulcan Foundry, was begun in 1837 by the firm of Lampitt and Co., a local firm that was established two years earlier by Mr Lampitt. Both Charles Lampitt produced a mobile steam-engine in 1847, and John Lampitt invented systems of 2-speed gearing and 3-speed gearing for traction engines. Among the various products of the works were portable and fixed industrial steam engines and a major industrial steam engine which supplied the power for the Hunt Edmunds Brewery for 90 years. Other engineering firms included Barrows and Carmichael, the Cherwell Engineering Works, a local branch of the Mr. Humphris Built Traction Engines in a workshop in North Bar Street.

At the Great Exhibition of 1851 exhibits by firms and individuals from Banbury included the following items and displays:

 A Charles Lampitt horse-seed-driller,
 Britannia Works agricultural machinery,
 An anti-attrition threshing machine,
 Various pharmaceutical preparations,
 A public demonstration of the action of phosphate of lime and magnesia on the soil,
 Inflated saddles,
 Plushes,
 Various mohair, hemp and sackcloth, blacking, mangles with mahogany tables and
 A lady's ornate walnut work-table.

The coming of the local railways made possible the expansion of the approximately 200-year-old agricultural implement manufacturing business in Banbury. The Britannia Works company's site was set up by Sir Bernard Samuelson from the earlier foundry established by James Gardner. Sir Samuelson had obtained a licence to make McCormick reapers by 1851, and by 1859 the firm was producing numerous agricultural machines, including turnip cutters, a patent digging and forking machine, a patent reaping machine, and lawn mowers. The firm also built the now demolished railway viaduct at Hook Norton. By 1881 the production of the company's produce was carried out at two separate works in south-east Banbury, which were linked by a tramway with a depot beside the railway, south of the Great Western Railway's station. Britannia Works was one of the town's major employers until the 1920s.

1869 to 1964

In 1870 Mr. T. R. Cobb sold his web-girth making mill to a company that later became the Banbury Tweed Co. Grain, brewing, wool and cloth were the centuries-old trade of Banbury, but the Banbury Tweed Co. factory finally closed its factory in 1932, bringing an end to an era. The historic background to Banbury's industry began with a few grain merchant's mills and weavers' looms under the Normans and this was continuing in some form until the last tweed factory closed in the 1920s, despite of the then new industry's like the nearby lime kiln and cabinet manufacture works, Neithrop's timber yard or Grimbury's clay pit and clay kilns.

The economic decline from the 1870s until the 1920s slowed down the rate of urban expansion as the various sawmills, timber yards, flour mills, a tweed factory, a lime kiln and a malthouse all closed. Grimsbury and Neithrop were the centres of the timber trade, while the rest was largely set along the canalside, apart from a few clay pits outside the town.

Duke Street, was located at the western edge of Wilkins' (now demolished) brick pit, was developed around 1870. There was a substantial 'brick, tile and drain works' with a short tramway in it to the east of Grimsbury in the versinaty of Howard Street according to the 1882, 1883 1900, 1910, 1922 1923 and 1947 Ordnance Survey maps. It had closed by 1923 and the last workshops had shut in 1955. It was mostly built on by 1965 according to the 1955 and 1965 O.S. maps.

Co-operative Society built their shop in Broad Street during 1907 and it offices at the Art Deco Banbury Co-operative Building in 1920. They had moved on by 1935.

In 1917 the Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway opened between an iron ore quarry north of Wroxton and a junction on the GWR just north of Banbury. It was heavily used during the Second World War but closed in 1967. Heavy clay and Ironstone deposits surround Banbury.

The growth of Banbury's population had nearly stopped by the 1920s, and people left the town as its market and its economic importance in the district declined: it is recorded that only 9,700 animals were sold there in the whole of 1924, compared with 6,300 at the town's Michaelmas Fair alone in 1832. The town's existing industries were mostly unsuccessful and in steady decline. The Banbury Tweed Co. closed its factory in 1932 and the Britannia Works, which made agricultural machinery, closed in 1933. But in the 1930s the town's economy became more diversified and less closely linked with the surrounding countryside and towns such as Daventry, Bloxham, Bicester and Southam. In 1927 a large factory for corsets and surgical supports (Spencer Corsets Ltd) opened in a disused clothing factory in Britannia Road, and the manufacture of electrical equipment by Switchgear and Equipment Ltd. started in 1932, first in part of the disused machinery Britannia Works; it moved to a newly built factory on the Southam road around 1939. New industries continued to be attracted to Banbury after the Second World War, and in the 1950s the council established the Southam Road Industrial Estate, which attracted a wide range of industrial installations and works to the town. The 60-year-old cabinet works near The Mill centre and the Cherwell Engineering works on the Canalside estate also closed in the late 1950s.

In the late 1920s the economy of Banbury was revolutionised by the arrival of new industries and in particular by the relocation of the out of town livestock market to Grimsbury it used to be held in Neithrop and/or Bridge Street, Banbury. The new site selected due to its proximity to the railway station.

The Northern Aluminium Co. Ltd. or Alcan Industries Ltd. pig and rolled aluminium factory was opened in 1931 on land acquired in 1929 on the east of the Southam road, in the then hamlet of Hardwick. The various Alcan facilities on the  site closed between 2006 and 2007. The factory was demolished between 2008 and 2009. The laboratory was also closed in 2004 and demolished in 2009.

The Northern Aluminium Company (ALCAN) sheet rolling factory That had been was built to the north of Banbury in 1931 expanded again in the mid 30s to meet increased demand from the aircraft industry. (it employed 4,000 people at its war time peak, many of them women.) 60% of its war time metal came from Banbury, working in conjunction with an aluminium recycling plant near Adderbury which processed metal from crashed English and German air planes.

After the Second World War the increasing industrialization of the town led to a great enlargement of the urban area, the chief residential features being extension in the northwest and, north of the Warwick Road, westward between the Warwick Road and Bloxham Road, in the south around the Easington estate and on the west bank of the Oxford canal, principally, the Cherwell Heights. The industrial building has continued on both sides of the Southam road and in the late 1950s the council acquired  of land on the west side of the road for an Industrial Estate to house the influx of planned new .

Life after 1964
Another major employer is General Foods Ltd, now Kraft Foods, which produced convenience foods, including custard and instant coffee. The company moved to Banbury from Birmingham in 1965. Kraft Foods Banbury has become an icon of the town's economic rebirth after the mid-1960s. The Fine Lady Bakeries also opened in the 1950s and expanded its local operations in 1965.

In the central area were built many large shops, a bus station, and a large car park north of Castle Street. In 1969 proposals for the redevelopment of the central area were in hand, leading to the creation of the Castle Quay shopping centre in 1977 and the nearby multi-story car park in 1972. The 1977 plans to build another multi-storey car park on what is now the open air car park behind Matalan and Poundland were scrapped in 1978 and another one was built to the rear of the Castle Quay shopping mail in 1978.

The former Hunt Edmunds brewery premises became Crest Hotels headquarters, but closed in the late 1970s and was abandoned in the late 1980s, while the Crown Hotel and the Foremost Tyres/Excel Exhausts shops found new owners after they closed in 1976 due to falling sales. Hella Headlamps, a vehicle headlamps firm closed its 20-year-old factory on the Beaumont Industrial Estate in the mid-2000s. The local ironmonger, Hoods, opened in the mid-1960s and closed circa 2007, with the shop becoming part of the then enlarged Marks and Spencer shop.

Banbury has several shops in suburban local centres and in the town centre. There is a market held on Thursdays and Saturdays in the market place, as well as a farmers' market on the first Friday of every month.

A shopping centre, Castle Quay, is in the centre of Banbury. It opened as the Castle Shopping Centre in 1977 to cover the former Factory Street, before being expanded over the Castle Garden allotments in the 1990s. The centre has over 80 stores including well-known names such as Marks & Spencer, Bhs, WH Smiths, F. Hinds (jewellers), JJB Sports and Debenhams.

There are many local convenience shops scattered about the town in places like the Ruscote Arcade, Hardwick Arcade and Bradley Arcade.

Kraft Foods, Banbury

Kraft Foods in the Ruscote ward of Banbury operate a large food and coffee producing factory in the north of the town. It was built in 1964, partly due to the London overspill. The factory is still sometimes known as General Foods after the American company which originally owned the building before it was taken over by Kraft. In October 2006 a building at Kraft Foods that was being prepared for demolition caught fire. There was also a small fire at the coffee plant on 7 December 2010.

Industrial estates

The Tramway and Canalside industrial estates

The Tramway industrial estate and Canalside estate are mostly built on land once owned by the Britannia Works. The Tramway industrial estate is named after the industrial tramway that ran between factories on Windsor Street, Upper Windsor Street, Canal Street, Tramway Street and the plant next to Banbury station and the station's corporate freight siding between around 1881 and 1935. The estate is now a home to many businesses like the Stagecoach bus depot, a Wacky Wardrobe fancy-dress shop, Magnet Kitchens' show, Teamtalk clothing limited room and a small local oil tanker depot by the station.

The other industrial estates

The mid-1950s saw the council established the Southam Road Industrial Estate. The estate was successful in bringing a wide range of industrial to the town. The most important newcomer at the time was General Foods Ltd, formerly Alfred Bird & Sons, and now Kraft Foods, which produced convenience' foods, like custard and instant coffee. The company moved to Banbury from Birmingham in 1965 and received active political and fiscal co-operation from the council. A new factory with a floor space  was being constructed in 1969 for Encase Ltd and a factory was being built for Demag Hoists and Cranes Ltd., a subsidiary of Demag Zug, one of the world's largest manufacturers of lifting equipment. The industrial estate had become one of the 'economic epicentres' of the Banbury region by the early 1970s.

The Overthorpe industrial estate was built in the 1960s and 1970s and the Wildmear industrial estate was created in the late 1970s and early 1980s, over the former farm house, small late Victorian local swimming pool and pond as the 1973 and 1983 Ordnance Survey maps show. The Thorpe Way industrial estate, which is next to the long established spittle fields sewerage works, started up in the 1950s and grew further towards the Overthorpe industrial estate (which is named after the nearby village of Overthorpe, Northamptonshire) in the 1960s.

Farming

Banbury once had Western Europe's largest cattle market, on Merton Street in Grimsbury. The market was a key feature of Victorian life in both the town and countryside. In the late 1920s, the economy of Banbury was revolutionised by the arrival of new industries, in particular by the relocation of the out of town livestock market to Grimsbury It used to be held in Neithrop and/or Bridge Street, but moved to a part of Gimsbury next to Banbury station. The new site selected due to its proximity to the railway station. It was formally closed in June 1998, after being abandoned several years earlier and was replaced with a new housing development and Dashwood Primary School.

The Barber family were local landlords, who let out their Easington estate's lands, examples being Little Wood close was leased to a local man in 1690, the adjacent lands in Berrymoor to another in 1692. The Barber family's property in Easington was thus farmed as a whole by successive tenants until late Victorian times.

The land south of the Foscote Private Hospital in Calthorpe, Oxfordshire and Easington farm were mostly open farmland until the early 1960s as shown by the Ordnance Survey maps of 1964, 1955 and 1947. It had only a few farmsteads, the odd house, an allotment field (which briefly became a rugby ground and is now under the Sainsbury's store), and the Municipal Borough of Banbury council's small reservoir just south Easington farm and a water spring lay to the south of it.

Berrymoor farm was finally demolished in circa 2004 after many years of dereliction had made it unsafe to use and became today's St. Mary's View. Much of the farm land was used to build a children's day-care, an industrial storage facility, a small electrical substation, and a branch of De Montfort University (now a branch of the Oxford and Cherwell College) on in the late 1960s.

Bretch Farm, near Claypits close, opened in about 1900, was expanded slightly in 1910, lost a large part of its land to the Bretch hill development (the watertower and communications transmissions mast) in the 1960s, closed in 1990 and has lain derelict ever since.

The 2008–2010 credit crunch

The credit crunch and subsequent UK recession has led to unemployment rising sharply (it was only 1% in 2001 and 2002, but rose sharply c. 2007–2008). Several places closed, mostly between 2007 and 2011, but most have subsequently re-opened since. The Gloria Jean's café has reopened as Café Mocha, a Tescos Express store opened up in recently closed Grimsbury Pub/Restaurant, Buffalo Bills and Focus Do It All became Argos's second store. The SCS branch adjacent to the new Argos store has become a Next department outlet and the former Powerhouse electrical goods retailer (also situated on the retail park) became Pets at Home.

Bagel bite closed at 12 Market Place, BANBURY, OX16 5LG in 2009 after 3 years and returned in 2012 as Begle Dites at 12 Market Place, BANBURY, OX16 5LG.
 B-Wise became the Family Bargains discount store, the 99p shop before being burnt out in 2011; the old Littlewoods Index store became Wilkinsons and Peacocks, with the latter closing in 2012.

The Old Flyer closed in 2009 but reopened as the Old Auctioneer in 2011. The Yates night club closed in 2007, but had reopened  as the Also Known AS Nightclub. The local branch of The Officers Club had moved to a smaller store, but had also weathered the economic storm until 2012. The local branch of Woolworths is now a branch of H&M Clothing. The Littern Tree Pub closed in 2005 to be replaced by the J D Wetherspoons Fleur De Lis in 2008. Chalky's, a local music retailer formerly based on the High Street, had moved into Castle Quay shopping centre to accommodate a larger floor space; the recession had caused the store to cease operations and was closed only after a few months having been situated within Castle Quay in the Spring of 2009.

The Polish delicatessens – Grosik, the various new shops in the Hanwell Fields Housing Estate and a recruitment drive by Prodrive have reduced the unemployment levels over the latter part of 2010 as the local economy began to improve.

Mixed fortunes of 2012-2015
Arthur Whitcher Menswear, which was founded in 1955, closed in 2015, as did Thee Olde Sweet Shoppe earlier and Jessica's Sweet Shop in 2014.

A site close to the M40 and exit 11 (Banbury) was identified by developer Barwood as an appropriate location for the erection of several industrial/distribution buildings in 2012 and work began in 2014. British Airways, Fast Server and Prodrive have already bought some tenancies.

Local government
In January 1554 Banbury was granted royal charter that established legally the town as a borough to be thus governed by the aldermen of the town.

Until the year 1889 the Town Council's activities were limited to the administration of local justice, the town's 'morality goal', the police, markets, fairs, trading standards and the upkeep of municipal property. By 1889 its functions were extended to include the repairing, cleansing, and lighting of the streets, which had been the responsibility of the Paving Commissioners from 1825 until 1852 and of the Local Board of Health from 1852 until 1889, and then sewerage, all sanitary matters, hospitals, the cemetery, public baths, swimming pools, recreation grounds, parks and the local fire brigade for which the Local Board of Health had been responsible. The responsibility for elementary education passed into the town council's control under the Education Act 1902. Following the Reform Act of 1867, the three most important voting qualifications were being a man, the ownership of a freehold with a minimum value of 40 shillings and the occupation of a house worth at least £10 a year in rent moneys. This substantially enlarged the local electorate.

The town's supply of gas, electricity and water was in the hands of private companies until 1947, when the town council purchased the water company. In 1967, the water company's former undertakings and assets that had passed to the Municipal Borough of Banbury (the then town council) were absorbed into the Oxford and District Water Board. The council also lost control to the county councils of the police in 1925 and elementary education in 1944, and the local fire brigade in 1947. The hospitals were nationalized by Clement Attlee's Labour government in 1946.

Banbury was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Reform Act 1835. It retained a borough council until 1974, when under the Local Government Act 1972 it became part of the traditionally Conservative-ruled Cherwell District Council, an unparished area with Charter Trustees. A civil parish with a town council was set up in 2000.

Major schools

Banbury School

Former Cherwell British (Infants) School, and the old Dashwood school in Britannia Road was closed in the mid-2000s, with the new Dashwood school opening nearby.

Wykham Park Academy, previously Banbury School, is a mixed, multi-heritage, fully comprehensive school with 1,650 students including a sixth form. It is on Ruskin Road in the Easington ward of Banbury. The school is a specialist Humanities College.

Blessed George Napier Roman Catholic School
Blessed George Napier Roman Catholic School is on Addison Road, but also has an entrance on Springfield Avenue, in the Easington ward of Banbury. It caters for pupils from all areas of North Oxfordshire, primarily baptised Catholic children.

Drayton School

Drayton School was a comprehensive school with 650 students. It was on Stratford Road in Banbury. Its buildings are now used by the new North Oxfordshire Academy which succeeded it.

The school was opened in 1973 to relieve pupil demand for the over-subscribed Banbury School and was then exceed in two more stages. In its first year it was called Drayton Hall as it was affiliated to Banbury School. In 1974 it became independent and was renamed Drayton School. The school made local headlines in 1982 when pupils staged a rooftop protest in response to a teachers' strike.

Drayton school was known for its sports facilities, in particular the Astroturf and the athletics track, both owned by Cherwell District Council. As a result, Sport England gave the school a ""sportsmark"" award.

In December 1997 Ofsted placed the school in Special Measures following poor inspection results. Drayton was at the bottom of the league table for Oxfordshire, reaching an all-time low of 9% of pupils getting 5 or more A*-C grades in their GCSEs.

In September 1999 Graham Robb was appointed head teacher, with a mission to remove Drayton from special measures and for the school to pass a successful Ofsted inspection. By 2001, weaknesses in the curriculum and in teaching and learning had been addressed and the Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools (HMI) judged the school to have improved enough to be removed from Special Measures. As a result of the improvements between 1999 and 2001, the school received a 'School Achievement Award' in 2002. In the same year Drayton joined the ""Specialist School and Academies Trust"". In 2003 Drayton passed an Ofsted inspection.

April 2003 was a critical time for Drayton as Oxfordshire County Council wanted to merge Banbury School and Drayton School in the Banbury School and Blessed George Napier Roman Catholic site. Blessed George Napier Roman Catholic School wanted to move to the Drayton School site as the school was over-subscribed. Drayton School was also planning a joint campus with Oxford and Cherwell Valley College.

However, in the face of enormous opposition, due to the improved local reputation of the school, the County Council abandoned this proposal at an executive meeting in October 2003.

Examination results also improved during this period. The results of the SAT tests the students take at age 14 improved dramatically in 2003.

In July 2004, Graham Robb left Drayton School having achieved his two objectives. After the refurbishment he piloted, Drayton was one of the few schools in Oxfordshire to have achieved a ""Healthy Oxfordshire Schools"" award set by Oxfordshire County School.

In Summer 2006 Drayton achieved another all-time GCSEs record since it opened. It was then replaced by North Oxfordshire Academy in 2007.

North Oxfordshire Academy

North Oxfordshire Academy is a city academy in Banbury which opened in September 2007, replacing the former Drayton School. Its sixth form opened in September 2008. The Headteacher of North Oxfordshire Academy is Sara Billins.

At the end of the Summer Term 2007, two of the school's four main blocks, A Block and C block, were cleared and sealed off ready for refurbishment work that took place from September 2007 to the middle of 2009.

North Oxfordshire Academy is run by the United Learning Trust and sponsored by Vodafone.

In a recent Ofsted/HMI report the officials advised that the academy had innovative strategies was continuing to move in a positive direction.

The Warriner School

The Warriner School is a secondary school which opened in 1971 and is on Bloxham Road in Bloxham. It has 1,114 pupils in the 11–16 age range. It has Technology College status and serves the villages in the northern half of the Cherwell District. The school has a catering service and canteen, although school farm produce is not used for student consumption.

The school premises include a  farm and fully organic for livestock and grassland. The school has won the National Farmers Union's Rural School of the Year Award 2005 and Specialist Schools and Academies Trust's Most Improved Schools Club Award 2005–06. The farm sells its produce, including eggs, meat and livestock.

The Warriner Farm is used for pupil education, as Rural Studies lessons can be held on the farm, enabling teachers to demonstrate with live animals.

Water treatment and sanitation

Apart from assuming the functions of the Paving Commissioners, the Local Board of Health was responsible for sewage, sewers, town culverts, health, and all sanitary matters, etc. vial the local Sanitary Board. The Local Board of Health was unable to finance a regular supply of water to the town, so the responsibility was taken up by the Banbury Water Co. in 1854. They would also build a reservoir on land by the Oxford Road Banbury Water Co. was formed in 1854 to take water from the River Cherwell near Grimsbury, purify it by artificial (i.e. via a sand bed) filtration, and then pump it to a covered storage reservoir on land by the Oxford Road, but the works were not in operation until 1858.

Banbury has had three sewage works since the mid-19th century. They were planned out in the 1850s along with a water pumping station. The first was founded by a Quaker Pastor in the 1860s in the north of the then town, near the location of today's Spice Ball Park, and another a few years later under what is now the Beaumont Industrial Estate. Both of these had become obsolete and ceased operation in about 1910.

The public's opposition to a rate increase prevented the Local Board of Health from purchasing the water company in 1863. By 1870 the District Medical Officer urged the Local Board of Health and Sanitary Board that town's use of the company's water should be made obligatory. The Boards were concerned by any possible public backlash over the cost or assumed reduction in civil liberties that locals may have incurred due to the project.

In 1888 the local Sanitary Board and Local Board of Health were disbanded and its duties were taken over by the town council.

By 1900 the Banbury Water Co. was supplying nearly the whole town with water and by 1914 a service reservoir with a capacity of 250,000 gallons had been constructed on the west side of the Oxford Road. It was then slightly enlarged after the Second World War.

The local council, the Municipal Borough of Banbury had taken most local waterworks over by the 1880s, along with a small reservoir near Easington farm, and the Banbury Rural District had built another on the present Spitalfields site in the 1890s as the need for formal sewerage treatment as well as water purification grew as the town expanded ever outward as illustrated in the 1882, 1900, 1910 and 1922 Ordnance Survey maps. It would be expanded after the Second World War and modernised thereafter. Banbury Rural District built Grimsbury Reservoir and the Langford Lane water pumping stations near today's Hennef Way road in abbot the mid-1960s.

A water tower was built in Neithrop circa 1964.

Hospitals

The Horton General Hospital and Foscote Private Hospital are in the ward. The hospital has 236 beds and was founded in 1872 by Mary-Ann Horton. It was briefly threatened with closure in 2009, but this threat has now receded due to local pressure. It was modernised steadily from the 1960s onwards.

Transport

Waterways
The Oxford Canal is a popular place for pleasure trips and tourist activity. The canal's main boat yard is now the listed site Tooley's Boatyard.

Railways
The main station, now called simply Banbury after Merton Street closed in the 1960s, is now served by trains running between  and Birmingham via Reading, Oxford and Leamington Spa, and from London Marylebone via High Wycombe and Bicester, the fastest non-stop train taking 68 minutes to London Marylebone (and 62 minutes for the return journey).

Banbury has rail services run by Chiltern Railways to  and Birmingham, both running to London Marylebone via the non-electrified Chiltern Main Line. It also has services run by Great Western Railway to ,  and London Paddington. Services to other parts of the country are provided by CrossCountry south to Reading, Southampton and Basingstoke, and north to Manchester Piccadilly and Newcastle.

Buses
Midland Red was a former bus company that operated in the Midlands, and also into Oxfordshire. The first garage opened in the town during 1919, with an initial allocation of three buses that had increased to five vehicles by 1922. Some of the larger bus companies were nationalised in 1947, by the Attlee government; but BMMO, as part of the British Electric Traction group, was not nationalised until 1967.

Banbury's division was, later to join several other towns under the title of Midland Red South when Midland Red was split up on 6 September 1981. Midland Red South Limited was bought out by Stagecoach in late 1993. It traded as Stagecoach Midland Red. It became part of Stagecoach in Oxfordshire and was corporately merged with Thames Transit's country wide depot services in 2002.

Banbury has an intra-urban bus service provided by Stagecoach in Warwickshire which feeds the outlying villages and provides transport to places such as Oxford, Chipping Norton and Brackley. Stagecoach also now runs the intra-urban bus to Rugby and Daventry that was provided by Geoff Amos Coaches until they closed in August 2011. Heyfordian Travel operates smaller services not covered by those of Stagecoach including routes from Banbury to places including Bicester, the Heyfords, Ardley, Towcester, Wappenham and Northampton. A local operator - Tex Coaches also runs regular routes from Banbury Town Centre to Brackley via Kings Sutton and Greatworth. Banbury is also served by the National Express coach service which runs regular services in and out of Banbury, to/from major UK towns and cities.

The Banburyshire Community Transport Association Ltd charity provides special transport services for disabled in and around the town of Banbury.

Public roads
The M40 motorway now runs close to the west of the village of Aynho with the nearest access at junction 10, with the A43 trunk road about  south.

By the turn of the 1980s, plans had been unveiled to extend the motorway from Oxford to Birmingham through Banburyshire, Cherwell Valley and Warwickshire. This was constructed between 1988 and 1990 from Junction 8 joining the M42 (Junction 3A) near Hockley Heath.

There was a particularly nasty crash just north of Banbury in the winter of 1997, in which 1 person died and 9 were injured, due to a lorry hitting black ice and skidding into an oncoming tanker truck. Several cars were also later involved in the incident.

The Hennef Way bypass in central Banbury was built in 1985 to relieve town centre congestion and improve accessibility between the town and motorway. It was built between Grimbury's Old Manor farm and the Grimsbury Reservoir. The farm was demolished and replaced by an office and car show room. Hennef Way was named after the German town of Hennef. Hennef Way (A422) was then upgraded to a dual carriageway easing traffic on the heavily congested road and providing better links to north Banbury and the town centre from the M40.

A bypass was planned for the mid-1980s as both the 1983 and 1985 O.S. maps and a planning application of that time map show. The route would have been roughly from outside Drayton School, past Trinity Close and then through the still inbuilt part of Bretch Hill and Appleby close, past Dover Avenue, then beyond the water tower and communications mast (both made circa 1964), and into Easington via land just south of Crouch Hill and finally coming on to the main road south of the Poets' Corner or Timms estates. The Bretch Hill Road may have remained a long cul-de-sac not reached the main road near the Drayton School or have had Appleby and Penrith closes added to it, if the long planned Banbury bypass had gone ahead in the early to mid-1980s as the 1973, 1977, 1983 and Ordnance Survey maps help illustrate.

In 2005 Oxfordshire County Council proposed building a ring road around Banbury, connecting the M40 to the Oxford Road at Bodicote, to ease town centre traffic. However, this is not expected to be built until 2016 at the earliest.

Banbury United F.C.

Banbury United F.C. was first formed as Spencer Villa in 1931 and their home matches played at Middleton Road. At this time it was essentially a works club. In 1934, they changed their name to Banbury Spencer and moved to the Spencer Stadium. They had a lot of early success, winning most of the leagues which they played in.

Banburyshire

Banburyshire is an informal area () of England comprising the region within approximately 20 miles of the market town of Banbury. The county of Oxfordshire has two main commercial centres, the city of Oxford itself, which serves most of the south of the county, and Banbury, which serves the north (such as Adderbury, Deddington, Wroxton, Great Bourton and Bloxham), plus parts of the neighbouring counties of Northamptonshire and Warwickshire. Hook Norton brewery, on the outskirts of Banburyshire, is one of Britain's last working tower breweries (by April 2006) and supplies several Banbury and Oxfordshire pubs with beer.

From the former, the villages of King's Sutton and Middleton Cheney, and possibly also Aynho, Fenny Compton, Charlton and Croughton could be considered part of Banburyshire, and from the latter Upper and Lower Brailes also fall within Banbury's sphere of influence. Both the settlements of Bicester, Hinton-in-the-Hedges, Chipping Norton and Hook Norton are also on the border of Banburyshire's area.

It is effectively encompassed by the former Banbury Rural District, Woodstock Rural District, Municipal Borough of Banbury, Southam Rural District, Brackley Rural District, Middleton Cheney Rural District and the north west of Ploughley Rural District (the part that was not in either Bicester Rural District or Headington Rural District before 1931) local government areas, which were abolished between 1935 and 1974.

Roman and Anglo-Saxon events
During excavations for the construction of an office building in Hennef Way in 2002, the remains of a British Iron Age settlement with circular buildings dating back to 200 BC were found. The site contained around 150 pieces of pottery and stone. Later there was a Roman villa at nearby Wykham Park. Remains of a substantial Roman villa were found just west of the B4100 main road, near Hanwell, Oxfordshire. A Roman town once stood at Blacklands,  north of the village of King's Sutton and coins from the 4th century AD have been alo been found there.
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Vikings raided the village of Hook Norton in AD 913. Banburyshire, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire were on the Front line of the Viking/Anglo-Saxon conflict of that time. and a parish church was built there by AD 922. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Hook Norton had 76 villagers and two mills.

Cherwell Edge
Cherwell Edge in Northamptonshire () is near the River Cherwell, north-west of Banbury. The once heavily wooded hill and valley was mostly cleared by 1925 and the nearby golf courses were built in the early 1960s. The area now also covers the nearby Cherwell Edge Golf Club that was recently built by it to. The golf club is used by various local residents and is one of Banburyshire's leading courses.

Though she starred in numerous films, she is perhaps best known for her work in silent Western films.

A native of Montana, Ridgeway worked as both a vaudeville performer and a professional trick rider before making her film debut in 1916. She appeared in 63 films between 1916 and 1934, with prominent roles in Western films populating much of her early career. Other notable roles include supporting parts in Tod Browning's drama The Unpainted Woman (1919) and The Enemy (1927).

Ridgeway officially retired from acting in 1934, making her final screen appearance in Rouben Mamoulian's We Live Again. She spent the latter half of her life managing the Hotel del Tahquitz in Palm Springs, California, a hotel she built in 1928. She remained the proprietor of the Hotel del Tahquitz until her death in 1961. She was married to Russian composer Constantin Bakaleinikoff. In L.A. Exposed: Strange Myths and Curious Legends in the City of Angels, historian Paul Young noted Ridgeway as an ""iconoclastic silent film star.""

Early life
Ridgeway was born Frederick Berneice Hawkes on April 8, 1898 in Missoula, Montana, later moving with her family to Butte, Montana, where she attended primary school. Prior to establishing herself as a film actress, Ridgeway worked as both a vaudeville performer and as a trick rider. As a teenager, Ridgeway traveled with her family between Montana and California, and attended Hollywood High School in Los Angeles. She was also educated in Chicago.

Career

Early films
She made her film debut in the short The Bridesmaid's Secret (1916), and appeared the following year in her first feature film role in the Western The Hero of the Hour (1917). Ridgeway would appear in several silent Western shorts after, including The Wrong Man (1917) and The Soul Herder (1917). Her appearances in Westerns earned her the name of the ""cowgirl star"" early in her career. She appeared as Evelyn Hastings in the 1917 picture The Learnin' of Jim Benton opposite Roy Stewart, and was noted in a review for her ""delightful"" performance in the film.

In 1919, Ridgeway appeared in Victor Schertzinger's comedy When Doctors Disagree, followed by a supporting part in Tod Browning's drama The Unpainted Woman (1919) for Universal Pictures. She would continue to play in silent pictures into the late 1920s, including roles in the drama The Old Homestead (1922), the Western Ruggles of Red Gap (1923), and the drama The Enemy (1927), opposite Lillian Gish.

Later work and retirement
In 1932, she appeared in Ladies of the Big House, which received positive critical acclaim with a review in The New York Times noting: ""the film manages to convey this terror with a fair measure of success."" In 1934, she appeared in a supporting part in the horror film House of Mystery (1934) opposite Verna Hillie and John Sheehan. Ridgeway made her final screen appearance in a minor uncredited role in We Live Again (1934), an adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's Resurrection, before retiring from acting.

Ridgefield spent her remaining years managing the Hotel del Tahquitz, a 100-room hotel which she had built in Palm Springs, California in 1928.

Personal life
Ridgeway married Russian composer Constantin Bakaleinikoff in Cincinnati, Ohio on December 23, 1925. In March 1928, Ridgeway commissioned architect Anthony Miller to design a home for her, which was built in Los Angeles, California. She would later marry Walter D. Simm, whom she remained married to until her death of a heart attack in 1961.

She is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California.

966,56858272,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia%20Reid,Nadia Reid,"Nadia Reid (born 26 August 1991) is a singer-songwriter and guitarist from Port Chalmers, New Zealand. She has been acclaimed for her intimate musical soundscape and unique voice, and has been described by The Guardian as ""an understated"", wise guide through uncertain territory"" and by Revue as ""allegorical and often brutally honest"". Her three albums, Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs (2015), Preservation (2017), and Out of My Province (2020), have received acclaim in New Zealand and internationally.

Reid performs live with a regular band of musicians consisting of Sam Taylor (guitar), Richie Pickard (bass), and Joe McCallum (drums).

Early life
Born in Devonport, New Zealand, Reid is the daughter of Karin Reid and Craig O’Reilly. She was educated at Logan Park High School and Queen's High School. Reid began playing the guitar at 14, and went on to win best female musician in the Smokefreerockquest. She was a member of the Queen's madrigal choir, winners of the New Zealand Choral Federation (Otago) Millennium Trophy for secondary school choirs in 2009.

Career
At the age of 18, Reid moved to Christchurch and began performing her original songs. Several short EPs followed, and as opportunities to perform nationally arose she moved to Auckland, and then Wellington.

2014–2016: Crowdfunding and release of debut album
Reid was encouraged to work toward her first full-length album, and was already connected to Lyttelton-based producer Ben Edwards. Without startup capital, Reid set up a PledgeMe campaign, which was given a significant boost after she opened for Tiny Ruins.

This gave her a footing to record and self-release Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs at Edwards' Sitting Rooms Studios. In early 2015, Reid was signed to Australian indie label Spunk Records and the album was released officially in Australia and New Zealand. Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs was warmly received by critics, and in 2016 was nominated for a Tui award for best folk album and for the Taite Music Prize.

After a period living and playing shows in Australia, Reid returned home to Port Chalmers and began an English Degree at the University of Otago.

Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs was quickly licensed for UK, US and European release, which opened the door to Reid’s first tour of the UK and Europe in 2016.

2017–present: World tours and second album
Before leaving the country for the tour, Reid returned to the Lyttleton studio with Ben Edwards and her backing band where they recorded her sophomore album Preservation.

The tour was a success, and while in London, Reid was approached with a co-management offer with Melodic Records. This was followed by a publishing deal with Basin Rock Records and an endorsement from Crafter Guitars. Since its release on 3 March 2017, Preservation has been met with a positive reception.

Reid opened for Ryan Adams at his sold-out Auckland show on 20 May 2017.

Awards
Reid’s first single from ‘’Preservation’’, Richard, saw her nominated for the APRA Silver Scroll award in 2017, regarded as New Zealand’s most important songwriting award. Judges described the song as ""a stand-out folk-rock gem with its wonderfully direct delivery, charting heartbreak and dissolution, through striking imagery"".

Also in 2017, producer Ben Edwards won a New Zealand Music Award for his work on Preservation, and Reid herself was nominated for Best Solo Artist, Breakthrough Artist of the Year and Best Alternative Artist.

Film and television appearances
On 26 September 2017, Reid made her UK television debut with her band, appearing on Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two.

Story

In , a large company known as the Yggdrasill Corporation transformed the once bustling suburban city into a jōkamachi. To escape the resulting feeling of oppression, many of the youth in Zawame formed dance crews called Beat Riders to bring joy back into peoples' lives. Also rising in popularity is the Inves Game, a simulator that uses strange devices known as Lockseeds to summon monsters known as Inves. Kota Kazuraba, a member of the dance group Team Gaim, tries to find his place in the world while torn between his loyalty to his teammates and his sister Akira's insistence that he starts acting like an adult and find a proper job. When Team Gaim's captain disappears after informing Kota of a strange belt he found, Kota discovers that the Lockseeds and Inves are from an alternate dimension known as Helheim Forest. Encountering a mysterious girl resembling his Team Gaim teammate and close friend Mai Takatsukasa, Kota uses a Sengoku Driver belt and the Orange Lockseed to become a samurai-armored warrior that is later named Armored Rider Gaim. In the meantime, including Team Baron's leader Kaito Kumon as Armored Rider Baron and Kota's Team Gaim teammate Mitsuzane Kureshima as Ryugen, other Armored Riders appear to amass social power throughout Zawame: Team Raid Wild's Ryoji Hase as Kurokage, Team Invitto's Hideyasu Jonouchi as Gridon, and the perfectionist ex-soldier Oren Pierre Alfonso as Bravo. Unbeknownst to the Armored Riders, the Yggdrasill Corporation monitors them and the Inves Games while the head of its R&D division, Mitsuzane's older brother Takatora, is the enigmatic white Armored Rider Zangetsu who is protecting a dark secret hidden within Helheim Forest.

Eventually, when Kota confronts Takatora as he becomes a New Generation Armored Rider alongside the Armored Rider development scientist Ryoma Sengoku as Duke, his aide Yoko Minato as Marika, and the Lockseed Dealer Sid as Sigurd, he learns the horrible truth of Helheim Forest: that it was home to a once prosperous civilization that was eradicated by the strange plants growing throughout it, as anyone who consumed the fruit of these plants is turned into an Inves. Finding an ally in DJ Sagara, a pirate radio DJ who knows more than he is letting on such as the intelligent Overlord Inves, Kota finds himself in the middle of a Sengoku period-like brawl among various factions for the right to possess the power of Helheim Forest–the proverbial forbidden fruit itself–and the fate of life on Earth as he knows it. But while adamant to obtain the Golden Fruit to save the world, Kota's goal involves him having a predestined confrontation with Kaito who desires the fruit's power to shatter the status quo of the world.

Production and development

Trademarks on Kamen Rider Gaim were requested in May 20, 2013, and the show was officially announced on July 25, 2013. The series producer, Naomi Takebe, wanted Gaim to return to the style of early Heisei era series, in which multiple Riders are featured. Drawing inspiration from the Sengoku period, Bandai presented the idea of using fruits as a core theme to Takebe, which led to the creation of the Arms Change. Takebe approached Gen Urobuchi, known for Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero, to serve as the series main writer, and Ryuta Tasaki, who had previously worked on Kamen Rider Agito and Kamen Rider Ryuki, to direct. In an interview, Urobuchi states that Takebe requested that the series not follow the two-episode structure of recent series, as well as saying that he hopes to create the same kind of excitement he felt from Kamen Rider Black to a new generation. Urobuchi's company Nitroplus also assisted with designs.

The show's lead role went to 2011 Junon Super Boy Contest Grand Prix winner Gaku Sano, portraying Kota Kazuraba. Sano said that he grew up wishing he could be the character from Kamen Rider Kuuga, and now that he would portray Kamen Rider Gaim he hopes that he will inspire a new generation of boys. Rounding out the main cast are Yutaka Kobayashi as Kaito Kumon/Kamen Rider Baron, Mahiro Takasugi as Mitsuzane Kureshima/Kamen Rider Ryugen, Yuumi Shida from idol group Yumemiru Adolescence as the heroine Mai Takatsukasa, and Yuki Kubota as Takatora Kureshima/Kamen Rider Zangetsu.

970,64087312,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vobasine,Vobasine,"Vobasine is a naturally occurring monoterpene indole alkaloid found in several species in the genus Tabernaemontana including Tabernaemontana divaricata.

History
Vobasine was first reported by Renner in 1959 after its isolation from Voacanga africana. The two structurally related compounds, dregamine and tabernaemontanine, where its alkene (=CHCH3) sidechain was reduced to ethyl groups in two configurations, had their relationship confirmed in the 1970s. Vobasine has been found in many plants of the dogbane (Apocynaceae) family including Tabernaemontana dichotoma.

Synthesis

Biosynthesis

As with other Indole alkaloids, the biosynthesis of vobasine starts from the amino acid tryptophan. This is converted into strictosidine before further elaboration.

Chemical synthesis
The synthesis of alkaloids with the same carbon skeleton as vobasine began in the 1960s and has continued, with some work providing enantiospecific approaches to closely-related compounds.

Natural occurrence

Vobasine is found commonly in the genera Tabernaemontana and Voacanga, including the species Ervatamia hirta, Tabernaemontana elegans, Tabernaemontana divaricata and Voacanga africana.

Biochemistry  
Plant metabolites have been of interest for their possible biological activity and alkaloids in particular are major subjects for ethnobotanical research. Vobasine has been studied, for example as a potential anti-cancer agent and for its hypotensive activity. However, the alkaloid itself has not been developed as a drug.

Toxicity
Very high dose of vobasine at around 300mg/kg may cause death through CNS and respiratory depression.

974,182028,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave%20painting,Cave painting,"Cave paintings are a type of parietal art (which category also includes petroglyphs, or engravings), found on the wall or ceilings of caves. The term usually implies prehistoric origin, and the oldest known are more than 100,000 years old (art of the Upper Paleolithic), found in both the Haryana region Manghar bani north western India, and in the caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia). The oldest are often constructed from hand stencils and simple geometric shapes. However, more recently, in 2021, cave art of a pig found in an Indonesian island, and dated to over 45,500 years, has been reported.

A 2018 study claimed an age of 64,000 years for the oldest examples of non-figurative cave art in the Iberian Peninsula. Represented by three red non-figurative symbols found in the caves of Maltravieso, Ardales and La Pasiega, Spain, these predate the appearance of modern humans in Europe by at least 20,000 years and thus must have been made by Neanderthals rather than modern humans.

In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the then-oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo. In December 2019, however, figurative cave paintings depicting pig hunting in the Maros-Pangkep karst in Sulawesi were estimated to be even older, at least 43,900 years old. The finding was noted to be ""the oldest pictorial record of storytelling and the earliest figurative artwork in the world"".

Dating

Nearly 350 caves have now been discovered in France and Spain that contain art from prehistoric times. Initially, the age of the paintings had been a contentious issue, since methods like radiocarbon dating can produce misleading results if contaminated by other samples, and caves and rocky overhangs (where parietal art is found) are typically littered with debris from many time periods. But subsequent technology has made it possible to date the paintings by sampling the pigment itself, torch marks on the walls, or the formation of carbonate deposits on top of the paintings. The subject matter can also indicate chronology: for instance, the reindeer depicted in the Spanish cave of Cueva de las Monedas places the drawings in the last Ice Age.

The oldest known cave painting is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave, Cáceres, Spain. It has been dated using the uranium-thorium method to older than 64,000 years and was made by a Neanderthal. The oldest date given to an animal cave painting is now a depiction of several human figures hunting pigs in the caves in the Maros-Pangkep karst of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, dated to be over 43,900 years old. Before this, the oldest known figurative cave paintings were that of a bull dated to 40,000 years, at Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave, East Kalimantan, Borneo, and a depiction of a pig with a minimum age of 35,400 years at Timpuseng cave in Sulawesi.

The earliest known European figurative cave paintings are those of Chauvet Cave in France, dating to earlier than 30,000 BCin the Upper Paleolithic according to radiocarbon dating. Some researchers believe the drawings are too advanced for this era and question this age. However, more than 80 radiocarbon dates had been obtained by 2011, with samples taken from torch marks and from the paintings themselves, as well as from animal bones and charcoal found on the cave floor. The radiocarbon dates from these samples show that there were two periods of creation in Chauvet: 35,000 years ago and 30,000 years ago. One of the surprises was that many of the paintings were modified repeatedly over thousands of years, possibly explaining the confusion about finer paintings that seemed to date earlier than cruder ones. 

In 2009, cavers discovered drawings in Coliboaia Cave in Romania, stylistically comparable to those at Chauvet. An initial dating puts the age of an image in the same range as Chauvet: about 32,000 years old.

In Australia, cave paintings have been found on the Arnhem Land plateau showing megafauna which are thought to have been extinct for over 40,000 years, making this site another candidate for oldest known painting; however, the proposed age is dependent on the estimate of the extinction of the species seemingly depicted.  Another Australian site, Nawarla Gabarnmang, has charcoal drawings that have been radiocarbon-dated to 28,000 years, making it the oldest site in Australia and among the oldest in the world for which reliable date evidence has been obtained.

Other examples may date as late as the Early Bronze Age, but the well-known Magdalenian style seen at Lascaux in France (c.15,000 BC) and Altamira in Spain died out about 10,000BC, coinciding with the advent of the Neolithic period.  Some caves probably continued to be painted over a period of several thousands of years.

The next phase of surviving European prehistoric painting, the rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin, was very different, concentrating on large assemblies of smaller and much less detailed figures, with at least as many humans as animals.  This was created roughly between 10,000 and 5,500 years ago, and painted in rock shelters under cliffs or shallow caves, in contrast to the recesses of deep caves used in the earlier (and much colder) period.  Although individual figures are less naturalistic, they are grouped in coherent grouped compositions to a much greater degree. Over a long period of time, the cave art has become less naturalistic and has graduated from beautiful, naturalistic animal drawings to simple ones, and then to abstract shapes.

Subjects, themes, and patterns in cave painting 

Cave artists use a variety of techniques such as finger tracing, modeling in clay, engravings, bas-relief sculpture, hand stencils, and paintings done in two or three colors. Scholars classify cave art as ""Signs"" or abstract marks. 
  The most common subjects in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as bison, horses, aurochs, and deer, and tracings of human hands as well as abstract patterns, called finger flutings. The species found most often were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones; for example, the painters of Lascaux have mainly left reindeer bones, but this species does not appear at all in the cave paintings, where equine species are the most common.  Drawings of humans were rare and are usually schematic as opposed to the more detailed and naturalistic images of animal subjects. Kieran D. O'Hara, geologist, suggests in his book Cave Art and Climate Change that climate controlled the themes depicted.
Pigments used include red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide and charcoal. Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was incised in the rock first, and in some caves all or many of the images are only engraved in this fashion, taking them somewhat out of a strict definition of ""cave painting"".

Similarly, large animals are also the most common subjects in the many small carved and engraved bone or ivory (less often stone) pieces dating from the same periods.  But these include the group of Venus figurines, which have no real equivalent in cave paintings.

Hand stencils, formed by placing a hand against the wall and covering the surrounding area in pigment result in the characteristic image of a roughly round area of solid pigment with the uncoloured shape of the hand in the centre, these may then be decorated with dots, dashes, and patterns. Often, these are found in the same caves as other paintings, or may be the only form of painting in a location. Some walls contain many hand stencils.  Similar hands are also painted in the usual fashion. A number of hands show a finger wholly or partly missing, for which a number of explanations have been given. Hand images are found in similar forms in Europe, Eastern Asia and South America.

Theories and interpretations 

In the early 20th century, following the work of Walter Baldwin Spencer and Francis James Gillen, scholars such as Salomon Reinach, Henri Breuil and  interpreted the paintings as 'utilitarian' hunting magic to increase the abundance of prey. Jacob Bronowski states, ""I think that the power that we see expressed here for the first time is the power of anticipation: the forward-looking imagination. In these paintings the hunter was made familiar with dangers which he knew he had to face but to which he had not yet come.""

Another theory, developed by David Lewis-Williams and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, is that the paintings were made by paleolithic shamans. The shaman would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state, then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing out power from the cave walls themselves.

R. Dale Guthrie, who has studied both highly artistic and lower quality art and figurines, identifies a wide range of skill and age among the artists. He hypothesizes that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the representation of women in the Venus figurines) are the work of adolescent males, who constituted a large part of the human population at the time. However, in analyzing hand prints and stencils in French and Spanish caves, Dean Snow of Pennsylvania State University has proposed that a proportion of them, including those around the spotted horses in Pech Merle, were of female hands.

Other sites include Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England (~14,500 ys old cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), Peștera Coliboaia in Romania (~29,000 y.o. art?).

Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces; but fewer of those have survived because of erosion. One example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi (3000–2500 BC) in the Saimaa area of Finland.

When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Cave of Altamira in Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes. Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry and symbolism of Upper Palaeolithic peoples.

East and Southeast Asia 

In Indonesia the caves in the district of Maros in Sulawesi are famous for their hand prints. About 1,500 negative handprints have also been found in 30 painted caves in the Sangkulirang area of Kalimantan; preliminary dating analysis as of 2005 put their age in the range of 10,000 years old. A 2014 study based on uranium–thorium dating dated a Maros hand stencil to a minimum age of 39,900 years. A painting of a babirusa was dated to at least 35.4 ka, placing it among the oldest known figurative depictions worldwide.

In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo.

And more recently, in 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of cave art at least 45,500 years old in Leang Tedongnge cave, Indonesia. According to the journal Science Advances, the cave painting of a warty pig is the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region. It has been reported that it is rapidly deteriorating as a result of climate change in the region.

Originating in the Paleolithic period, the rock art found in Khoit Tsenkher Cave, Mongolia, includes symbols and animal forms painted from the walls up to the ceiling. Stags, buffalo, oxen, ibex, lions, Argali sheep, antelopes, camels, elephants, ostriches, and other animal pictorials are present, often forming a palimpsest of overlapping images. The paintings appear brown or red in color, and are stylistically similar to other Paleolithic rock art from around the world but are unlike any other examples in Mongolia.

The Padah-Lin Caves of Burma contain 11,000-year-old paintings and many rock tools.

India 

The Bhimbetka rock shelters exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India. Paintings in Bhimbetka are dated to about 8,000 BC. Similar paintings are found in other parts of India as well. In Tamil Nadu, ancient Paleolithic Cave paintings are found in Kombaikadu, Kilvalai, Settavarai and Nehanurpatti. In Odisha they are found in Yogimatha and Gudahandi. In Karnataka, these paintings are found in Hiregudda near Badami. The most recent painting, consisting of geometric figures, date to the medieval period.
Executed mainly in red and white with the occasional use of green and yellow, the paintings depict the lives and times of the people who lived in the caves, including scenes of childbirth, communal dancing and drinking, religious rites and burials, as well as indigenous animals.

Southern Africa
Cave paintings found at the Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia are estimated to date from approximately 25,500–27,500 years ago.

In 2011, archaeologists found a small rock fragment at Blombos Cave, about  east of Cape Town on the southern cape coastline in South Africa, among spear points and other excavated material. After extensive testing for seven years, it was revealed that the lines drawn on the rock were handmade and from an ochre crayon dating back 73,000 years. This makes it the oldest known rock painting.

Australia 

Significant early cave paintings, executed in ochre, have been found in Kimberley and Kakadu, Australia. Ochre is not an organic material, so carbon dating of these pictures is often impossible. The oldest so far dated at 17,300 years is an ochre painting of a kangaroo in the Kimberley region, which was dated by carbon dating wasp nest material underlying and overlying the painting.  Sometimes the approximate date, or at least, an epoch, can be surmised from the painting content, contextual artifacts, or organic material intentionally or inadvertently mixed with the inorganic ochre paint, including torch soot.

A red ochre painting, discovered at the centre of the Arnhem Land Plateau, depicts two emu-like birds with their necks outstretched. They have been identified by a palaeontologist as depicting the megafauna species Genyornis, giant birds thought to have become extinct more than 40,000 years ago; however, this evidence is inconclusive for dating.  It may suggest that Genyornis became extinct at a later date than previously determined.

Hook Island in the Whitsunday Islands is also home to a number of cave paintings created by the seafaring Ngaro people.

Holocene cave art

Asia
In the Philippines at Tabon Caves the oldest artwork may be a relief of a shark above the cave entrance. It was partially disfigured by a later jar burial scene.

The Edakkal Caves of Kerala, India, contain drawings that range over periods from the Neolithic as early as 5,000 BC to 1,000 BC.

Horn of Africa 

Rock art near Qohaito appears to indicate habitation in the area since the fifth millennium BC, while the town is known to have survived to the sixth century AD. Mount Emba Soira, Eritrea's highest mountain, lies near the site, as does a small successor village. Much of the rock art sites are found together with evidence of prehistoric stone tools, suggesting that the art could predate the widely presumed pastoralist and domestication events that occurred 5000– 4000 years ago.

In 2002, a French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel cave paintings on the outskirts of Hargeisa in Somaliland. Dating back around 5,000 years, the paintings depict both wild animals and decorated cows. They also feature herders, who are believed to be the creators of the rock art. In 2008, Somali archaeologists announced the discovery of other cave paintings in Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest includes one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is dated to 1000 to 3000 BC.

Additionally, between the towns of Las Khorey and El Ayo in Karinhegane is a site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals. Each painting has an inscription below it, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old. Karihegane's rock art is in the same distinctive style as the Laas Geel and Dhambalin cave paintings. Around 25 miles from Las Khorey is found Gelweita, another key rock art site.

In Djibouti, rock art of what appear to be antelopes and a giraffe are also found at Dorra and Balho.

North Africa 

Many cave paintings are found in the Tassili n'Ajjer mountains in southeast Algeria. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the rock art was first discovered in 1933 and has since yielded 15,000 engravings and drawings that keep a record of the various animal migrations, climatic shifts, and change in human inhabitation patterns in this part of the Sahara from 6000 BC to the late classical period. Other cave paintings are also found at the Akakus, Mesak Settafet and Tadrart in Libya and other Sahara regions including: Ayr mountains, Niger and Tibesti, Chad.

The Cave of Swimmers and the Cave of Beasts in southwest Egypt, near the border with Libya, in the mountainous Gilf Kebir region of the Sahara Desert. The Cave of Swimmers was discovered in October 1933 by the Hungarian explorer László Almásy. The site contains rock painting images of people swimming, which are estimated to have been created 10,000 years ago during the time of the most recent Ice Age.

In 2020, limestone cave decorated with scenes of animals such as donkeys, camels, deer, mule and mountain goats was uncovered in the area of Wadi Al-Zulma by the archaeological mission from the Tourism and Antiquities Ministry. Rock art cave is 15 meters deep and 20 meters high.

Southern Africa 

At uKhahlamba / Drakensberg Park, South Africa, now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the San people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs. Human figures are much more common in the rock art of Africa than in Europe.

North America 

Distinctive monochrome and polychrome cave paintings and murals exist in the mid-peninsula regions of southern Baja California and northern Baja California Sur, consisting of Pre-Columbian paintings of humans, land animals, sea creatures, and abstract designs. These paintings are mostly confined to the sierras of this region, but can also be found in outlying mesas and rock shelters. According to recent radiocarbon studies of the area, of materials recovered from archaeological deposits in the rock shelters and on materials in the paintings themselves, suggest that the Great Murals may have a time range extending as far back as 7,500 years ago.

Native artists in the Chumash tribes created cave paintings that are located in present-day Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties in Southern California in the United States. They include examples at Burro Flats Painted Cave and Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park.

There are also Native American pictogram examples in caves of the Southwestern United States.  Cave art that is 6,000 years old was found in the Cumberland Plateau region of Tennessee.

South America 

Serra da Capivara National Park is a national park in the north east of Brazil with many prehistoric paintings; the park was created to protect the prehistoric artifacts and paintings found there. It became a World Heritage Site in 1991. Its best known archaeological site is Pedra Furada.

It is located in northeast state of Piauí, between latitudes 8° 26' 50"" and 8° 54' 23"" south and longitudes 42° 19' 47"" and 42° 45' 51"" west. It falls within the municipal areas of São Raimundo Nonato, São João do Piauí, Coronel José Dias and Canto do Buriti. It has an area of 1291.4 square kilometres (319,000 acres). The area has the largest concentration of prehistoric small farms on the American continents. Scientific studies confirm that the Capivara mountain range was densely populated in prehistoric periods.

Cueva de las Manos (Spanish for ""Cave of the Hands"") is a cave located in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, 163 km (101 mi) south of the town of Perito Moreno, within the borders of the Francisco P. Moreno National Park, which includes many sites of archaeological and paleontological importance.

The hand images are often negative (stencilled). Besides these there are also depictions of human beings, guanacos, rheas, felines and other animals, as well as geometric shapes, zigzag patterns, representations of the sun, and hunting scenes. Similar paintings, though in smaller numbers, can be found in nearby caves. There are also red dots on the ceilings, probably made by submerging their hunting bolas in ink, and then throwing them up. The colours of the paintings vary from red (made from hematite) to white, black or yellow. The negative hand impressions date to around 550 BC, the positive impressions from 180 BC, while the hunting drawings are calculated to more than 10,000 years old.  Most of the hands are left hands, which suggests that painters held the spraying pipe with their right hand.

Southeast Asia 
There are rock paintings in caves in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Burma. In Thailand, caves and scarps along the Thai-Burmese border, in the Petchabun Range of Central Thailand, and overlooking the Mekong River in Nakorn Sawan Province, all contain galleries of rock paintings. In Malaysia, the Tambun rock art is dated at 2000 years, and those in the Painted Cave at Niah Caves National Park are 1200 years old. The anthropologist Ivor Hugh Norman Evans visited Malaysia in the early 1920s and found that some of the tribes (especially Negritos) were still producing cave paintings and had added depictions of modern objects including what are believed to be automobiles.

981,29207054,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Oruigbiji%20Pepple,George Oruigbiji Pepple,"George Oruigbiji Pepple, otherwise known as Perekule VII, (b. 1849 – d. 31 Oct 1888) ruled the Kingdom of Bonny, an independent trading state in the Niger Delta between 30 September 1866 and 14 December 1883, when he was deposed. After the British signed a treaty making the state a protectorate, he was restored on 22 January 1887, ruling until his death.

Background

The Kingdom of Bonny was a trading state founded before 1600, based on the port of Bonny in what is now Rivers State, Nigeria. It became a major trading center, first of slaves and later of palm oil products. During the 19th century, British influence was growing in the region.
George Oruigbiji Pepple was born in 1849, son of King William Dappa Pepple of Bonny, who was deposed by the British and deported to Britain in 1854. George went into exile with his father, and was educated in England at the boys' school at Hall Place, Bexley in southeast London. His studies included English, Greek, Mathematics, Scripture and History, the conventional syllabus of Victorian England.

During his father's exile, Bonny was torn by struggles, at times violent, between two rival factions attached to the ruling house.
The Manilla Pepple faction was led by Chief Oko Jumbo, but was racked by internal dissension.
It was opposed by the Anna or Annie Pepple faction, led by Chief Jubo Jubogha, known as Ja-Ja to the British.
In an attempt to restore peace, the British brought King William Dappa back and restored him to the throne in August 1861, reigning until his death in September 1866.

First reign

George Pepple became king in succession to his father on 30 September 1866, taking the regnal name of Perekule VII.
He was a Christian, and on his accession wrote to Bishop Crowther giving his support for introduction of the religion in Bonny. On 21 April 1867, supported by Oko Jumbo and other Manilla Pepple chiefs, he declared the iguana was no longer the sacred deity of the kingdom. His association with Christianity, at first welcomed by many people for the benefits it gave, gradually made him become identified with British interests and caused growing resentment.

The tension between the Manilla Pepple and Annie Pepple houses revived. 
In June 1867 there was a two-day skirmish between the factions, which King George managed to end by threatening to personally shoot the ringleaders.
In 1869 a major battle between the two factions led to Ja-Ja founding a new state of Opobo, further inland at the village of Andoni, taking some of the palm oil trade away from Bonny.
On 16 March 1870, George sailed for England, where he called for more forceful action by the British, a plea that was accepted. The British consul Livingston was supplied with a gunboat with which he sailed up the river to Andoni and imposed peace.

In 1879 George fell ill, and when he recovered took his doctor's advice to take a holiday in England. He was received well, his actions were reported in the press, and he was introduced to the Prince of Wales.
He was also presented with a steam launch at the end of his visit.
All this caused considerable alarm among the chiefs, concerned about his growing power, combined with the growing power of the British. He came close to being deposed on his return but was saved by the British consul.
On 14 December 1883 King George was deposed.

Restoration

In February 1886 a protectorate treaty was concluded between Bonny and Britain. A ruling council was established, and King George Pepple was restored to his throne. Oko Jumbo was publicly degraded, his bans on Christianity were repealed and afterwards he was a spent force in Bonny politics. King George died in October 1888, and was succeeded by a series of regents. He was buried in the British Cemetery of Funchal, Madeira. The cemetery today is administered and financed by the Anglican Holy Trinity Church, Rua Quebra Costa, Funchal, and has public access daily.

984,11035076,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29,Brigadier general (United States),"In the United States Armed Forces, a brigadier general is a one-star general officer in the United States Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force.

A brigadier general ranks above a colonel and below a major general.  The pay grade of brigadier general is O-7. 
It is equivalent to the rank of rear admiral (lower half) in the other United States uniformed services which use naval ranks.  It is abbreviated as BG in the Army, BGen in the Marine Corps, and Brig Gen in the Air Force and Space Force.

History

The rank of brigadier general has existed in the U.S. military since the inception of the Continental Army in June 1775. To prevent mistakes in recognizing officers, a general order was issued on July 14, 1775, establishing that brigadier generals would wear a ribbon, worn across the breast, between coat and waistcoat, pink in color. Later, on June 18, 1780, it was prescribed that brigadier generals would instead wear a single silver star on each epaulette. At first, brigadier generals were infantry officers who commanded a brigade; however, over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the responsibilities of the rank expanded significantly.

During the period from March 16, 1802, to January 11, 1812, the rank of major general was abolished and brigadier general became the highest rank in the U.S. Army. Foreseeing the need for an expanded general staff in case of war, which seemed imminent, Congress restored the rank of major general in January 1812.

The first brigadier general in the U.S. Marine Corps was Commandant Archibald Henderson, brevetted to the rank of brigadier general in the 1830s for his service in the Second Seminole War. The first non-brevet brigadier general in the Marines was Commandant Jacob Zeilin who was promoted to the rank in 1874, but when he retired in 1876, colonel once again became the highest rank in the Marines until March 1899 when Commandant Charles Heywood was promoted. Ever since then, the office of Commandant has been held by a general officer, with the permanent rank of the commandant raised to major general in 1908, and then to lieutenant general and subsequently to general during World War II, which rank it has held ever since.

The insignia for a brigadier general is one silver star worn on the shoulder or collar, and has not changed since the creation of the rank two centuries ago. Since the Mexican–American War, however, the lower rank of colonel has been the normal rank appointed to command a brigade that is organic to a division (e.g., the 1st Brigade of the 94th Infantry Division, vice the 187th Infantry Brigade). While separate brigades (e.g. the 187th, commanded by then-BG William Westmoreland in Korea) were traditionally commanded by brigadier generals, this practice has ceased in recent history.

Today, an Army or Marine Corps ""BG"" or ""BGen,"" respectively, typically serves as deputy commander to the commanding general of a division or division-sized units and assists in overseeing the planning and coordination of a mission. A Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), as the medium capability (and sized) scalable Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) with up to 20,000 Marines, is normally commanded by a Marine BGen. An Air Force brigadier general typically commands a large wing or serves as the deputy commander for a NAF. Additionally, one-star officers of all services may serve as high-level staff officers in large military organizations.

Statutory limits
U.S. law explicitly limits the total number of general officers who may be on active duty. The total number of active duty general officers is capped at 231 for the Army, 62 for the Marine Corps, and 198 for the Air Force. The President or Secretary of Defense may increase the number of slots for one branch, so long as they subtract an equal number from another. Some of these slots are reserved by statute.

Promotion, appointment and tour length
For promotion to the permanent grade of brigadier general, eligible officers are screened by a promotion board consisting of general officers from their branch of service. This promotion board then generates a list of officers it recommends for promotion to general rank. This list is then sent to the service secretary and the Joint Chiefs for review before it can be sent to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, for consideration. The President nominates officers to be promoted from this list with the advice of the Secretary of Defense, the service secretary, and if applicable, the service's chief of staff or commandant. The President may nominate any eligible officer who is not on the recommended list if it serves in the interest of the nation, but this is uncommon. The Senate must then confirm the nominee before the officer can be promoted. Once the nominee is confirmed, they are promoted to that rank once they assume or hold an office that requires or allows an officer of that rank. For positions of office reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For all three uniformed services, because the grade of brigadier general is a permanent rank, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board. The rank does not expire when the officer vacates a one-star position. Tour length varies depending on the position, by statute, or when the officer receives a new assignment. The average tour length of a one-star billet is two to four years.

Retirement
Other than voluntary retirement, statute sets a number of mandates for retirement. All brigadier generals must retire after five years in grade or 30 years of service, whichever is later, unless selected or appointed for promotion, or reappointed to grade to serve longer. Otherwise, all general and flag officers must retire the month after their 64th birthday. However, the Secretary of Defense can defer a general or flag officer's retirement until the officer's 66th birthday and the President can defer it until the officer's 68th birthday. Because there are a finite number of General officer positions, one officer must retire before another can be promoted. As a result, General and flag officers typically retire well in advance of the statutory age and service limits, so as not to impede the upward career mobility of their juniors.

987,16924299,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musalaha,Musalaha,"Musalaha (Hebrew: , ) is a non-profit organization that works towards reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians based on the Biblical principles of peace, justice, and love. The name Musalaha comes from the Arabic word for 'reconciliation'. The mission statement from their official website states: ""Musalaha is a non-profit organization that seeks to promote reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians as demonstrated in the life and teaching of Jesus. We seek to be an encouragement and facilitator of reconciliation, first among Palestinian Christians and Messianic Israelis, and then beyond to our respective communities.""
It also states that Musalaha seeks ""to facilitate bridge building among different segments of the Israeli and Palestinian societies according to biblical reconciliation principles."" 

Musalaha partners with a number of different organization around the world, such as Reconciliation Ministries in the United States, and Amzi in Germany and Switzerland, as well with local Palestinian and Israeli organizations. Musalaha's Board members are all Messianic Jewish Israeli and Palestinian Christian leaders in Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

History of Musalaha

Musalaha was founded in 1990, when unity among Israeli and Palestinian believers was especially lacking due to the First Intifada. Dr. Salim J. Munayer, an Israeli-Palestinian from Lod, relates how this lack of unity was recognized by leaders from both sides. In response they ""founded Musalaha as a vehicle to bring people into the process of Biblical reconciliation"". Their vision was to create a neutral space for Messianic Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Christians to meet with each other, and receive training in reconciliation. Musalaha began by taking groups of Palestinians and Israelis on trips to the desert, which thanks to its isolation, is an ideal location for this type of encounter. Munayer articulated this vision when he said, ""I would like to try taking groups of people from both sides out into the desert for three days. I believe that when they are away from their normal surroundings, in a situation where they must work together, we can begin to break down the barriers and build a trust relationship."" From its small, grass-roots beginning, Musalaha has grown into a thriving, locally and internationally recognized entity, and has developed a large variety of reconciliation-based activities. While not ignoring the divisive political and theological issues such as Theology of the Land, Justice, Israeli settlements, and Palestinian terrorist attacks, Musalaha seeks to bring both sides together and develop friendships, before undertaking the difficult task of discussing them. In the words of Salim J. Munayer,

""As we founded Musalaha we knew that we had to deal with those issues, but also understood that Musalaha had to find a safe forum where people could develop relationships, and then express, exchange, learn, and debate the issues that divide us. Many wanted to deal with the issues right away without understanding the importance of the process: that these issues will be dealt with in proper time and manner, in the context of developed relationships.""The strategy for developing these foundational relationships, according to Munayer, was to bring both sides together. ""I came to the conclusion that the theology of reconciliation was the best theology to deal with all these issues, and that more than anything else, the Jewish and Palestinian believers needed to be brought together, face to face. Anything less would not work, because of the dehumanization and demonization going on from both sides.""

Among the early supporters of Musalaha was Open Doors leader, Brother Andrew. He wrote of Musalaha, ""Of all the ministries in Israel, I found myself drawn most to this one. It seemed the most ambitious but also the riskiest. It wasn't an idea promoted by foreign missionaries but was birthed in the local Christian community. It didn't just talk about the problem between Palestinians and Jews. It brought the two sides together and provided a means for them to reconcile.""

The Work of Musalaha

Musalaha has developed a number of different projects, from desert encounters to conferences and training workshops, all designed to bring Israelis and Palestinians together. Officially, Musalaha as an organization has no political stance or agenda, however in the words of Salim J. Munayer, ""It would be naive to say that Musalaha doesn't have one [a political agenda], because here in Jerusalem we are all involved in politics, as much as breathing or eating. Everything we say and do has political implications...So we do have a political agenda. We want to see nations in the Middle East, and especially the Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, being reconciled by the gospel. What does that mean? Simply, it means to be reconciled to each other.""
In order to bring about this reconciliation, Musalaha's list of activities has expanded from desert encounters, to include a variety of other projects. The goal is to expose Israelis and Palestinians of all ages to the message of reconciliation, and to equip them with the tools needed to make this vision a reality.

Children
The process of reconciliation is long and hard, however the earlier it is undertaken, the easier it is to make real progress. For children, learning to understand the ""Other"" side comes quickly when they have exposure to each other.

Musalaha hosts an annual Children's Summer Camp. This camp is unique in that it brings together Israeli and Palestinian children (ages 9–12) in a friendly, neutral environment. For many of these young children, this camp is their first exposure to anyone from the other side and can be a very formative experience, and have a positive influence on their perceptions of each other.

Youth
Musalaha also focuses on developing the ethic of reconciliation among youth. They organize a Youth Desert Encounter once a year, for around 50 Israeli and Palestinian youth, where they receive training in reconciliation, and have a chance to build relationships with each other. It also involves other activities such as hiking and camel riding. The Youth Desert Encounter takes place locally, either in the Arabah or in the Negev regions of southern Israel.

Young adults
Another annual Musalaha event is Young Adult Desert Encounter, which takes place in Wadi Rum in Jordan. It is similar to the Youth Desert Encounter, however it usually involves discussion on a higher, more intense level as most of the participants are university students, and many on the Israeli side have already completed their mandatory military service. Musalaha views the young adults as an important demographic to reach, because they are the leaders of the future. The focus for this desert encounter remains reconciliation and relationship building.

Women
Musalaha has established a network of women's groups, that bring together Israeli and Palestinian women for fellowship, relationship-building, and reconciliation training. They have a number of annual conferences and seminars that focus on intensive reconciliation training. These women are also encouraged to undertake their own reconciliation activities, as well as humanitarian outreach projects. The focus on women stems from a recognition that they serve as agents of change in their communities, and have significant influence in their capacity as mothers and wives, as well as working members of both the Israeli and Palestinian societies.

Community leaders
The leaders of every community have a great amount of influence over others within their society. Musalaha actively seeks out these leaders, from Israeli and Palestinian communities, in order to train them in reconciliation. The assumption is that they will be effective in transforming the perspective of the people around them in a positive way. Numerous conferences and seminars are organized yearly for Community Leaders, and their families.

Publication
There are many articles and project reports available on the Musalaha website. Additionally, Musalaha has published a number of books:
In the Footsteps of our Father Abraham, Edited by Salim J. Munayer (Jerusalem: Art Plus, 1993) This book is a collection of articles by both Messianic Jewish and Palestinian Christian leaders, on the topic of reconciliation, from its Biblical foundations, to its practical application.

Musalaha's location
The Musalaha office is in southern Jerusalem, in the Talpiyot neighborhood. Participants in  Musalaha activities and events come from all over Israel, as well as from the Palestinian Territories. Their conferences and seminars take place at various locations around the country, however because it is often difficult to find a place where both Israelis and Palestinians are comfortable, and legally allowed to meet, Musalaha activities often take place in other regional locations such as Jordan, Cyprus, and in Europe.

Musalaha's supporters
As a non-profit, non-governmental organization, Musalaha depends on various charitable organizations worldwide that support its work.

992,48451342,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick%20Langford,Patrick Langford,"Patrick Wilson Langford  (4 November 1919 – 31 March 1944), was a Royal Canadian Air Force officer, the pilot instructor aboard a Vickers Wellington bomber, who was taken prisoner during the Second World War. He took part in the 'Great Escape' from Stalag Luft III in March 1944, but was one of the men recaptured and subsequently shot by the Gestapo.

Pre-war life 
Langford was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the son of Olive Mary and Captain Richard Wilson Langford an English couple. His father was Forest Ranger at the Jasper National Park and its first resident official and Chief Warden from 1911. He returned to England to serve in World War I and settled back in Canada at Jasper with his new wife in 1919 where they started their family. Patrick was their eldest son. He was educated at Jasper Public and High Schools from September 1926 to June 1936 and Banff High School from September 1936 to June 1937 and worked for Brewster Transport as a driver during the summers and also for six months on engineering surveys in the National Parks as a chainman and on instrument work.

War service 
On 29 January 1940 in Edmonton, Alberta Langford joined in the Royal Canadian Air Force as a Regular Service officer and was commissioned, he was assigned to Calgary Aero Club flying Gypsy Moth aircraft and then to No.1 Initial Training Squadron Toronto, serving at RCAF Camp Borden he was awarded his aircrew brevet pilot's flying badge on 19 August 1940. Langford was promoted flying officer and posted to Station Trenton on 5 October 1940.  He transferred to No.6 Service Flying Training School at Dunnville on 21 November 1940 serving there as a flying instructor to 7 April 1942 during which time he was promoted to temporary flight lieutenant on 9 August 1941.  Langford flew to England to begin operational flying and landed on 9 April 1942. He joined No. 16 Operational Training Unit RAF flying Wellington bombers on 19 May 1942.

Prisoner of war 
On the night of 28–29 July 1942 at 22:14 hours he took off in a Wellington Mark Ic bomber (serial number R1450) from RAF Upper Heyford to bomb the German shipbuilding and port city of Hamburg flying as Instructor with a student crew. The bomber was shot down over Lübeck in northern Germany by a Luftwaffe night fighter and crashed killing 3 of the crew, the pilot was taken prisoner unhurt but Langford and the rear gunner were taken prisoner seriously injured.
He had baled out with his parachute on fire and was badly burned and hospitalized for 2 months by the Germans during which time he was promoted to full flight lieutenant before being sent on 1 October 1942 to Stalag Luft III in the province of Lower Silesia near the town of Sagan (now Żagań in Poland).

'Great Escape' 
As prisoner No. 710 Langford was involved in the planning and excavation of the tunnel code-named ""Harry"" which was located under the barrack's stove in Room 23 of Block 104. He was also the ""trapfuehrer"" responsible to ensure that the red hot stove on its tiled piece of removable flooring was back in place over the tunnel whenever the guards were nearby. He mastered his technique to a point that he could close the trap door above the tunnellers cushioned with blankets to kill any hollow sound, and get the stove in place with carefully replaced dust and dirt within 20 seconds of a guard approaching. Langford saved the tunnel from discovery on several occasions. The tunnel was completed in early March 1944 measuring 106.07 m (348 ft) in length and the date for the break-out was set for 24 March. Approximately 600 airmen had worked on various aspects of the tunnel's construction. A list of 220 people was compiled for the actual escape but only 80 managed to get through the tunnel and of these, four were apprehended at the tunnel's exit.

He was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944 in the escape now famous as ""the Great Escape"". Having got clear of the camp Langford was in a party of officers who fought their way through the snow and bitter cold walking as fast as they could, they kept pushing onwards despite the weather and survived freezing nights outdoors only to be recaptured on 28 March 1944.  He was in the party with Ian Cross, Jack Grisman, Sandy Gunn and Tom Leigh held at Görlitz Civil Prison, where on the morning of 31 March 1944 Keith Ogilvie saw Edgar Humphreys, Dutchy Swain, Chaz Hall, Brian Evans, Wally Valenta, George McGill, Pat Langford, ""Adam"" Wlodzimierz Kolanowski, Bob Stewart and ""Hank"" Henry Birkland being led away to a covered truck, They were all shot in a clearing off the Görlitz to Sagan road just outside Görlitz and cremated at Liegnitz by the Gestapo.
Langford was one of the 50 escapers executed and murdered by the Gestapo. Originally his remains were buried at Sagan, he is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery. he is also commemorated by the Royal Canadian Air Force.

His name was amongst those in the list of the murdered prisoners which was published when news broke on or about 19–20 May 1944. and he is also mentioned in the ""Ottawa Citizen"" on 27 February 1946.

Awards 
Mentioned in Despatches for conspicuous gallantry as a prisoner of war (none of the other relevant decorations then available could be awarded posthumously). It was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 8 June 1944.

Other victims 
See Stalag Luft III murders

995,10491479,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%20Westley,Tom Westley,"Thomas Westley (born 13 March 1989) is an English professional cricketer who has played Test cricket for the England cricket team. He is a top order right-handed batsman who occasionally bowls offbreaks and has played first-class cricket for Essex County Cricket Club since 2006. He began his cricket career at Weston Colville Cricket Club in Cambridgeshire.

Early life and education
Westley was born on 13 March 1989 in Cambridge. He was educated at Coleridge Community College, Hills Road Sixth Form College and studied at Durham University.

County career
Westley's Essex career began in the 2004 Second XI Championship where he played his debut match as a 15-year-old against a Middlesex side captained by then 51-year-old ex-Test cricketer John Emburey. Westley continued to play occasionally throughout this and the next season, 2005 proving to be an excellent year for the young player as he proved his worth as a squad member. In the same year Westley played two matches in the Minor Counties Championship for Cambridgeshire.

2006 saw Westley make his first List A match appearance, against a team of Sri Lankans, as well as gaining a place in the first team for the 2007 season. In September 2009 Westley scored his first century for the first team reaching 132 against Derbyshire.

Westley has also played for MCC and captained the Durham MCC University side in games against county sides and against other university sides. When he is not needed by Essex, he plays in the East Anglian Premier Cricket League for Mildenhall Cricket Club, as well as playing for Radwinter Bowls Club.

International career
After playing for the England Under-19 cricket team, including at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Malaysia, Westley was added to England's Test squad ahead of the third Test against South Africa in July 2017 batting third as a replacement for the injured Gary Ballance. He made his Test debut at The Oval on 27 July 2017, scoring 25 runs in the first innings and 59 in the second, as England won by 239 runs.

Westley was again selected to bat third in the fourth Test and for all three of England's Test matches against the West Indies played in August and September 2017. A series of low scores meant that he dropped out of the side after the end of the 2017 English summer.

998,51556964,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude%20Blair,Claude Blair,"Claude Blair,  (30 November 1922 – 21 February 2010) was a British museum curator and scholar, who specialised in European arms and armour. He is particularly known for his book European Armour: circa 1066 to circa 1700 (1958). He worked in the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London from 1951 to 1956, before moving to the Department of Metalwork at the Victoria and Albert Museum, where he remained until his retirement as Keeper of Metalwork in 1982. He was active in church conservation, and served as a Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries of London from 1990 to 1993.

Early life and education
Blair was born on 30 November 1922 in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Lancashire, England. He was the only child born to William Henry Murray Blair (1875–1945), cotton-goods merchant, and Lilian Blair (née Wearing; 1891–1983). He was educated at William Hulme's Grammar School, a grammar school in Manchester.

Following military service in World War II, Blair matriculated into the University of Manchester in 1946. He studied history, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1950. He later studied for a Master of Arts (MA) degree from Manchester which he completed in 1963 with a thesis titled ""The Emperor Maximilian I's Gift of Armour to Henry VIII and the Silvered and Engraved Armour at the Tower of London"".

Career

Military service
Blair served in the British Army during World War II. Having undertaken officer training in 1942, he was commissioned into the Royal Regiment of Artillery as a second lieutenant on 24 April 1943. While serving in Northern Ireland, he was injured in a vehicle accident.  He was riding in the back of a truck that was picking up his regiment's beer supply when the truck braked sharply.  The beer barrels shifted; his leg was trapped between two of them and was broken. This ended his active service but he remained in the army as part of the team that tested new small arms. He left the Army in 1946 with the rank of captain.

Curatorial career
In 1951, Blair began his curatorial career, having been appointed an assistant to James Mann at the Tower of London Armouries in London. During his time at the Tower, he undertook research into its amour collection and published a book on the matter, European Armour, circa 1066 to circa 1700, which appeared in 1958. This book proved popular and has ""yet to be superseded as the standard text on the subject"".

In 1956, Blair moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) after being appointed Assistant Keeper of Metalwork by its director, Sir Trenchard Cox. He was promoted to Deputy Keeper in 1966 and to Keeper (i.e. head) of the Department of Metalwork in 1972. He retired from the V&A in 1982.

During his career, Blair published more than 200 books and articles. These were varied works, from those related to his main interest of armour, articles about monuments and even the Crown Jewels. He believed that ""museums should be powerhouses of scholarship, but should also communicate and educate"". As such, he would give lectures that were accessible to children during the Easter holidays, and wrote a number books aimed at the general public.

Later life
Blair led an active retirement. He was a member of the Churches Conservation Trust from 1982 to 1997, and a member of the Executive Committee of the Council for the Care of Churches from 1983 to 1991. He was Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries of London between 1990 and 1993.

Blair spent his final years living in Ashtead, Surrey. He died on 21 February 2010 at Epsom Hospital, Epsom, having suffered from heart failure.

Personal life
On 23 February 1952, Blair married Joan Mary Greville Drinkwater (1923–1996). Together they had one son, John Blair (born 1955); he is now an academic at Oxford University specialising in the history and archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England.

Honours
In the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, Blair was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) ""for services to Church Conservation"". In the 2005 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) ""for services to the Royal Collection"".

In 1956, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). In 1986, he was awarded the Medal of the Arms and Armour Society. In 1995, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Society of Antiquaries; this is awarded ""for distinguished services to archaeology"" and is the Society's highest award.
