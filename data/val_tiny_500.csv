2,25,8605,"Obama’s Kill Policy

Below is today’s column in Foreign Policy magazine on Attorney General Eric Holder’s speech at Northwestern University Law School. UPDATE: FBI Director declines to answer whether the new doctrine allows the killing of citizens in the United States.

On Monday, March 5, Northwestern University School of Law was the location of an extraordinary scene for a free nation. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder presented President Barack Obama’s claim that he has the authority to kill any U.S. citizen he considers a threat. It served as a retroactive justification for the slaying of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki last September by a drone strike in northeastern Yemen, as well as the targeted killings of at least two other Americans during Obama’s term.

What’s even more extraordinary is that this claim, which would be viewed by the Framers of the U.S. Constitution as the very definition of authoritarian power, was met not with outcry but muted applause. Where due process once resided, Holder offered only an assurance that the president would kill citizens with care. While that certainly relieved any concern that Obama would hunt citizens for sport, Holder offered no assurances on how this power would be used in the future beyond the now all-too-familiar “trust us” approach to civil liberties of this administration.

In his speech, Holder was clear and unambiguous on only one point: “The president may use force abroad against a senior operational leader of a foreign terrorist organization with which the United States is at war — even if that individual happens to be a U.S. citizen.” The use of the word “abroad” is interesting because senior administration officials have previously suggested that the president may kill an American anywhere and anytime, including within the United States. Holder’s speech does not materially limit that claimed authority, but stressed that “our legal authority is not limited to the battlefields in Afghanistan"
3,4,27170,"Israel has been on an Olympic roll lately, with teams picking up medals in several of the hardest “sports” around — mathematics, computer science, and physics. Israeli high school students participated in the annual international Olympiads, winning top honors for solving complicated problems in each of the disciplines.

Students who participated in the event came from various parts of the country, and from both the religious and secular school systems. But at least one policy group is concerned that looming budget cuts in the education system could harm the chances of Israeli students’ excelling in future events.

The three contests in which Israelis shone this summer — the International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Physics Olympiad, and International Olympiad in Informatics — are part of the five international contests in the hard sciences developed by UNESCO for high school students. Israelis did not score a medal in this year’s Chemistry Olympiad, and did not send a team to the Biology Olympiad.

In its latest triumph, Israel’s student team won six medals: one gold, three silver and two bronze at the International Mathematical Olympiad. Started in 1959, the math Olympiad is the oldest of the five international science events. Teams are faced with problems in some of the most difficult areas of math (not usually covered in high school) such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations and number theory.

Overall, the Israeli team was ranked 13th among 97 participating countries at this year’s event in Santa Marta, Colombia, this past weekend. That was a distinct improvement over last year’s performance in Argentina, when the Israeli team was ranked 31st, winning three silvers and one bronze, along with an honorary mention.

6,21,24889,"Kings Mall

Kings Mall is a retail, residential and office complex in Hammersmith in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The development is situated off King Street.

The complex consists of Kings Mall Shopping Centre, Kings Mall Car Park, Ashcroft Square and Sovereign Court housing estates, and the One Lyric Square office building.

History
The complex was designed by Richard Seifert and developed by St Martins Property Group. Residential apartments situated above the mall were constructed in 1973, whilst the shopping centre itself opened in 1980. The development originally came with a 950-space car park. It also included two office buildings constructed in the mid 1970s.

The five acre site is split into two parts. The southern part, containing the main shopping centre, the original housing estate above it and one of the office buildings, is situated off King Street, to the south of the Hammersmith & City line railway line, and located between Lyric Square to the east and Leamore Street to the west. The northern part, originally containing the car park and other office building, is located to the north of the Hammersmith & City line railway line off Glenthorne Road, with Beadon Road to the east and Leamore Street to the west. The northern and southern parts of the complex are linked via a covered footbridge over the Hammersmith & City line railway line at the first floor level of the shopping centre. The only other amenities at the first floor level are public toilets and access to the original housing estate.

In 2011, the owner of Kings Mall, St Martins Property Group sold it to Matterhorn Capital for £115 million.

In June 2015, Matterhorn Capital sold the shopping centre on to its current owner Schroders for £153 million.

In 2016, the car park and one of the office buildings were demolished and replaced with a smaller 753-space car park with new residential apartments situated above it.

As of 2019, the centre is currently undergoing a multimillion-pound transformation. This includes removing the external staircases to the flats above outside each of the entrances to the shopping centre off King Street, and a complete internal refurbishment of the shopping arcade.

In January 2020, Swedish furniture conglomerate Ikea purchased the centre

Retail units
Kings Mall Shopping Centre as of 2019 currently has  of retail space which houses around 44 retail units split into two areas: most units are off a single level shopping arcade perpendicular and parallel to King Street, whilst the remaining units directly front onto and are accessed via King Street itself.

Current tenants
There are five anchor stores, including a branch of Primark in Unit 1. Units 2-3 are occupied by Sainsbury's (who relocated from a smaller Sainsbury's Central branch opposite the east entrance of Kings Mall in 2005). The other anchor stores are WHSmith (the only original tenant left and whose shop"

Consistently, we found that the baseline heart mass index was not different between mice with global deletion of *Trpc6* and control wild-type littermates ([Fig. 3a](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}). Deletion of *Trpc6* partially protected against ISO-induced cardiac remodeling, but completely prevented the exaggerated ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy in Klotho-deficient mice. Consistent with these results, deletion of *Trpc6* attenuated ISO-induced increases in *ANP* and *BNP* mRNA, and abolished the exaggerated ISO-induced increases in the mRNA in Klotho-deficient mice ([Fig. 3b, c](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}).

We further investigated cardioprotection by Klotho using transgenic mice that overexpress TRPC6 in hearts. Mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of TRPC6 develop spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy and also have heightened sensitivity to stress-induced hypertrophy^[@R16]^. We crossed mice with cardiac TRPC6 overexpression with transgenic mice overexpressing Klotho to create double transgenic mice, and compared the survival rate, heart mass index, and cardiac fetal gene expression of double transgenic mice with those of having cardiac overexpression of TRPC6 and with wild-type littermates. Compared to wild-type littermates at 24 months of age, cardiac TRPC6-overexpressing mice had decreased survival and increased heart mass index and cardiac fetal gene expression without ISO treatment ([Fig. 3d--f](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}). Klotho overexpression tended to improve the survival of cardiac TRPC6-overexpressing mice, prevented the increase in heart mass, and markedly diminished the increase in fetal gene expression induced by overexpression of TRPC6 in hearts. These studies also support the notion that Klotho protects the heart by inhibiting cardiac TRPC6.

Soluble Klotho inhibits TRPC6 in isolated cardiac myocytes {#S6}
----------------------------------------------------------

Klotho is not expressed in the heart. We tested the hypothesis that soluble Klotho present in the systemic circulation mediates the inhibition of cardiac TRPC6. TRPC6 is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG)^[@R15]^. We examined TRPC6 channel activity in freshly isolated ventricular myocytes by whole-cell patch-clamp recording using stimulation by endothelin-1 (ET1) to release DAG ([Fig. 4a](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}). Ventricular myocytes from wild-type mice without ISO treatment showed baseline endothelin-1-activated TRPC-like currents presumably mediated by non-TRPC6 channels, as currents were not different between *Trpc6*-knockout mice (C6^−/−^) and wild-type littermates ([Fig. 4b](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}). ISO treatment increased TRPC6-mediated currents in wild-type hearts ([Fig. 4a, b](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}); the role of TRPC6 is supported by the facts that the increase was eliminated in *Trpc6*-knockout mice ([Fig. 4b](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}), and identical currents were seen in TR"

9,26,1142,"Mercedes-Benz Ponton

The Mercedes-Benz ""Ponton"" series are a range of sedans / saloon car models from Daimler-Benz, introduced starting in 1953, and nicknamed 'Ponton' (the German word for ""pontoon""), referring to the visually distinct fenderline running back from the headlights down the length of the car, looking visually like pontoons on a seaplane, a postwar car design innovation also generally known as ponton styling (as distinct from older models with the hood, body, fenders and running boards all appearing as unique units, and from newer models without visually distinct fenders at all). This slab-sided appearance, along with the 3-box coachwork were considered the height of modern design in the 1950s  More profound than the visual changes, the Ponton models' construction introduced innovations that fundamentally improved automotive safety for passengers through better crash protection. Mercedes-Benz stretched the 'Ponton' saloons into a range that became the automaker's bulk production models until 1959, and the base Ponton is generally considered as the beginning of the lineage of the Mercedes E-class range.

The 1953 Mercedes-Benz W120, marketed as 180, four-cylinder sedans were Mercedes' second totally new series of passenger cars since World War II, following the 1951 introduction of the top of the range W186 Type 300 “Adenauer”, and replaced the pre-war-designed Type 170 and Type 170 S. Contrasting very visibly with the traditional distinct fenders on that body-on-frame model and the ones before it, the 'Pontons' were Mercedes' first monocoque, unitary body production models.

Mercedes expanded the base Ponton model into a diversified line-up, developing multiple series based on the 180, by introducing more engines and stretching the body. Six-cylinder models received a longer nose, and 'S'-models also a longer passenger compartment, offering more legroom. A six-cylinder coupe and convertible were further derived, and a shortened floorpan of the four-cylinder sedan was also modified to serve as the structure for the Mercedes-Benz 190 SL roadster.

The 'Ponton' saloons were the automaker's main production models until 1959, adding up to 80% of Mercedes-Benz car production between 1953 and 1959, with some models lasting until 1962. The range was succeeded by the range of ""Heckflosse"" or ""Fintail"" models. The base Pontons and their successors, through to the E-class range, also became an almost default make and model of taxi cabs in Germany and surrounding countries, in the second half of the 20th century.

Design history 
Daimler-Benz emerged from World War II as a carmaker best known in the early 1950s for its expensive Mercedes-Benz 300 Adenauers and  exclusive Mercedes-Benz 300 S sports tourers. Both were largely handbuilt body on frame vehicles. Its low end was anchored by the dated pre-war designed Type 170. 

Seeking to expand its production boldly, Mercedes turned toward the unibody concept to design a line of mass-produced cars that would be rugged, reliable, and cost-effective to build in large numbers. Work began in earnest on the pontons bodied cars in 1951, with a design focused on passenger comfort and safety.  Head of the design team was Dr. Fritz Nallinger. Styling was headed by Karl Wilfert. Also in the design team was Béla"

2.

To determine the number of weeks for each segment, divide the 40 weeks of gestation by the number of groups your class has formed. Give the segments consecutive numbers (Segment 1, Segment 2, and so on), and assign each group one segment.

3.

Ask each group to use the research materials you have provided plus source materials from the library and the Internet to research the changes that both mother and fetus undergo during the gestation period the group has been assigned. (For example, students will find that by the end of the 12th week of gestation, the fetus has developed all of its organs and major body structures. They will find that during the final three months of pregnancy, a woman's growing uterus takes up a huge space; her spine curves with the extra weight; her abdominal organs and lungs are pushed out of place; and her heart works harder and grows larger.)

4.

When each group's research is complete, have students create a verbal description and a visual presentation showing the group's findings and detailing the changes that occur in both fetus and mother during the group's gestation period. Encourage students to include sonogram images if they are available.

When students' work is complete, compile the presentations into an illustrated time line of fetal development, and have each group present its findings to the class.

3.

Cloning is the process by which a new individual is ""created"" from the genetic material of a single person, rather than getting half of its genetic material from one parent and half from the other. This creates an exact genetic copy of the gene donor. Though scientists do not think that cloning will be possible for humans for a very long time, some day it may become a reproductive option. Should cloning be viewed as just another tool that can allow infertile couples to have children? Under what circumstances might human cloning be acceptable?

4.

Tests have shown that by mid-pregnancy a fetus has developed all five senses. By the time a baby is born its brain has developed enough to process some of the information it receives through those five senses. Despite these facts, however, adult humans find it impossible to remember their first few months alive outside the womb, let alone the nine months they spent inside it. Speculate about the reasons for this huge memory gap.

5.

A mother delivers nutrients and oxygen to the fetus through the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord may also deliver such substances as medication, toxins, drugs, and alcohol, however. Debate whether expectant mothers should be subject to laws that protect the health of the fetus. Should pregnant women be barred from holding potentially dangerous jobs?

6.

Human babies are born completely helpless. They must be fed and cared for by their parents for years before they could possibly survive on their own. Many other animals are born helpless, but remain so for a much shorter period of time. Still others can live nearly independently from the moment they are born. Speculate about the reasons behind these differences. What evolutionary advantages and disadvantages does a longer childhood offer the human species?

Reproductive Technology Debate
Recent advancements in modern medical technology have enabled many infertile couples to conceive and bear children. One side effect of some of these medical advancements, however, is multiple births, or two or more children born at a time, when the couple wanted only one baby. The world recently witnessed the birth of two sets of surviving sextuplets, for example, as well as one set of octuplets in which one of the eight babies died.

I second the view of @juergend that this should really be done in the presentation layer (although often it probably requires no less code overall to do it there than in SQL - but it does frustrate the workings of anything other than a static report, like datagrids that allow re-sorting or filtering)
I've knocked together some untested code (using Oracle syntax) which shows an example of how it's done - how we prepare the base data, then build a table of placeholders for all necessary rows, then join the base data onto the placeholders in the appropriate places. I've made some of the calculations a bit more elaborate to show where the number 5 constant is being used.
Also, I haven't included any code to knock off any"
15,10,15896,"Paxful sees huge crypto demand in developing markets

While cryptocurrencies are on the rise, their susceptibility to speculative activities and resulting price volatility have reduced their appeal to investors, particularly in the United States, Europe and China.

However, some crypto startups believe that emerging markets, where huge portions of the population are unbanked and unconnected, offer a more fertile ground for their growth.

In an interview with EJ Insight, Paxful founders Ray Youssef and Artur Schaback showed how the peer-to-peer crypto trading platform is accelerating its growth in Africa.

Established in 2015, Paxful enables users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with each other using more than 300 payment methods, such as multiple currencies, online payments, gift cards, etc. Known as one of the world’s largest peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplaces, Paxful has more than 2 million users globally and a weekly trading volume of US$20 million.

Investor sentiment toward cryptocurrencies dropped significantly after their prices plunged in early 2018. However, trading demand for Bitcoin in Africa has remained robust, Paxful chief executive Ray Youssef said.

“Paxful is seeing significant growth"

In an unprecedented response to Turkey’s derogation of the convention, 19 UN experts and three UN working groups issued a joint statement reminding the Turkish government that “The derogation provision under Article 4 does not give a carte blanche to ignore all obligations under the ICCPR,” and furthermore “The invocation of Article 4 is lawful only if there is a threat to the life of the nation, a condition that arguably is not met in this case.”

Other applicable international law stipulates numerous safeguards to protect detainees from torture and ill-treatment and to guarantee the fairness of any eventual trial. These include, among others, prompt judicial review of the legality of the detention, prompt access to a lawyer, and the possibility to confidentially communicate with legal counsel.

Torture in Turkey

Widespread and systematic torture has been a long-standing problem in Turkey’s recent past. The European Court of Human Rights has found that Turkey violated the prohibition on torture, inhuman and degrading treatment"

22,7,22559,"Questions and Answers about Past Life Regression Therapy

If you have never experienced a past life regression, you have questions about what to expect.

The links on this page are here to help you decide if past life regression therapy with Carol Bowman is for you. Some go deeper into the question of what past life regression therapy is, and how it works. The FAQ, below begins with more practical questions.

Past Life Regression FAQ

Over the more than twenty-five years I've been conducting past life regressions, I've fielded every question imaginable from prospective clients. The questions I hear most often I've answered here in this FAQ. If after reading this you have further questions, please call me between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. EST. If I'm not available, leave a message and I will call you back as soon as I can. My number is 610- 566- 3870

Q. Is a past life regression the same as a psychic reading?

No. A past life regression is much different than a psychic reading. I do not sit with you and tell you about your past lives, either over the phone or in person.

Instead, we meet in my office and I guide you to remember your own past life memories. I assist you in processing the memories and relating them to your present life. For you it is an active, not a passive, process. You participate fully in the regression as I guide you through it.

The goal is for you to gain direct experience of yourself as a soul journeying and growing through time towards healing.

Q. How long is a session?

A session is three hours. During the first hour we engage in an interview, which has the feel of a traditional counseling session. We discuss why you want to do a regression and what you would like to accomplish. I ask many questions about your present life including your family history, events in early childhood (if you remember), your physical health, etc., as a means of focusing on particular patterns that may be a reflection of your past life experiences. The interview not only gives me information about you, it also primes your unconscious and begins the regression process.

After the first hour, we move on to the regression. The regression is done while reclining with your eyes closed so you can direct all"

24,3,6995,"On brainy pop trio Jukebox the Ghost’s current tour—which arrives at Irving Plaza on Saturday, February 28—Jesse Kristin has been getting to enjoy his very own regular “Beth” moment. For those readers whose classic-rock knowledge may be deficient, I’m referring to what used to happen at Kiss concerts when Peter Criss (and later Eric Singer) would leave his seat behind the drums and sing “Beth,” the sensitive ballad that also happened to be the biggest hit those grease-painted rockers ever had.

One of the standout tracks on Jukebox the Ghost’s 2014 self-titled album, the incisive and more than a little Randy Newman-ish “Hollywood,” is sung by Kristin, the band’s drummer. Now, when that song comes around, in a break from past group protocol, he gets out in front of his kit to take the center stage microphone. And as was the case with Kiss, audiences … well … lick it up.

“That’s a highlight every night,” singer/keyboardist Ben Thornewill says. “There’s a big clap-along, and it’s just this explosion of energy that happens in the middle of the set, which sets the rest of the songs on fire. It’s like, ‘Oh, this isn’t supposed to happen. What’s going on? Are you messing with my mind?’ ”

Here’s another way the Jukebox men like to mess with listeners’ minds: By writing and recording songs that seem almost annoyingly perky at first but on closer examination show a much darker hue. “That’s part of our natural writing style,” Thornewill says. “We shy away from anything that’s too brazenly happy. We want to do something that’s fun but can also be rewarding on multiple listens.”

Achieving this multi-layered effect on Jukebox the Ghost (the band’s fourth album) was a lengthy process, which involved deconstructing and then reconstructing dozens of songs."

27,4,16390,"A report claims Melbourne has a lot more on the line than the future of big-bopper Sam Kasiano on the line in its salary cap crunch for round one.

The Daily Telegraph revealed recently the Storm have been shopping the prop around to rival clubs in a bid to squeeze under the 2019 salary cap.

The Storm’s full cap crisis was laid bare on Tuesday morning by Triple M NRL commentator Ben Dobbin, who told Triple M’s Big Breakfast that the club is $600,000 over the 2019 cap.

He reported the club is desperate to find a new home for Kasiano because the NRL recently threatened the club with being excluded from the opening round of the season on March 14 if they are still not salary cap compliant.

The NRL’s other tool for dealing with clubs who are over the cap heading into the start of a season would see the Storm lose captain Cameron Smith, who was the last player to sign on with the Storm for the 2019 season.

Melbourne’s salary cap crunch comes with the Sharks reportedly set to face a salary cap reduction of up to $500,000 for their salary cap scandal which reportedly dates back to cap breaches in 2015.

The Wests Tigers are also reportedly set to learn their fate surrounding a preliminary salary cap reduction of $640,000 surrounding an ambassadorial deal with club great Robbie Farah.

The clubs will learn their fate following Thursday’s Australian Rugby League commission meeting.

The news is concerning for the Storm, according to Dobbin.

“My mail is the Melbourne Storm are at least $600,000 over the salary cap right now,’ he said.

“He (Kasiano) has been shopped around to other clubs for some time. The NRL have said to the Melbourne Storm, ‘It’s like this. You can get under the salary cap within 16 days or you won’t be taking the field in round one’.

“Somebody has to go for the Melbourne Storm. If they can’t get rid of Sam Kasiano, there was a bit of talk if the findings come down with the NRL and St George put Jack de Belin to the sideline, St George would be able to pick up Kasiano. Kasiano is no Jack de Belin, nowhere near it.

He said the NRL’s “last man” in policy would cost the Storm Smith if the NRL is forced to take action to get the Storm compliant for 2019.

“The rule around the salary cap is if you can’t get under your salary cap, the last player signed is the one who has to go,” he said.

“So for example at the Cronulla Sharks, Shaun Johnson, star halfback, would be the one who has to go. Cronulla are going to be handed down fines on Friday for salary cap breaches. They need to shed a lot of people — like second stringers — and if they can’t, guess what, Shaun Johnson is gone.”

HAYNE BRUSHED BY CLUB RUGBY

Jarryd Hayne’s uncertain future remains in limbo after the Australian Rugby Union on Monday shot down the possibility of the former NFL star joining the 15-man code this season.

Hayne attended one of Eastwood Rugby Club’s training sessions in Sydney recently.

Currently without an NRL contract and fighting sexual assault charges both in Australia and the US, Hayne set tongues wagging when he was seen running around with the ‘Woodies’.

The Daily Telegraph spoke with the club’s head coach Ben Batger, who denied the six-time Shute Shield premiers were looking at signing the 30-year-old.

“Jarryd’s mates with one of the boys, he just came and did some training with us,” Batger said.

29,15,5943,"There are many reasons why you may be unhappy at this part of your life. A relationship alludes you or ends, the clock is ticking if you are a woman who wants to have children, you are bored with your job or it seems to be going nowhere, you have a dream, but cannot make it happen. Something is in the way, not right.

For some individuals, we know that something is very wrong – and we are depressed or unhappy. There can be conflict or even violence in relationships. Certain people or events at work really get to us – but it isn’t clear how to deal with it.

Individual therapy is the most direct, the exploration is of your feelings and life experiences in the safe environment with me. We are in charge of our feelings and the decisions we make in the process of creating our lives. The process of exploration is therefor one of discovery and clarity.

Connecting with your feelings takes you to what is happening now. But often you have felt this way before – earlier in your life. Or you know you have residual pain and anger from childhood trauma or abandonment. Reconnecting with these feelings is a way to get your thoughts and feelings to align, become congruent.

Authenticity

We are our most authentic self when our thoughts and feelings are aligned, centered in ourselves, grounded. Others call it, feeling comfortable in our own skin.

When we also have language to express ourselves from that centered space, we have our voice and can act. We are empowered from that place.

It is not easy to be in our authentic space in a noisy world, crowded with action, moving at a fast space.

Authenticity requires awareness and reflection – what am I feeling, what does it mean in my life, what is my purpose, the meaning of my life.

Young children sometimes say very authentic, insightful things – but they do not yet have the cognitive ability and language to make things happen from that space. But their experiences and feelings are valid and authentic.

A part of ourselves is often trapped in those feelings experienced in childhood. Sometimes we are able to connect with them through reflection – but most powerful is having someone to listen – to accept, respect, value and not to judge, question or criticize.

Telling Our Story

The way we connect with another or others is by telling our story – both the facts and our feelings about how we have experienced our lives. If there have been painful or confusing things about our lives, we sometimes don’t really know either the facts – or the feelings.

When children experience very traumatic events in their families, the feelings are often buried, no longer available to them. Yet they come out under conditions that create problems for oneself, at school or the work environment, in relationships.

When parents fight, children know something is wrong and are frightened. But if parents tell their children they are divorcing – without anything being obviously wrong – it is very confusing for children, a loss of trust in their own ability to know when something is wrong. In families with conflict, children, or some children in the family, become the object of parents’ anger and that child is abused, physically and emotionally. It becomes very hard for the other children. If they love that brother or sister, they are very upset when that child is targeted. But they are also grateful it is not happening to them – and pull away.

All of these experiences affect that person as an adult, carried over into dysfunctional relationships as well.

As we share our story and hear the story of another, we to begin to “know” each other. Trusting to share and receiving sharing create intimacy – the things we don’t share in ordinary life begin to weave a fabric of connection between us that takes us beyond the chemistry of attraction into a relationship.

When you come for therapy, you come because something is not working in your life the way you want it to. As you share your story with me, exploring together, you will discover new things about yourself. You are also laying a foundation for a relationship with others in your life outside of and beyond"

UWP Printing Long Datagrid that need to extend to multiple pages

I am making an accounting program using ( uwp, c#, MySQL ), I want to know when printing the reports if the datagrid is long how to extend the rest to new pages so that all report will be printed on multiple pages.
i used printhelp.cs that is in the printing sample: https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Printing, but it printed the datagrid only on one page and didn't extend the rest to more pages.
UWP XAML:

i expect when printing if the Datagrid is long to extend to next page. but it only prints the first page and does not extend the rest to new pages.

You could use the Print Helper class to print the DataGrid, but you still need to manually paging your data in code-behind.

""More Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,"" Trump tweeted. ""She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American.""

""Now Cherokee Nation denies her,"" he added. ""'DNA test is useless.' Even they don't want her. Phony!""

In a second tweet, Trump said Warren's ""claims of being of Indian heritage turned out to be a scam and a lie"" and demanded she ""apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public."" In a third tweet, he thanked the Cherokee Nation for ""revealing that Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is a complete and total Fraud!""

Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, “DNA test is useless.” Even they don’t want her. Phony! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018

Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public. Harvard called her “a person of color” (amazing con), and would not have taken her otherwise! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018

Thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is a complete and total Fraud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018

Shortly after, Warren fired back at Trump, accusing the president of ""racist name-calling.""

Millions of people watched you, @realDonaldTrump, as you fumbled and lied on your $1 million pledge. It then took a day for your handlers to tee up this recycled racist name-calling. You’ve lost a step, and in 21 days, you’re going to lose Congress. — Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 16, 2018

Trump’s tweets were in reference to fallout that came after Warren — who has faced repeated ridicule from the president for claiming that she is of Native American heritage — released a DNA test on Monday that says there is ""strong evidence"" to back up her claim.

The test, conducted by Stanford University professor Carlos Bustamante, a genetics and genomics expert, concludes that there is ""strong evidence"" that Warren's ""DNA sample of primarily European descent also contains Native American ancestry from an ancestor in the sample's pedigree 6-10 generations ago,"" according to the test's executive summary.

But the Cherokee Nation rejected Warren’s release of her test in a scathing statement.

""A DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship. Current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person’s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America,"" Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said.

""Sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship, and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage, such as paternity to an individual, it is not evidence for tribal affiliation. Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven.""

""Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage,"" he added.

I won't sit quietly for @realDonaldTrump's racism, so I took a test. But DNA & family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship, which is determined only – only – by Tribal Nations. I respect the distinction, & don't list myself as Native in the Senate. — Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 15, 2018

""Parece Chávez no começo do governo. Ele insultava a imprensa, ria dos jornais e criticava repórteres publicamente"", disse ao UOL, em São Paulo, ontem.

Ela mesma, que fez carreira na TV Globovisión e atualmente é correspondente em Caracas da TV e Rádio Caracol, da Colômbia, afirma ter sido alvo da ira dos regimes de Chávez e Maduro por conta da profissão.

""Em janeiro, achei que ia morrer apanhando de guardas do Serviço Bolivariano de Inteligência Nacional (Sebin)"", relata.

Ela afirma que se preparava para cobrir a prisão de Juan Guaidó, antes de ele ter se declarado presidente interino da Venezuela, quando foi levada por guardas bolivarianos.

A voz firme e impostada de Beatriz, treinada há anos no rádio e na TV, treme ao recontar as horas que passou em um porão, sem comunicação com a família ou advogados.

""Me arrastaram pelos cabelos, me obrigaram a dar a senha do meu celular e me trancaram com outra jornalista. Consegui avisar à rádio quando estava sendo presa, e o áudio foi ao ar ao vivo. Se não fosse isso, não sei o que teria acontecido comigo"", afirma.

No Brasil para participar hoje e amanhã do Festival Piauí de Jornalismo, cujo tema neste ano é ""Quando a imprensa se torna o adversário"", Beatriz evita se aprofundar nas comparações com a situação política daqui, mas acredita que seu relato pode ser útil para a reflexão.

""Quem atira pedras na imprensa ou aplaude os ataques hoje pode se arrepender amanhã"", afirma.

Beatriz - Estava com uma colega da CNN em outra pauta e ouvimos rumores de que Guaidó tinha sido preso. Fomos correndo para a frente do Sebin, para onde imaginamos que ele seria levado, estacionamos e ligamos para nossos chefes. Estávamos pedindo que mandassem câmeras, furgão para transmissão ao vivo, era um grande momento. Vimos uns homens de uniforme atravessando a rua e até imaginei que estivessem escoltando o Guaidó. Mas vieram em nossa direção, nos obrigaram a sair do carro e perguntaram o que estávamos fazendo ali. Falei que éramos jornalistas, daí tudo começou...

Despite having two accounts in the Top 20 of the Korean solo queue ladder, xiaohu’s form in competitive games has been dubious. He’s made simple mistakes in trading and map positioning in the side lanes, getting caught repeatedly by EDward Gaming’s global compositions. Lissandra and Syndra, both known as strong champions for xiaohu, didn’t have the same impact as they’ve had when he has played them in the past.

Focusing more toward the mid lane may be an attempt on Royal Never Give Up’s part to give xiaohu more responsibility and confidence to carry games. So far, it isn’t working. xiaohu’s story this split has shared some similarities with that of Luck ""Perkz"" Perkovic’s of the EU LCS’ G2 Esports. The jungle and mid lane duo owned Royal in Spring, but he's been displaced. Two champions he relied upon heavily earlier, Azir and LeBlanc, fell out of favor, and xiaohu’s confidence plummeted, even as he was able to latch onto Taliyah.

""In my current state,"" xiaohu said at the press conference following the LPL final in Guangzhou, ""I feel like, no matter which mid laner I face, I won't be a match for him."" He has tried unsuccessfully to find a new place on a team that is increasingly bottom lane focused.

For Uzi’s successful teams in the past, the mid laner’s go-to has been Orianna. Even in an assassin-driven meta, Orianna was Wh1t3zZ's most picked champion at Worlds. Orianna was one of two champions Star Horn Royal Club mid laner Lie ""corn"" Wen was known to play with a high degree of competency, and at the 2014 World Championship, Orianna, Lulu and Zilean were played in 70 percent of Royal’s games.

This time around, buffs to Orianna hit on patches 6.16 and 6.17, but recent basic mistakes made by both xiaohu and Mata, two of Royal’s strongest assets at the Mid-Season Invitational, indicate it isn't likely to make a major difference. If Uzi is impacting their under-performance, it isn't directly.

The missing link for Royal, this time around, is a surge in synergy and strategy. In 2013, Tabe’s innovation with Annie support, and the team’s decision to run the duo in the mid lane to increase jungle control gave them a boost against their domestic competitors, especially the mid and jungle-centric OMG.

In 2014, despite clashes between Uzi and jungler Choi ""inSec"" Inseok behind the scenes, the sudden shift to the 2v2 bottom lane meta with increased dragon gold and the buffing of Lucian allowed Uzi and Zero to pressure advantages while inSec ganked bottom lane heavily. It was hard for the enemy team to punish Uzi’s over-aggression when mid lane champions like Orianna and Lulu were a staple, and the support meta swung to include the disengage and protective powers of Janna.

Penicillium commune is an indoor fungus belonging to the genus of Penicillium. It is known as one of the most common fungi spoilage moulds on cheese. It also grows on and spoils other foods such as meat products and fat-containing products like nuts and margarine. Cyclopiazonic acid and regulovasine A and B are the most important mycotoxins produced by P. commune. The fungus is the only known species to be able to produce both penitrem A and roquefortine. Although this species does not produce penicillin, it has shown to have anti-pathogenic activity. There are no known plant, animal or human diseases caused by P. commune.

History and taxonomy
The fungus species was first described by the American mycologist Dr. Charles Thom in 1910. Penicillium commune is considered an ancestral wild-type of the fungus species P. camemberti, a mould commonly used in the production of soft cheese. Both species are similar in their ability to produce cyclopiazonic acid, a metabolite not normally produced by members of the genus Penicillium. P. commune, by contrast, is a saprotroph that produces soft, fluffy cotton-like colonies. In their 1949 monograph of the genus, Raper and Thom treated P. commune and P. lanosum in subsection Lanata. P. commune (Thom) was included in the series along with. Since then, there"

Altogether, six public health facilities were selected, two each from hospitals, primary healthcare centres and health posts, with the major hospital included as one of the hospitals (as per WHO guidelines). These health facilities were used as the basis for selecting the private pharmacies.

Private pharmacies to include in the study were selected from a list made available by the Nepal Chemists and Druggists Association (NCDA), Lumbini, Nepal. Separate pharmacies and pharmacies attached to private hospitals were included to represent both types. The NCDA list was verified after visiting each selected survey area and updated by deleting any duplicates in the list of pharmacies and adding any missing from the records. In total, 441 private pharmacies were in the NCDA list. Among them, 49 did not exist in the field while 31 were missing on the list. After adjusting the list for these pharmacies, 423 private pharmacies were included in the final list.

As outlined in the WHO guidelines, within each survey area, pharmacies on the final list were grouped according to whether they were located within or beyond 5 km from each selected public health facility. Within each group in every survey area, pharmacies were assigned a number and then selected for inclusion in the study using a random number generator, with three private facilities selected from the within the 5 km group and two selected from the \>5 km group. Three private pharmacies were added to the original sample due to refusal of the initially selected pharmacies to allow data collection on the second day. Each pharmacy was surveyed for 2 days, other than the three that refused data to be collected on the second day and the three replacement pharmacies, which were surveyed for 1 day. Thus, data collection covered 60 days with 33 private pharmacies (2 days per pharmacy for 27 pharmacies and 1 day per pharmacy for 6 pharmacies).

Data collection {#s2-1}
---------------

Private pharmacies in Nepal do not follow the practice of keeping patients' records, so exit interviews were conducted with patients who had attended the selected pharmacies. Interviews were conducted from July 2017 to December 2017 from 09:00 to 17:00. The days allocated for data collection were based on the advice of pharmacists to obtain as representative a sample of days as possible. Patients were invited to participate based on convenience sampling, with as many patients as possible who attended the selected pharmacies approached to participate. In total, 1554 patients were approached, with 15 (1%) patients refusing to participate and 1537 patients included in the study. Individuals obtaining medicines on behalf of another person were excluded from the exit interviews as they may not have been able to provide the relevant details about the patient or their condition. In contrast, parents have these details for their children so children attending the pharmacies with their parents were included in the survey.

Data were collected using the Qualtrics Offline Surveys Application.[@R26] Demographic characteristics of the patients for whom the medicines had been bought (age, sex), the disease or condition and sources of antibiotic[@R27] (self-medicated, recommended and supplied by a pharmacist or drug retailer without a prescription, prescribed by a doctor and dispensed by a pharmacist or drug retailer, other) were collected. Photographs were taken of the medicines, with no patient identifiers included, and attached to the application. The maximum time taken for the exit interview was 3 min. Prior to the interview, all consumers were informed of the nature of the study and written consent was sought to interviews being conducted. Consent for patients younger than 18 years was sought from the accompanying parent or caretaker.

The principal researcher coordinated data collection and approached respective authorities and health facilities to obtain approval to collect the data, and four Nepali research assistants were engaged in data collection. A training session for research assistants was held prior to embarking on data collection and focused on the aim of the study, the importance of ensuring quality in the data collection and ethical considerations. The research assistants were regularly monitored by the principal researcher to ensure the quality of the data through observation at the study sites and cross-checking of the entered records in the Qualtrics Application.

In addition to the J.D., the school offers two graduate degrees in law: The Master of Laws (LL.M.) the Doctor of Laws (S.J.D.) program. The five specialized LL.M. programs are in: maritime law, energy and environmental law, American business law, American law, and international and comparative law.  LL.M. students may also pursue a general LL.M., which does not concentrate in any one area.

The law school offers six live-client clinical programs, in the areas of: civil litigation, criminal defense, juvenile litigation, legislative and administrative advocacy, domestic violence, and environmental law (the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic). In addition, there is a trial-advocacy program, and third-year students may engage in externships with federal and state judges, with a local death-penalty project, or with certain administrative agencies.  The judicial externships are possible because of Tulane's close proximity to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Supreme Court, all of which are in New Orleans. The school was the first in the country to institute a pro bono program requiring that each student complete legally related community service prior to graduation.

Every summer, BarBri, a national bar exam-preparation company, offers New York Bar Exam and Louisiana Bar Exam preparation courses at the Tulane Law School. Additionally, a California Bar Exam preparation course is offered when demand warrants it, as it did in 2010.

Study abroad programs 
Tulane Law School was one of the first five schools in the United States to offer a foreign summer law program. As of 2008, over 4,000 law students from approximately 140 U.S. law schools attended Tulane Law's summer abroad programs, taught by faculty from Tulane, other U.S. law schools, and universities abroad. Through the years, prominent scholars and federal judges have highlighted Tulane's summer faculty, including Supreme Court justices Harry Blackmun, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, and William Rehnquist. In the past, the law school's summer programs have taken place in Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Berlin in Germany; Cambridge and London in England; Paris and Grenoble in France; Rhodes and Spetses in Greece; and Siena in Italy.

JD/MBA program
Tulane benefits from having a top law school and a top business school located immediately next to one another, both of which consistently rank among the top 50 in the nation, according to the U.S. News & World Report and the Financial Times (the Finance department in particular has been ranked among the top 10 in the world on several occasions).  This close proximity has facilitated the growth of Tulane's JD/MBA program.  In the '06-'07 school year, Tulane boasted of having 25 joint JD/MBA candidates. In March 2007, Tulane announced that it had hired a new business law professor, whose objectives would include ""maximiz[ing]...the growth of the Law School's JD/MBA joint degree,"" and strengthening ties between the law school and Freeman School of Business. In January 2008, the Tulane JD/MBA Club held a networking event in New York City with the creator of jdmba.com, an interschool JD/MBA networking website.

Recent JD/MBA graduates have gone on to work for law firms, management consulting firms, investment banks, and in-house legal departments in New York, Houston, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and other cities. The program does not require highly qualified applicants to have significant full-time work experience.

42,8,5943,"The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition in the form of tablets or capsules which provides a combination of spatial and temporal control of drug delivery to a patient for effective therapeutic results. The pharmaceutical composition comprises an active ingredient or drug, a gas, generating component, a swelling agent, a viscolyzing agent, and optionally a galling polymer. The swelling agent belongs to a class of highly absorbent compounds commonly referred to as superdisintegrants. This class of compounds includes, for example, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone and cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose. The viscolyzing agent is a highly viscous material which upon contact with gastric fluid entraps the gas produced by the gas generating component. The viscolyzing agent consists of, for example, a carbohydrate gum. The gelling polymer is preferably a cross-linkable galling polymer, such as a water soluble salt of one or more polyuronic acids, e.g., sodium alginate.
The improved controlled drug delivery system of the present invention is designed to deliver effectively a drug to a patient over a specific time period (temporal control) and from a particular portion of the patient's gastrointestinal tract (spatial control). The improved controlled drug delivery system avoids dose dumping and results in the most therapeutic administration of a particular drug to a person with a particular ailment.
It is well known to those skilled in the art that for ailments requiring multiple doses of a particular drug, the blood levels of a drug need to be maintained above its minimum effective level and below its minimum toxic level in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effects, to avoid undesired toxic effects, and to minimize side effects. When the blood levels of a drug are in this range, the drug is eliminated from the body at a particular rate. A controlled drug delivery system is usually designed to deliver the drug at this particular rate; safe and effective blood levels are maintained for a period as long as the system continues to deliver the drug at this rate.

43,6,18662,"As Texas debates what, if any, steps should be taken to prevent mass shootings in the state, we asked our audience what questions they had about guns in schools.

A common question was whether why regulations on automatic weapons differ from those regulating semiautomatic ones:

Why don't we treat all semi-automatic weapons the same as we treat automatic weaponry?– R. Anthony Steele

The simple answer: There are just too many semi-automatic weapons – and fully automatic weapons have been regulated pretty much since they were invented.

But exactly how many semiautomatic weapons are out there?

“Most pistols today are semiautomatics,” says Jurgen Brauer, a firearms researcher and professor at Augusta University. Brauer compares the mass adoption of the semi-automatic gun to the adoption of smartphones over landlines and streaming over broadcast TV.

And while it’s hard to say exactly how many semiautomatic weapons are circulating in the U.S, experts say the number is arguably high. A Washington Post estimate in 2015 put the number of all firearms in America at 357 million – a number larger than the U.S. population.

Credit via Wikimedia Commons An undated photo of J.T. Thompson holding an M1921 ""Tommy"" gun.

The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives says semiautomatic handguns are the most commonly used in crimes. On a federal level, that popularity is a result of a lack of sweeping regulation of semiautomatics.

For most of the 20th century, semiautomatics overall were sparsely regulated.

That is, until 1994, when the Federal Assault Weapons Ban went into effect. It prohibited the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic guns with large-capacity magazines – those holding more than 10 rounds – to civilians.

The law was intended to reduce gun deaths, but when it expired in 2004, researchers couldn’t really say if it did or didn’t have an overall impact.

Researchers at the National Institute of Justice found they couldn’t “make definitive assessments of the ban’s impact on gun violence,” adding that assault weapons are rarely used by criminals and the laws may have easy workarounds.

Fully automatic guns are a different story.

During the Prohibition era, fully automatic firearms were completely legal and readily available. Ads for the Thompson submachine gun, the most popular, were featured in magazines. One ad depicted a rancher using the “powerful, yet simply operated machine gun"" that would set you back $300 – about $5,400 today.

In response to organized crime and the attempted assassination of President Franklin Roosevelt, the feds clamped down on certain types of guns – namely the Thompson and the Browning Automatic Rifle, the gun infamously used by Bonnie and Clyde Barrow.

In 1934, immediately after the repeal of Prohibition, Congress passed the National Firearms Act, which restricted the sale, transfer and manufacturing of fully automatic weapons, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and suppressors. The law required these weapons to be registered, and owners had to pay a $200 tax – a cost-prohibitive fee for most people. To this day, would-be owners still have to pay that $200 tax.

Decades later, a few other laws solidified restrictions on automatic weapons. The Gun Control Act of 1968 outlawed imports of automatic weapons. The Hughes Amendment, which bans civilian ownership of fully automatic weapons not registered by 1986, followed shortly after. The laws worked in tandem to make automatic weapons rare, expensive and difficult to own.

The proliferation of mass shootings has prompted a discussion over stricter regulation of semiautomatic weapons – namely, assault-style weapons.

I’ve only been working with Kelly a few weeks, and I’ve achieved more in the last 2 weeks on moving my business forward than I have for the last 8 months! The reason – I’ve procrastinated for ages about a project, just because I wasn’t sure which technical tools would best help me achieve my goal. There was also a secondary fear I guess about whether, once I’d worked out what tools to use, I could manage to set them up correctly! However, one phone call to Kelly and everything got sorted. She listened to my plans, advised the best route for what I wanted to achieve, and is now helping me set it all up. She’s friendly, helpful, there to answer any questions – and extremely cost-effective. It’s fantastic having her help my business. My only regret – I wish I’d called Kelly sooner!

The Roving Picket Movement was the culmination of years of unrest from mine workers about their working conditions in the Appalachian region. The movement lasted from 1959-1965, with goals of reinstating health benefits and improving working conditions. Miners protested at several mines in Eastern Kentucky, and laid and the foundation for future movements within the Appalachian coal community.

Background 

During World War II, The Unites States of America provided a large portion of the Allied Powers' resources, which caused a huge spike in production that needed to be powered by coal. However, after WWII, this production was no longer necessary, which also decreased the need for coal. Because of this, the coal industry fell into a slump, dropping from 16.0 quadrillion BTU (of total energy use) to 12.0 quadrillion BTU from 1945 to 1949. To counter this loss, the United Mine Workers Association, or the UMW"

These peaks appear to be present in all spectra, and their intensity is in general proportional to total protein. We further tested normalization against other peaks, matrix adducts, total protein (Micro BCA see ""Protein Quantification"" below), and myoglobin doped into each spot (data not shown). For these data, all gave a similar response. Because we were only scoring for the presence or absence of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, this experimentally works to elucidate mutations in ESX-1, with sufficient correction of common sample, and MALDI spot-spot variability.

#### LC/MS/MS

Colony washates from *M. marinum* or *P. aeruginosa* were digested and analyzed as previously described ([@B27]). Briefly, the samples were denatured with 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol, reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). The samples were cleaned with a C18 ZipTip (Millipore), dried, and resuspended in 12 μl of 1% formic acid. LC/MS/MS was performed on a 100-μm × 100-mm C18 BEH column (Waters, Milford, MA) coupled to a two-dimensional Nano Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) system running at 600 nl/min. A 60-min gradient to 30% ACN was used. MS and MS/MS analysis was performed on a QTrap5500 (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA) running a TOP8 data-dependent method. Peak lists were generated with Protein Pilot (ABSciex) 4.0.8085 Rev 148085 and searched using the Paragon algorithm within the software (4.0.0.0 148083). Enzyme specificity was trypsin, two missed cleavages are allowed, and search was performed with carboxyamidomethylation of Cys as the only fixed modification with variable modification of carboxyamidomethylation at Lys and peptide/protein N termini. Further variable modifications not utilized in this study are searched automatically by Paragon, the details of which are outlined in Ref. [@B39]. Mass tolerance of precursors was set to those of an ion trap instrument, which typically includes ±0.3 atomic mass unit including the possibility of precursors falling within the isolation range (∼0.7 atomic mass unit). A current FASTA (June 1, 2011) of *M. marinum* download from Marinolist ([@B45]) or NCBI, respectively (November 1, 2011) (combined with an in-house contaminant list; approximately 500 entries), was searched. This combined protein list contained 11,158 protein entries. *P. aeruginosa* PA01 FASTA was downloaded November 20, 2011 from NCBI (<ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria>) combined with the in-house contaminant list and contained 11,460 protein entries. Individual MS/MS spectra ([supplemental materials](http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M112.017533/DC1)) were considered if their individual confidence values exceeded 95%.

Brian and Carla Restid, a couple in their mid-60s, bought life insurance four years ago to protect their lifestyle in retirement. A year later, they upgraded to a pilot program offered by the insurer to get fitter, healthier and more energized.

In exchange for working to improve their well-being and providing details about the process, they have saved $700 so far in premiums.

“It provided a way for me to be accountable to myself,” said Carla Restid, 67, who has an autoimmune disease that has slowed her down. “It provided me a way to get going and keep going. I was exercising before, but it wasn’t at the forefront of my mind. This set me on a life-changing program.”

Starting Wednesday, the program they joined, known as Vitality, will be included in all new life insurance policies underwritten by John Hancock, the financial services company. The program was developed in conjunction with Vitality, a South African company that works with insurers around the world on similar programs.

“Vitality has been an optional benefit,” said Brooks Tingle, president and CEO of John Hancock Insurance. “Now, we’re saying we won’t issue life insurance policies without these Vitality benefits on them.”

If they participate, customers will be able to reduce annual premiums by as much as 15 percent, but they will also be asked to report their habits on eating, drinking and exercise — or lack thereof — to their insurance company.

Safeway Insurance Company appeals a judgment declaring that an uninsured motorist (UM) rejection form signed by Linda Thomas was invalid. For the following reasons, we reverse and render.

Facts
Ms. Thomas filed the present suit on November 24, 1997, alleging that her Safeway automobile policy with liability limits of $10,000/$20,000 also provided UM coverage for an accident of September 9, 1996. Safeway later filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Ms. Thomas validly rejected UM coverage when she applied for her policy of insurance on December 29, 1995. Ms. Thomas also filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the rejection form she signed was insufficient to provide a ""meaningful selection"" of UM coverage.
The Safeway form signed by Ms. Thomas provided:

Randomly Generated Dungeons.

Dungeons can contain multiple rooms, corridors & side branches. There is a chance for treasure to be found in the dungeon rooms, and there are even ""secret"" rooms hidden near the dungeons. These ""secret"" rooms have a floor made of Lapis Blocks and a Gold Treasure Chest.





Randomly Generated Ancient Ruins.

Most of the time they are buried under the surface, but sometimes they can be found aboveground. Dig underneath these Ancient Ruins to find Buried Treasure!





2 types of Buried Treasure:

Iron Treasure Chests contain mostly common or semi-rare items/blocks. Gold Treasure Chests are harder to find, and contain mostly rare items/blocks, including diamonds, clay, cookies, etc.





Tips for finding the Ruins and Dungeons:

Surface Ruins

* Made of cobblestone and mossy cobble, sometimes with vines hanging from them.

* About 20% of the time, these ruins will be found on the surface, no further than about 8 blocks above sea level. The other 80% of the time, the ruin will be buried just under the surface, and in some cases just a couple"

56,13,26319,"Introduction {#s1}
============

Connexin 32 (Cx32) is a 32 kDa protein of the connexin family, abundantly found in liver (Paul, [@B72]), but it is also expressed in many other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Scherer et al., [@B82]; Rash et al., [@B76]). Mutations in the *GJB1* gene, which encodes Cx32, are the leading cause of the X-linked dominant form of Charcot--Marie--Tooth disease (CMT1X or CMTX1), the second most common form of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy and a disease for which there is no cure (Kleopa and Scherer, [@B46]; Kleopa et al., [@B45]). Since mutations were first reported in 1993 (Bergoffen et al., [@B14]), over 450 different mutations associated with CMT1X including missense, frameshift, deletion and non-sense ones have been identified according to The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD^®^; Stenson et al., [@B86]). In both nerves and ganglia of the PNS, Cx32 localizes only in myelinating Schwann cells (SCs), mainly to the paranodes, the periodic interruptions in the compact myelin called Schmidt--Lanterman incisures, and the two outer layers of myelin (Scherer et al., [@B82]; Meier et al., [@B59]; Procacci et al., [@B74]). Elucidation of the molecular function of Cx32 in myelinating SCs is a requirement for understanding how different mutations lead to the sequence of events that end in demyelination and axonal loss in CMT1X patients. Despite the availability of an incredible number of studies, mostly *in vitro*, focusing on normal and mutated Cx32 channel properties, an interpretative framework is still lacking.

Cx32 Gap Junction Channels in Non-compact Regions of Myelinating Schwann Cells {#s1-1}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minute intracellular gap junction (GJ) channels are formed in non-compact regions of SC myelin when hexamers of Cx32 (connexons or hemichannels) spanning opposite myelin layers dock end-to-end (Meier et al., [@B59]), providing a fast diffusive radial path between the abaxonal and adaxonal region (Balice-Gordon et al., [@B12]). This has led to the attractive hypothesis that Cx32 GJ channels are critical for the passage of K^+^ and signaling molecules across the myelin sheath of SCs, whose function is not only to myelinate axons but also to maintain their long-term functional integrity (Nave and Trapp, [@B63]). The overlap in the distribution of Cx32 and Cx29 at incisures and paranodes suggests that they both contribute to"

For models (B), starting with $\log g$ = 2.5, gravity increases as contraction proceeds and favors H$_2$ molecular formation, yielding significantly flatter atmospheric profiles, as mentioned above. This yields a significant increase of $\te$ at fixed mass $m$ as contraction proceeds (Chabrier & Baraffe, 2000, §3.2). For $\alpha_{\rm mix}$ = 2, the sensitivity of atmosphere profiles to $g$ is less pronounced, but still yields up to 200 K differences between models (A) and (B) at a given age.

The effect on evolutionary tracks in a HRD is displayed in Figure \[fig6\]. Note that evolution along the Hayashi line does not necessarily proceed at constant $\te$, because of the effects described above.

Rewrite procedure to search for open excel workbook

I wrote the procedure below to check for an open instance of Excel and then check to see if a particular workbook was opened, if the workbook is opened, then go to the selected sheet.
The procedure works OK, but I am not particularly happy with the way I wrote it. For example, on the following lines, the procedure checks if the workbook is opened, if not, it goes out to the path and opens it by using the Catch.
  Dim xlWBName As String = ""2011.1004.Compensation Template""
  Dim xlBookPath As String = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())

    xlApp.Visible = True

    Try

        'get the opened workbook

        xlBook = xlApp.Workbooks(xlWBName & "".xlsx"")

    Catch ex As Exception

        'open it
        xlBook = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(xlBookPath & ""\"" & xlWBName & "".xlsx"")

    End Try

I don't want to use the Catch as the way to open my workbook if it is not already opened. I rather use it for a true exception such as the workbook not being in the directory. My question is, how can re-write this procedure to better do what I want. Here is my entire procedure:
Public Sub GoToSheets(sheetName As String)
Cursor.Current = Cursors.AppStarting

Try
    'get an existing excel.application object

No, that's not right at all.

We need to show that for any a, b and c in A, if a~b and b~c, then a~c.

So suppose a, b and c in A and a~b and b~c. So, by definition of '~' we have aRb and bRa and bRc and cRb. So, since we have aRb and bRc, by transitivity of R, we have aRc. And, since we have cRb and bRa, by transitivity of R, we have cRa. So we have both aRc and cRa, so, by definition of '~', we have a~c.

what about this approach for (2)
a, b exist in A and a~b implies a = b

No, that is incorrect. There is no basis for to infer a = b.

That makes no sense to me at all; where did 'n' come from? a and b are just variables ranging over ANY kind of thing, not necessarily numbers of any kind.

Please take whatever time it takes to understand the proofs I gave. Those are the most straightforward kind of proofs for this kind of problem. You shouldn't complicate the problem with notions about bijections and mod and things that aren't pertinent to the problem.

Okay, I am following your thought process on those proofs. So would #2, 3, and 4 follow the same idea? I think 4 is a bit more specific instead of general. But for #2 and 3 do we follow the process of:

a ~ b if an only if aRb and bRa. So ~ is an equivalence relation on S. This is b/c we define a partial order relation < on equivalence classes of sets under ~ by saying that [a] < [b] if and only if aRb.

a ~ b if an only if aRb and bRa. So ~ is an equivalence relation on S.

(I don't know what S is.) In (1) we showed that ~ is an equivalence relation on A.

Are you asking about question (2) now? There we are asked to show:

If [a] = [c] and [b] = [d] and [a] < [b], then [c] < [d].

So assume [a] = [c] and [b] = [d] and [a] < [b].

Now, unpack those statements, and unpack what you want to prove, which is [c] < [d]. Then see how you can use all that unpacked information to prove [c] < [d].

By the way, this exercise is an example of an important and common technique in mathematics. The set of equivalence classes induced by an equivalence relation on a non-empty set A is a partition of A. To show that a relation on a partition is properly defined by definining it in terms of arbitrary members of the equivalence classes, we have to show that it doesn't matter which members of the equivalence classes we choose, as for example, to know that addition of rational numbers is well defined we have to know, e.g., that 1"

### Patients {#Sec8}

In cooperation with the FMT-HVD, 33 patients were recruited, who had been diagnosed with malaria and were at the final stage of treatment. The youngest patient was 10 years old and the oldest patient was 61 years old. Only one patient had been diagnosed with *Plasmodium falciparum*, while the others had been diagnosed with *P. vivax*, which is the most common species in the region. The study also indicated that the majority of patients (90.9%) reside in urban areas (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}).Table 1Characteristics of the 33 malaria patients and 22 health workers interviewedCharacteristicsPatientsHealth workersNumber3322Gender Male1812 Female1510Age group in years 10--1920 20--2960 30--3999 40--491012 50--5951 \> 6010Schooling in years 1--430 5--8104 9--121515 \> 1253Area of residence Urban3018 Rural34Plasmodium species *P. vivax*32N/A *P. falciparum*1N/AProfessional status Employed2122 Unemployed120Malaria experience in years 1--5N/A1 5--9N/A1 10--14N/A7 \> 15N/A13Job function Administrative functionN/A7 MicroscopistN/A4 Field agentN/A8 DriverN/A3

66,7,3978,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- During a break early in the second half of the Big 12 tournament title game, Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg gathered his team in front of the bench and asked them a simple question:

""How much do you have left?""

The answer turned out to be just enough.

After digging a 17-point hole against ninth-ranked Kansas, the Cyclones put together another of their trademark comebacks. Georges Niang led the way with 19 points, Abdel Nader made the go-ahead foul shots with 48 seconds left, and No. 13 Iowa State beat the Jayhawks 70-66 to win its second consecutive tournament championship.

""We got down 17, and they were still talking and positive in the huddle,"" Hoiberg said, ""and that's a great sign, when your guys can stick together through adversity.""

They're getting quite accustomed to it.

It was the fifth straight game -- including all three in the tournament -- that the Cyclones rallied from a double-digit deficit, prompting Niang to dub his teammates the ""Comeback Kids.""

""We don't want to come back every time, but it just seems to keep happening to us,"" Niang said. ""If that's our emergency button, if that's what we have to do, we'll do it.""

Nader finished with 13 points, and Jameel McKay and Monte Morris had 11 each for the Cyclones (25-8), who also knocked off the Jayhawks on their way to winning the title a year ago.

As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the Cyclones streamed onto the floor and chants of ""I-S-U"" echoed through the Sprint Center, which was evenly split between the red-clad fans from the north and the blue-clad Kansas fans from the west.

Cyclones Keep Storming Back No Big 12 deficit appears too deep for No. 13 Iowa State, which has now won 5 straight games despite trailing by double digits in each of them. A look at the Cyclones' largest holes in their last five games: Deficit Won By Opponent Today -17 4 Kansas Mar. 13 -11 2 Oklahoma Mar. 12 -16 2 Texas Mar. 7 -10 13 TCU Mar. 2 -21 7 Oklahoma --ESPN Stats & Information

""We knew it's a long game, no matter what team you're playing,"" said the Jayhawks' Wayne Selden Jr., who had a career-high 25 points. ""Whether you're up or down, it's a long game.""

Frank Mason III had 13 points for the Jayhawks (26-8), who had their chances after Nader's two foul shots made it 65-63 with 48 seconds left.

Freshman guard Devonte Graham went to the basket but was out of control, turning the ball over, and Kansas quickly fouled. Morris made the second of two free throws with 23.8 seconds left.

Kansas still had a chance to tie the game with a 3, but coach Bill Self opted to drive to the rim. Mason missed a spinning layup, Dustin Hogue gathered in the rebound, and Iowa State began to celebrate its second consecutive championship and third overall.

""Coach always talks to us about fighting through adversity, staying together as a team,"" Nader said. ""That"

I’ve been rather quiet about Azimuth projects lately, because I’ve been too busy actually working on them. Here’s some of what’s happening:

• Jason Erbele is finishing his thesis, entitled Categories in Control: Applied PROPs. He successfully gave his thesis defense on Wednesday June 8th, but he needs to polish it up some more. Building on the material in our paper “Categories in control”, he’s defined a category where the morphisms are signal flow diagrams. But interestingly, not all the diagrams you can draw are actually considered useful in control theory! So he’s also found a subcategory where the morphisms are the ‘good’ signal flow diagrams, the ones control theorists like. For these he studies familiar concepts like controllability and observability. When his thesis is done I’ll announce it here.

• Brendan Fong is also finishing his thesis, called The Algebra of Open and Interconnected Systems. Brendan has already created a powerful formalism for studying open systems: the decorated cospan formalism. We’ve applied it to two examples: electrical circuits and Markov processes. Lately he’s been developing the formalism further, and this will appear in his thesis. Again, I’ll talk about it when he’s done!

In the UK, the government has scrapped support for onshore wind, killed off the flagship green home scheme, sold off the green investment bank, watered down the incentive to buy a greener car, ditched the green tax target, and refused tidal power, among other regressive actions.

Meanwhile, London’s Heathrow Airport has approved a third runway that will increase the airport’s emissions by 7.3m tonnes — the carbon equivalent of more than the country of Cyprus. Fracking is tax subsidized, even though an increase in global methane emissions has been linked to fracking. Dr. Bradbrook’s presentation underscores how the UK is experiencing its worst period of environmental policy in 30 years.

“The scope of the crisis shows starkly just how massively our governments have failed us,” Lizia told Truthout of this aspect of the crisis.

“I have heard stories from generations above about retirement pensions, adequate healthcare, easy access to higher education, owning houses and vehicles… but in my own short lifetime I have witnessed spiraling desperation and consequent emotional detachment, apathy and abuse in the people around me from the failing of many vital services,” she said. “What on Earth will the result be to sit back and let those in charge handle an issue of this magnitude?”

And in the US, under the Trump administration, the situation is far worse.

However, a detailed examination of serial MRI of the lateral meniscus and the popliteus tendon reveals that there is neither duplication nor deficiency in the lateral meniscus, and the structure that appears to be the posterior segment of the lateral meniscus is actually the popliteus tendon. Arthroscopy revealed a fibrous band that connected the popliteus tendon to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus ([Figure 2(c)](#fig2){ref-type=""fig""}). As the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was dislocated anteriorly, the popliteus tendon might be pulled anteriorly onto the articular surface of the LTP by the fibrous band, which was considered to be the posteroinferior (or third) popliteomeniscal fascicle \[[@B15], [@B16]\].

The reason why we did not perform any interventions for the subluxated lateral menisci during arthroscopic examination is that the patient declined intensive treatment, because she was busy with child rearing and her job at that time. However, if the patient had wanted to undergo thorough treatment, we would have released the adhesion between the lateral meniscus and tissue inside the intercondylar space and reduced the subluxated meniscus to the normal position after making sure that the size of the lateral meniscus is large enough. Based on our experience with other patients in whom the lateral meniscus had been kept subluxated for more than 1 month and had then been reduced to the normal position arthroscopically, such a meniscus is liable to undergo redislocation to the same position during even slight flexion of the knee joint. To break this predisposition, we recommend two-stage treatment. First, the knee joint is kept in a straight position with a plaster cast for 3 weeks after reduction of the lateral meniscus to the normal position. The patient is then encouraged to walk with full weight bearing on the knee joint after the correct position of the lateral meniscus is verified on MRI. Reposition of the posterior segment of the lateral meniscus can push the popliteus tendon off the LTP to the normal position, which makes meniscocapsular suture \[[@B5], [@B6]\] possible. Active flexion exercise of the knee joint is started after the plaster cast is removed. Second, if subluxation of the lateral meniscus recurs, immediate repositioning of the meniscus and meniscocapsular suture, which would be much easier compared to at first repositioning of the meniscus, are performed simultaneously.

As PSLM seems to remain clinically silent until the occurrence of an osteochondral fracture or osteoarthritis caused by the loss of meniscal function, there would be little chance of detecting PSLM while patients are young. However, if a flipped meniscus sign of the lateral meniscus is detected on MRI in a knee joint without a history of trauma or locking symptoms, PSLM should be considered.

4. Conclusion {#sec4}
=============

Permanent subluxation of the lateral meniscus without tears or anomalies or a history of locking symptoms is a rare disorder. We recommend two-stage treatment for this pathology. First, the knee joint is kept straight for 3 weeks after reduction of the lateral meniscus to the normal position. Second, if subluxation of the lateral meniscus subsequently recurs, meniscocapsular suture is performed. We believe that this may pose a challenge clinically and radiologically; hence, preliminary knowledge of this condition is important.

""Here are some things working against you, when you are the primary breadwinner spouse within Marriage 2.0, and your spouse decides to walk out (cash out?) on you:

""1. Women Filing Majority of Divorces – 66-75% of all divorces are now filed by wives. Publications like Cosmo love to harp on men for having a 'fear of commitment'. Guys must ask themselves, why commit when it’s the other party who can’t live up to the commitment 3/4 of the time?

""2. Unilateral Divorce – This is also known as no-fault divorce, with no recourse for the other spouse. There is nothing you can do legally speaking to stop a divorce.

""3. Domestic Violence Fraud : Presumed guilty until proven innocent. DV laws are now widely used as the 'opening chess move' of many divorces. Once the husband is removed from the primary residence he never comes back, and she gets the primary residence in the asset split. Also known as the Federal VAWA Legislation, this new unconstitutional law has been fraudulently misused by divorcing spouses ever since it came out. There are no equivalent laws to protect men in abusive situations.

""4. Decriminalization of Adultery - Adultery is no longer a crime. However the failure to pay alimony to an adulterous spouse is. Go figure.

""5. Losing Custody of Children – Custody of the children is most often awarded to the lower-earner spouse in family courts. Basically this amounts to: Goodbye Daddy, hello ATM. When you read of cases like this October 2009 case where a little boy’s mother was arrested for prostitution and his stable/employed dad was still denied custody, you quickly understand how this loaded dice always rolls.

""6. Nonenforcement of Visitation Rights – States enforce payment obligations by non-custodial parents with an iron fist, however they don’t lift a finger to enforce the other side of the bargain, which is the visitation rights of non-custodial parents. If you are going to police one parent’s obligation to pay, why not police the other parent’s obligation to allow regular meaningful access to one’s children?

""7. Children as Cash cows - The National Organization for Women (NOW) has been lobbying against Shared Parenting bills in many states. Why would NOW do that? What is more equal than shared parenting? The reason is that NOW’s brand of feminism is no longer about equality, but about a zero-sum game for resources. Children are cash-cows, and NOW will be damned if they allow Shared Parenting to stop the cash-flow.

""8. No-Fault Alimony – In many states, fault is no longer a factor in awarding alimony. So there are plenty of cases of'spouse-A cheats, but spouse-B pays'. In what other area of contract law does the party breaking the contract gets paid, and the innocent party gets punished? Only in Marriage 2.0!

""9. One Sided Alimony: Ok so the ex-wife got used to a certain standard of living, so we will make the ex-husband pay alimony. Fine. But how about the things the ex-husband got used to? Do men have a right to be 'accustomed' to stuff too? If not, why not? Shouldn’t there be some sort of reciprocal reverse-alimony payment by the ex-wife in the form of weekly cleaning, a hot meal 7 nights a week, and 'romantic companionship' services for the ex-husband? How come one spouse is obligated to provide something that the other was used to during the marriage, and the other isn’t obligated to provide anything?

""10. Lifetime Alimony – Contrary to common belief, Alimony isn’t on its way out. There was a period in the 1970’s when no-fault laws were first enacted when a few states put limitations on how/when it could be awarded. However since then there have"

The first is documentation of the scandal in federal court, which in May included three top state Human Services Department officials refusing to answer a total of nearly 100 questions from lawyers. Instead, they asserted their Fifth Amendment rights, which allow people to avoid possibly incriminating themselves.

“We generally don’t see that,” Chu, the national synagogue organizer with Mazon, a California-based anti-hunger organization that tracks food stamp issues across the country.

The Fifth Amendment pleadings came after multiple HSD employees told the court of an alleged statewide practice of adding false resources to applications for emergency benefits through SNAP, the federal program formerly known as food stamps.

HSD officials encouraged the practice, according to nine employee testimonies, to clear backlogs of emergency SNAP applications that hadn’t been processed in the required amount of time. Federal law requires those emergency applicants, which only apply to the poorest of the poor, receive their benefits within seven days. Failure for a state to do so can lead to sanctions from the federal government.

George Mason revels in its sudden acclaim but hopes Final Four spotlight shines brightly on its academics too

March 28, 2006|By William Neikirk, Tribune senior correspondent.

FAIRFAX, Va. — In the heart of George Mason University's campus Monday, the American patriot's statue was decked out like a superhero.

A green T-shirt thrown over his head proclaimed, ""Go Kryptonite Kidz,"" a reference to the material that weakened Superman himself. There was a long Superman-like cape around the statue's neck. Near his left foot, a sign said, ""The slipper fits. Go Mason.""

Indeed a Cinderella atmosphere prevailed on this suburban campus of Washington, D.C., after the underdog George Mason Patriots upset top-seeded Connecticut on Sunday to vault into the Final Four of the NCAA tournament.

The team's success raised campus hopes that George Mason also would become known as the Cinderella university and wipe out a reputation as a commuter school inferior to such institutions as Georgetown, Virginia, William and Mary and George Washington.

At the college's Johnson Center, where students gather each day to dine and talk, there was a feeling that playing basketball well finally would give George Mason a chance to show it is on an academic par with better-recognized universities.

""I think we are going to get recognized more as a university,"" said Maya Scott, a senior who combines work and college and commutes to school 45 minutes from nearby Arlington. ""Academically, we have wonderful teachers and they are very passionate.""

""Mason is on the ups,"" said Matt Jupin, 20, a junior economics major, as he sat with his friend, Brian Giblin, a junior business major.

Yet professors and students would not deny that outsiders looked down upon the university's academic stature and that contributed to an inferiority complex they do not see as justified.

""Part of it is that we are so young,"" said Paula Crawford, an associate art professor. ""Nobody ever heard of us.""

No more.

There's nothing like success on the basketball court to get the nation's attention. The Patriots came out of nowhere to defeat powers such as Michigan State, North Carolina and Connecticut when few people knew where George Mason was located, much less the conference it represented--the Colonial Athletic Association.

Coach Jim Larranaga became a huge hero on campus for his ability to keep the team loose at big moments, such as telling his players on Sunday that CAA stood for Connecticut Assassins Association. And for his halftime pep talk in one game in which he referred to ""Kryptonite Mason"" as a team that could stop superheroes.

81,3,12418,"With the holiday season brings us a new holiday comedy entitled Office Christmas Party that’s sure to bring the raunchiness to the festive season. The following Office Christmas Party review will be spoiler free. Comment with your own thoughts at the bottom of the page to get the conversation going!

Background

Office Christmas Party stars Jason Bateman, T.J. Miller, Olivia Munn, and Kate McKinnon among other notable actors. The movie follows Clay Vanstone (Miller) as he tries to save the branch of his company from being closed by his sister Carol (Jennifer Aniston). In order to keep everyone employed and happy, Clay attempts to through a massive Christmas party in the office in order to lure Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance) into accepting a multi-million dollar offer so that no one from the company has to be laid off. Obviously, as the party ensues, things go awry and it’s up to a select few of the company to save the day.

I did not go into this movie with much expectations. A movie called “Office Christmas Party” is not going to win any Oscars any time soon, so I went into this movie just hoping for raunchy, ridiculous fun. I was really excited about the cast of this movie. Other than the main characters, there was a ton of really funny people in this movie such as Rob Corddry, Vanessa Bayer, and Jillian Bell just to name a few. With such talent involved, you expect the movie to be very, very funny.

Since it’s a holiday movie, you always hope that a new Christmas movie will join the ranks of the classics. Not that I expected much out of this movie, but you inherently want a movie surrounding Christmas to be incredibly enjoyable so that you can come to the holiday season every year and have another great movie to watch other than A Christmas Story and enjoy the most wonderful time of the year.

What I Liked

Office Christmas Party, however, is exactly what you expect it to be when you watch it. There is no new ground paved throughout the run time of this movie, but there is some laughs to be had. T.J. Miller, as always bring his A-game and brings a ton of laughs as the lovable loser of the branch of his company. Miller is responsible for my favorite line of movie which occurs towards the end of the film. Like in Deadpool earlier this year, he brings the great, over the top, and even somewhat offensive jokes that we needed from one of the main characters in an R-rated comedy. He received a lot of good laughs throughout the film from the audience.

I also really loved Kate McKinnon as the head of the human resources department of the company that slowly lets go of her inhibitions as we progress throughout the movie. McKinnon, at first, attempts to not offend anyone by her non-denominational Christmas sweater among other things and then suddenly flips a switch towards the end of the movie. She almost every scene with her quick, unexpected quips that you can’t help but laugh at from their absurdity. She’s great at playing the straight girl to the ridiculousness that is happening around her.

What I Didn’t Like

However, this movie clearly has issues which this Office Christmas Party review will get into.

The main characters of the movie are arguably Jason Bateman and Olivia Munn who, unfortunately, are not given much to do throughout the film. Their performances are by no means bad, but some of their jokes fall flat and they’re not given much to do otherwise. They’re mostly “meh” throughout the movie. A classic Christmas movie needs some better leads than what we got in Office Christmas Party.

Other than the office party itself (which is very fun), the movie often gets derailed in unfunny, annoying action. A lot of the subplots try really hard to be over-the-top funny but never get there. These plot moments mostly revolve around Jillian Bell who plays a pimp. She mostly gets on your nerves and is very off-putting. There’s some very contrived and dumb bits that are supposed to get laughs but fall very, very flat and are even somewhat irritating.

While you shouldn’t expect the story of a comedy such as Office Christmas Party to be Oscar-award winning, it should not be completely predictable. As this movie plays out, you can easily guess what is"

A student enrolled in a graduate degree program in either conditionally classified or classified standing shall be subject to academic probation if he or she fails to maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 in all units attempted; no course in which the student receives lower than a C may be counted toward a Master’s degree. Students may also be placed on Administrative-Academic Probation or Administrative-Academic Disqualification subject to the conditions described in the Catalog.

Reinstatement

In order to be considered for reinstatement to CSUCI, a disqualified student must demonstrate academic ability by completing additional coursework. All classes taken must be applicable for degree credit at CSUCI. After eliminating the grade-point deficiency, the student may petition the Academic Appeals Board for reinstatement. The student must submit the petition for reinstatement no later than three weeks before the beginning of the semester that the student intends to return. The Academic Appeals Board will only consider the petition for reinstatement of students who have remained outside of the university for at least one regular (Fall or Spring) semester after their dismissal. Students who are disqualified, reinstated, and become disqualified a second time will not be granted a second reinstatement.

Acceleration of University Studies

The University provides several means by which students may accelerate their studies; these are discussed below. Each of the following options may be subject to restrictions and regulations within individual academic programs. Therefore, students interested in any of these options should consult with the catalog and/or chair of the concerned program.

Graduation

To qualify for graduation, students must complete all requirements for the bachelor’s/master’s degree by the official graduation date listed in the Schedule of Classes. Graduation is not automatic upon the completion of requirements. Students who intend to graduate must take the initiative and should follow the key steps listed in the Catalog. While students are ultimately responsible for completing all degree requirements, assistance is available through faculty advisement, the Advising Center, and Graduation Evaluations. It is important that students meet regularly with an advisor to avoid graduation problems and delays.

The Application for Degree and Diploma, and filing fee entitle students to an official graduation evaluation of progress toward meeting baccalaureate degree requirements. Students qualifying for graduation by the designated graduation date may participate in the annual commencement ceremony. The application for degree is available at the Advising Center in the Bell Tower and at the Enrollment Center in Sage Hall.

86,13,26427,"GMOs, HYBRIDS AND HEIRLOOMS: THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE

Many controversies have been going on as to which type of food we should eat. Consumers are clamouring for safe food with no health risk and that its production should be environmentally friendly. Should it be food that is genetically modified or hybrid or of heirloom origin? Is Hybrid GMOs and vice versa? Are breakthroughs in biotechnology evil?

First and foremost, it is important to explain the difference among GMOs, Hybrids and Heirlooms. Heirloom is defined as the first generation seeds that are organic. They are save to eat but with low productivity. E.g. you get 2,000 kg tomatoes on 1 hectare. Moreover, shapes of fruits are uniform, preservation is poor, etc. One can save the seeds from fruits and plant it again.

Also, hybrids are as a result of Cross breeding of heirlooms to achieve a better variety. For example, you cross a tomato plant that has high preservation with one that is sweet and another that has oval shape. So, you get like 60,000 kg of fruits per hectare, sweet fruits, more disease resistance, uniform fruit shape that is attractive. Note that it takes trial and error to achieve a good hybrid variety and it takes more generations which is time consuming but technology has made it possible"

Microvesicles (also called microparticles) have become a hot topic recently and transport proteins, mRNA, and microRNA.1–3 They have been proposed to play roles in numerous processes, including coagulation, inflammation, immune response, cell activation, and cancer.1–3 Microvesicles are small (0.1–1 μm) membrane vesicles that are released from activated and apoptotic cells. They contain proteins from their parental cell and are characterized by surface exposure of negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine. Platelets are the primary source of microvesicles in the circulation of healthy individuals, although other cells also release microvesicles. Increased levels of microvesicles are observed in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including unstable angina, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory vascular diseases. Some microvesicle populations are considered as surrogate biomarkers of vascular disorders and of thrombotic risk.2,3

The steady-state level of microvesicles in the circulation reflects a balance between microvesicle generation and clearance. Numerous studies have analyzed the mechanisms of microvesicle formation.1 Stimulation of cells leads to elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+, which results in increased phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, membrane blebbing, and subsequent shedding of microvesicles.1 The importance of phosphatidylserine exposure on platelets and possibly microvesicles in hemostasis is demonstrated by Scott syndrome, a rare bleeding disorder associated with a defect in phosphatidylserine externalization and in microvesicle generation.1 Recently, it was reported that Scott syndrome patients have a mutation in a bidirectional, nonselective Ca2+-dependent channel called TMEM16F.4

In this issue of Circulation, Dasgupta and colleagues5 describe a new pathway of microvesicle clearance from the circulation that involves binding of phosphatidylserine-positive microvesicles to endothelial cells (Figure). Previously, Dasgupta and colleagues6 reported that the major pathway for the removal of microvesicles from the circulation was via binding to splenic macrophages (Figure). This pathway requires the presence of a glycoprotein called lactadherin (also known as milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8), which is secreted by activated macrophages and immature dendritic cells.7 Lactadherin is a bifunctional protein that contains both discoidin I–like domains, which bind to phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells and microvesicles, and a tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, which binds to cellular integrins, such as αvβ3. In vitro studies demonstrated that lactadherin enhances platelet microvesicle binding and phagocytosis by macrophages.6 Lactadherin is not detected free in plasma of healthy individuals but has been found on the surface of platelet microvesicles.6 Interestingly, soluble lactadherin does not bind to αvβ3-positive cells (Dr G. Gilbert, unpublished data, 2008), which suggests that binding of lactadherin to phosphatidylserine-positive microvesicles changes its conformation to allow binding to αvβ3. Taken together, these results indicate that lactadherin bridges the binding of phosphatidylserine-positive microvesicles to splenic macrophages and facilitates their removal from the circulation. Under normal conditions, this appears to be a major pathway for microvesicle clearance from the circulation. Indeed, lactadherin-deficient mice have higher basal levels"
90,14,10257,"Donald Trump has called big-game trophy hunting a “horror show”, despite his own sons’ participation in elephant and leopard hunts, and in 2017 he formed an advisory board to steer US policy on the issue.

But rather than conservation scientists and wildlife advocates, it is composed of advocates for the hunting of elephants, giraffes and other threatened, charismatic species. And observers say that since Trump took office, court rulings and administrative decisions have in fact made it easier for hunters to import the body parts of lions, elephants and other animals killed in Africa.

Members of Trump’s advisory board, called the International Wildlife Conservation Council (IWCC), argue that the sport, in which wealthy hunters pay tens of thousands of dollars to shoot endangered megafauna, is a laudable method of conservation abroad.

“This council will be focused on making hunting a better tool for conservation,” said John Jackson III, a member of the IWCC and founder of Conservation Force, an international hunting non-profit. Only two of the council’s 16 members are not active advocates for trophy hunting – the rest belong to groups such as Safari Club International and the National Rifle Association. Instead of discussing whether the sport should be limited, the group is focusing on how to broaden its reach.

Awareness of trophy hunting has increased thanks to social media. In 2015, a Minnesota dentist ignited debate when he shot Cecil, an enormous, black-maned lion immensely popular with camera-wielding tourists and a focus of research. More recently, a Kentucky woman has been criticized for triumphantly posing next to a giraffe she killed; conservationists estimate giraffe populations have fallen 40% since 1990.

Trophy hunters hold immense clout in the Trump administration. The president’s sons, Donald Jr and Eric, frequently hunt in Africa. And the hunting advisory council operates under the auspices of the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, who received $10,000 from the Safari Club during his 2016 congressional campaign. The lopsided composition of the council has critics worried its decisions will protect their chosen pastime, not the animals.

“People who consider themselves conservationists don’t consider trophy hunting conservation,” said Tanya Sanerib, international legal director for the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s an elite, bourgeois activity.”

The US cannot ban its residents from hunting in another nation, but it does regulate the importation of trophies – the body parts of animals killed abroad. Hunters seeking to import the remains of species protected under the Endangered Species Act must provide proof that killing an individual animal broadly enhances the species’ odds of survival.

In 2017, Trump’s interior department eased Obama-era restrictions on trophy hunting, and the president used Twitter to voice displeasure with the practice, writing it was unlikely he would “change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal”. The department then reinstated the ban, but a subsequent court ruling found that it was not based on proper rule-making procedures, and imports continue.

Irrespective of Trump’s comments, the Fish and Wildlife Agency, which oversees trophy imports, holds that well-regulated sport hunting is beneficial to the survival of endangered species. “Most wildlife would cease to exist if it wasn’t for the habitat and the anti-poaching activity” funded by trophy hunters, said Jackson of the IWCC.

The wealthy Americans who hunt abroad say their very presence deters poachers, and their fees keep habitat from being converted to other uses. If a field’s purpose is switched from hunting to cattle grazing, a lion is less a revenue engine than something that might eat one’s livelihood.

Sport hunting’s contribution to species"
91,5,26551,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland – the Batman and Robin of Canadian foreign policy – just got played.

An authoritarian masquerading as the leader of the so-called “free world” just told them, in effect, to buzz off by imposing hefty tariffs on Canadian aluminium and steel imports.

From the outset of Donald Trump‘s vile, racist, and cruel regime, Trudeau and Freeland calculated that if they only mollified the authoritarian at every disgusting turn rather than scold, let alone confront him, then he would reward them with a diplomatic bauble or two.

Now, anyone with even a passing appreciation of Trump’s defining authoritarian nature knew that this Canadian-made “Maple syrup strategy” was destined to fail miserably.

Predictably, the know-it-all realpolitik types in the media and academia approved of the “cool” and “balanced” approach Trudeau and Freeland adopted to try to get Trump to do them a big favour by not putting big tariffs on all sorts of stuff one of the kindest countries in the world exports to its BFF – America.

One Canadian columnist heaped praise on Trudeau’s “calm response” and “balancing act”. “There are sound reasons why Trudeau has taken a deliberate, non-confrontational approach … and so far [he has] managed to stay off his [Trump’s] protectionist radar,” the scribe wrote.

Shortly after penning his ode to Trudeau’s “fine line” diplomacy, the columnist was hired as a senior communications adviser for Canada-US relations in the prime minister’s office.

Not to be outdone in the premature congratulatory department, The New York Times painted Trudeau as a diplomatic Svengali for engineering a never-before-used-end-run around an erratic president by appealing directly to mayors, governors and executives to protect Canada’s trade interests.

“By organizing a grass-roots network of American officials, lawmakers and businesses, Canada is hoping to contain Mr Trump’s protectionist and nationalist impulses,” the NYT correspondent wrote, apparently not realising that Trudeau’s unique bypass-the-president gambit isn’t that unique at all."
92,10,15535,"on3], the statistics governing the random processes are assumed to be available at the transmitter, while their realizations are known only causally. The EH communication system is modeled as a Markov decision process [@on1], and dynamic programming can be used to optimize the throughput numerically. In the learning optimization framework, knowledge about the system behavior is further relaxed and even the statistical knowledge about the random processes governing the system is not assumed, and the optimal policy scheduling is learned over time [@learning]. In this paper we assume that EH nodes have no knowledge about the EH processes, and can only observe the amount of harvested energy in their own battery. Optimal threshold policies for an EH network is considered in [@game] based on a game theoretic approach. In [@dos], authors optimize the throughput of a heterogeneous *ad hoc* EH network by formulating it as an optimal stopping problem. In [@basco2015] multiple energy harvesting sensor nodes are scheduled by an access point which does not know the energy harvesting process and battery states of the nodes. However, in these works the EH processes at different devices are assumed to be independent.

System Model {#sec:SystemModel}
============

We adopt an interference model, where the simultaneous transmissions of two EH nodes result in a collision, and eventual loss of transmitted packets at the base station. Each node is capable of harvesting energy from an ambient resource (solar, wind, vibration, RF, etc.), and storing it in a finite capacity rechargeable battery. EH nodes have no additional power supplies. The nodes are data backlogged, and once they access the channel, they transmit until their battery is completely depleted. Note that assuming that the nodes are always backlogged allows us to obtain the saturated system throughput. In the following, we neglect the energy consumption due to generation of data to better illustrate the effects of correlated EH processes[^2].

Time is slotted into intervals of unit length. In each time slot, the energy is harvested in units of $\delta$ joules. Let $E_{n}(t)$ be the energy harvested in time slot $t$ by node $n=1,2$. We assume that $E_{n}(t)$ is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli process with respect to time $t$. However, at a given time slot $t$, $E_{1}(t)$ and $E_{2}(t)$ may not be independent. The EH rates are defined as follows: $$\begin{aligned}
{\ensuremath{\mathsf{Pr}\left(E_{1}(t)=\delta,E_{2}(t)=\delta\right)}}=p_{11},\nonumber\\ 
{\ensuremath{\mathsf{Pr}\left(E_{1}(t)=\delta,E_{2}(t)=0\right)}}=p_{10}, \nonumber\\

94,29,25887,"A new GAO report raises cost and schedule risks for the Space Launch System that, to opponents of the vehicle, hardly come as a surprise. (credit: NASA) The downhill slide of NASA’s “rocket to nowhere”

As predicted years ago, it appears the beginning of the end has begun for the gigantic rocket and Congressional boondoggle called the Space Launch System (SLS). This launcher is also known by its detractors as the “Rocket to Nowhere” because there are no payloads in development that are large enough to justify a rocket of its size. The GAO report concluded the initial launch date of SLS Block 1 may slip from late 2017 to mid-2018, and mentioned that the slippage is likely to get worse as time goes on. In 2011, NASA administrator Charles Bolden commissioned Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) to do an analysis of the shuttle-derived SLS. This action was taken after it became clear that Congress was determined to implement this hyper-expensive launch vehicle, rather than developing the more economically practical alternative technology needed for deep spaceflight that was specified in NASA’s prior proposal to the legislature in 2010. In one of my earlier articles here (see “Dennis Tito’s ‘Spaceship to Everywhere’ may be a dead-end for NASA”, The Space Review, April 7, 2014), I summarized the BAH report as follows: SLS will probably stay on schedule within its assigned budget for the first three to five years of development. “Beyond this horizon, the inclusion of large expected cost savings in the estimates, the beginning of development activities, and the potential for significant risk events” decreased the confidence of the BAH report’s authors. This situation would result from SLS being restricted to an annual budget of a size that Congress will actually appropriate. It renders meaningless the claim that SLS’s meeting of its current development schedule is an indicator that the rocket is viable, since the total development time to date is still within the five-year window specified in the BAH report. In fact, the report says that after the window period, it is likely the amount of time between the accomplishment of the developmental goals will get stretched further and further apart. It’s possible the initiation of the BAH study was a precautionary move by Bolden. That is, in the likely event that SLS habitually doesn’t meet its timeline goals and Congress looks to use the NASA administrator as a scapegoat, Bolden can point to the report and say he tried to warn them. After all, the Ares I launcher of the earlier Constellation Program met the same fate for similar reasons, while consuming many billions of dollars in the process. Given that almost all of the same disadvantages that hobbled Ares I apply to"

Martha Davison and Mark B. Curry, Jr., individually and on behalf of a class of persons similarly situated (the taxpayers), appeal from a judgment of the district court dismissing their complaint against the Park County Board of Commissioners, the commissioners individually, the county assessor, Valuation Associates, Inc., and certain employees of Valuation. We affirm in part and reverse in part.
The allegations of the complaint indicate that in 1973 the Board entered into various contracts with Valuation. According to the complaint, the contracts provided that Valuation would reappraise the property in Park County, without direction from or supervision by the Park County Assessor, John R. Klein. In 1975, pursuant to the reappraisal, notices of increased valuation were sent to Park County real property owners.
The taxpayers commenced this action seeking, inter alia, (1) a declaration that the contracts between the Board and Valuation were ultra vires and void; (2) a declaration that the notices of increased valuation based upon the subject reappraisals were void; (3) a declaration that the real property taxes, based upon those notices, were void; (4) an abatement or refund of the taxes; and (5) judgment on behalf of the County against the commissioners, Valuation, and Hartford Insurance Co. (as surety on bonds executed by the commissioners) for all sums allegedly misappropriated in the reappraisal program. The State of Colorado, Office of Division of Property Taxation, was joined as a third-party defendant because the commissioners asserted that the reappraisals were performed pursuant to directives from the State.
On motion of Hartford Insurance Co., the trial court granted a summary judgment in its favor on the taxpayers' claim that Hartford was liable for the alleged misappropriation of funds by the commissioners in contracting for the reappraisals by Valuation. During the hearing on Hartford's motion, and pursuant to oral motion, the trial court dismissed the remaining claims asserted in the complaint, and consequently the third-party complaint, ruling, inter alia, that the taxpayers had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.

The sale of his former employer to a publicly-traded company wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for eight years of growth, including a large increase of employees and income.

Todd Katz saw similar successes as a director of mergers and acquisitions at wealth management firms across the country, including his role in helping to earn some $34 million in revenue. It’s crucial for companies on an upward trajectory to keep on that path and it appears Netflix is well aware of this. While 91 Emmy nominations for original in-house content is a pretty good start, the CNBC article notes that programs like “Orange is the New Black” are one of the ways that Netflix is showing subscribers and investors that it takes content creation seriously. Morgan Stanley, a financial services firm, boosted its price for Netflix shares from $185 to $210, according to the CNBC report. According to Todd Katz of Quest Integrity, this is one of the strongest signs of economic health.

According to the Associated Press, the move ends Yahoo’s 21-year stint as a publicly-traded company, sees the ouster of CEO Marissa Mayer with a considerable severance package and could cost approximately 2,00 workers their jobs. What’s more, the email, sports and news departments of Yahoo will now fall under the direction of Tim Armstrong. Armstrong, a top AOL official, will head a department consisting of both AOL and Yahoo services, according to the report. Per the Associated Press, the move on Verizon’s behalf is intended to compete with the digital advertising sector that Google and Facebook are reaping the rewards of.

Animation April: Rock & Rule (1983)

This...this is a weird one.

It's much
weirder than Project A-ko, even though A-ko is a movie about dueling
schoolgirls and men with vaginas directed by a pantyshot-obsessed twentysomething
missing at least two of his incisors. A-ko can't even touch Rock & Rule.

At
least A-ko belongs to a distinct and recognizable clade in the
evolutionary annals of animation. It's an anime from the 1980s, iconic
during its time, and it had a perceptible impact on the cartoons produced
in Japan. For all its screwiness, we can place it. Rock & Rule is an aberration.

It would probably be best grouped with the Bakshi-and-allies aggregate. (Incidentally, bootleg copies of Rock & Rule passed around at conventions erroneously attributed the film to him.) Ralph Bakshi is/was a ballsy chap: he had the then-outlandish idea that feature-length cartoons could be something other than
family-friendly adaptations of children's storybooks, and made a handful of
films during the 1970s and early 1980s that were not, not, not for kids (and he also cast Tolkien onto the silver screen
decades before Peter Jackson). Other Western animation studios took
notice, and followed Bakshi's example in pushing the envelope in which
Disney had sealed the industry for almost half a century. Watership Down (1978) and The Last Unicorn
(1982) were a couple of films about rabbits and a magical horsey
marketed to general audiences—but everyone I know who watched them as
youngsters walked away seriously rattled. (Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club wrote a very nice piece about The Last Unicorn and how it once scared the hell out of him.) Oppositely there was Heavy Metal (1981), brimming with graphic violence, exposed breasts, and lurid juvenility, and inappropriate for anyone but seventeen-year-old males.

And there was also Rock & Rule, but nobody noticed.

Rock
& Rule was the second feature-length animated film to be produced
in Canada, and the first in the English language. The studio responsible
was Nelvana: someone my age might remember its ursine logo from the
credits of kids' shows like Inspector Gadget (1983), Beetlejuice (1989), and Eek! the"
99,23,4000,"1. Technical Field
The present invention relates generally to a flanged support structure that retains various pipeline control mechanisms without housing them in a pressurized “mother-valve” or fluid-retaining container during their useful life. This structure can support a pipeline control mechanism such as a directional-flow mechanism, an orifice plate/conduit-spacer and/or a protection-screen in fluid-tight arrangement in lines carrying water, sewer, natural gas, or other fluids. The present flange structure can allow such pipeline control mechanisms to be replaced under pressure without first shutting down the line. If a line can be easily depressurized or shut down, this assembly can also aid in quick removal and installation of a pipeline control mechanism by hand.
2. Description of Related Art
A typical repair valve is not a flanged structure that can allow depressurization of the structure surrounding an internal valve. Existing U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,908,691 and 6,983,759 for example provide a “mother-valve” completely encompassing and containing a repairable or removable valve which is submerged in the pipeline fluid during its entire useful life. The valve can include a one-piece manufactured structure to provide a hollow through-passage or hollow interior that extends between first and second ends of the housing of the valve. The first and second ends are threaded, flanged, grooved, weld-ended or otherwise configured so that a user can readily connect each end to a respective one of separate first and second pipeline sections, either directly or via intermediate fittings.
The container that houses the replaceable valve cartridge is built in a way similar to a typical valve, but being a “mother-valve” it encompasses in its pocket a removable internal valve and incorporates features that allow an adaptable isolation gate to perform removal of the pipeline control mechanisms without disruption of system or the pressure from within the pressurized container. More specifically, part of the structure defines an opening that provides access to the pressurized cavity of the “mother-valve” interior. A pipeline control mechanism is removably mounted within that opening in fluid-tight engagement with the “mother-valve” structure. There it functions as means for enabling the user to selectively stop and unstop fluid communications between the first and second pipeline sections.
Known repairable valves cannot easily use off-the-shelf pipeline control mechanisms, actuators and levers without providing complicated fluid-tight seals between the “mother-valve” and the pipeline control mechanism because they are pressurized together. The pipeline control mechanism will either require a custom built bonneted product produced to fit the “mother-valve” or a pressure cover plate that requires a stem packing so a custom extension can be used to operate the pipeline control mechanism within the “mother-valve” and can be operated externally.
Regardless of the particular style of known repair valves, all past mechanisms use a completely pressurized container similar to a bowl in shape to hold the pipeline control mechanism where both are pressurized. This container or valve body remains flooded during its lifetime and cannot be completely depressurized to be cleaned out because the system is fully pressurized at all times.
Corrosion is caused by the existing “mother-valve” being filled with pipeline fluid during its useful life. This body holds particles as well, encouraging corrosion to eat away at the valve body fairly quickly. When a pipeline control mechanism is removed from a “mother-valve”, debris falls into the cavity between the pipeline control mechanism and the “mother-valve,” and upon reinstallation of the pipeline control mechanism the particles can impede proper sealing of the pipeline control mechanism to the “mother-valve”.
Left over particles and corrosion can hinder proper seating of the pipeline control mechanism to the “mother-valve” and make it difficult to replace pipeline control mechanisms under pressure in a fluid-tight manner.
Some pipeline systems can be out of service for short periods of time but then need to be on line again without delay. In that event, when the system can be shut down easily for a few minutes to make repairs or change valves, quick change valves will often leave debris in the “mother-valve.”
Another common problem with known repair valves relates to the procedure of hot tapping. This known operation leaves behind many cuttings or chips created by a hole-saw cutting its way through an existing pipeline and depositing many cuttings within the pressurized vessel. Shavings from the hot tapping operation remain within the pressurized interior of the repair valve cavity especially between the pipeline control mechanism and the �"

.SH ""NAME""
\fBnpm-registry\fR \- The JavaScript Package Registry
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
To resolve packages by name and version, npm talks to a registry website
that implements the CommonJS Package Registry specification for reading
package info\.
.P
Additionally, npm's package registry implementation supports several
write APIs as well, to allow for publishing packages and managing user
account information\.
.P
The official public npm registry is at https://registry\.npmjs\.org/\|\.  It
is powered by a CouchDB database, of which there is a public mirror at
https://skimdb\.npmjs\.com/registry\|\.  The code for the couchapp is
available at https://github\.com/npm/npm\-registry\-couchapp\|\.
.P
The registry URL used is determined by the scope of the package (see
npm help 7 \fBnpm\-scope\fP)\. If no scope is specified, the default registry is used, which is
supplied by the \fBregistry\fP config parameter\.  See npm help \fBnpm\-config\fP,
npm help 5 \fBnpmrc\fP, and npm help 7 \fBnpm\-config\fP for more on managing npm's configuration\.
.SH Does npm send any information about me back to the registry?
.P
Yes\.
.P
When making requests of the registry npm adds two headers with information
about your environment:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNpm\-Scope\fP – If your project is scoped, this header will contain its
scope\. In the future npm hopes to build registry features that use this
information to allow you to customize your experience for your
organization\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNpm\-In\-CI\fP – Set to ""true"" if npm believes this install is running in a
continous integration environment, ""false"" otherwise\. This is detected by
looking for the following environment variables: \fBCI\fP, \fBTDDIUM\fP,
\fBJENKINS_URL\fP, \fBbamboo\.buildKey\fP\|\. If you'd like to learn more you may find
the original PR \fIhttps://github\.com/npm/npm\-registry\-client/pull/129\fR
interesting\.
This is used to gather better metrics on how npm is used by humans, versus
build farms\.

.RE
.P
The npm registry does not try to correlate the information in these headers
with any authenticated accounts that may be used in the same requests\.
.SH Can I run my own private registry?
.P
Yes!
.P
The easiest way is to replicate the couch database, and use the same (or
similar) design doc to implement the APIs\.
.P
If you set up continuous replication from the official CouchDB, and then
set your internal CouchDB as the registry config, then you'll be able
to read any published packages, in addition to your private ones, and by
default will only publish internally\. 
.P
If you then want to publish a package for the whole world to see, you can
simply override the \fB\-\-registry\fP option for that \fBpublish\fP command\.
.SH I don't want my package published in the official registry\. It's private\.
.P
Set \fB""private"": true\fP in your package\.json to prevent it from being
published at all, or
\fB""publishConfig"":{""registry"":""http://my\-internal\-registry\.local""}\fP
to force it to be published only to your internal registry\.
.P
See npm help 5 \fBpackage\.json\fP for more info on what goes in the package\.json file\.
.SH Will you replicate from my registry into the public one?
.P
No\.  If you want things to be public, then publish them into the public
registry using npm\.  What little security there is would be for nought
otherwise\.
.SH Do I have to use couchdb to build a registry that npm can talk to?
.P
No"
101,13,13300," education for the path it has taken regarding specialization. According to Hutchins in his essay, ""The Idea of a College,"" the specialization of American education has robbed students of the ability to communicate with other students outside of their field. He argues that a student of biology cannot converse meaningfully with a student of mathematics because they share no common educational experience.

In The University of Utopia, Hutchins outlines the educational experience of young Utopians, where the first ten years of instruction prepare students for the learning experiences to come. Communication is the primary skill developed. Students learn to read, write, and discuss issues in preparation for their future lifetime of learning. Students study science and mathematics, which form part of the groundwork for future learning. History, geography, and literature are also studied to add to the framework for even deeper learning later in life. Finally, art and music are studied because these are considered the elements that make society great.

Throughout these fields of study in Utopia, the Great Books, those books that shaped Western thought, are used as study material and are discussed by classes using the Socratic method. The Socratic method, named for Socrates and his method of teaching, involves the teacher's keeping the discussion on topic and guiding it away from errors of logic. In a discussion conducted in accordance with Socratic principles, unexamined opinions are fair game, and only reason itself is the final arbiter. Thus, any conclusions reached in such a discussion are the individual's own, not necessarily those of a class consensus, and certainly not necessarily the teacher's. The Great Books are a natural choice, since they are considered to be works of genius, timeless, and ever relevant to society. Why settle for lesser materials when you can have the best? Despite his other foci, Hutchins does not entirely shun the laboratory world; he believes, however, that some such things are best learned through discovery once a student has been graduated to the outside world.

In Utopia, initial schooling is followed by college, which continues the study of a highly prescribed curriculum. Here, however, the focus shifts from learning the techniques of communication to exploring some of man's principal concepts of the world and the leading ideas that have propelled mankind. After college, students sit for an extensive exam created by an outside board, which reflects what an education appropriate to a free person should be. This rigorous exam is similar to those taken throughout a student's education but is more comprehensive. When the student passes this exam, he or she is awarded a Bachelor of Arts Degree. The degree is conferred based on the mastery of this information, not on the number of classes taken, credits earned, or hours spent in class.

After proving that they have the necessary education to become a part of the republic of learning and of the political republic, the student may enter the work world or continue his or her formal education at the University. Once departing from formal education, a lifetime of learning follows for the citizens of Utopia. They visit centers of learning to explore and discuss ideas and analyze great works. These centers of learning are residential institutions where citizens go during what Americans would traditionally think of as vacation time. If they choose to matriculate to University, students begin to specialize, but they do not study collection of data, technical training, or solutions to immediate practical problems, but rather they explore the intellectual ideas specific to their chosen field. Here, students study in much less formal situations but with no less vigor. During their initial schooling and college, students had to prove that they could learn independently; if they then chose to attend a University, they were expected to make effective use of those skills.

In addition to Hutchins's belief that school should pursue intellectual ideas rather than practical, he also believed that schools should not teach a specific set of values. ""It is not the object of a college to make its students good, because the college cannot do it; if it tries to do it, it will fail; it will weaken the agencies that should be discharging this responsibility, and it will not discharge its own responsibility."" The schools should not be in the business of teaching students what is right and just; it should be in the business of helping students make their own determinations.

“

When young people are asked, ""What are you interested in?"" they answer that they are interested in justice: they want justice for the Negro, they want justice for the Third World. If you say, ""Well, what is justice?"" they haven't any idea.

The temperature dependence could be explained by the hydrophobic interactions and presence of the fusion partner. At low temperature, the hydrophobic interactions become weaker which allows the protein to form the correct intramolecular contacts and adopt the native fold. The fusion partner, like thioredoxin, can conceal the hydrophobic areas on the RIP2CARD surface, which does not allow the oligomers formation.

Thus, we showed that a soluble form of RIP2CARD can be obtained with the fusion partner, but no more than 15 mg of the target protein (RIP2CARD) per liter of medium, while the total yield can reach 30--40 mg per liter. In addition, even these reduced amounts of soluble chimeric proteins were unstable and precipitated after the first purification step by IMAC. In this regard, we decided to develop a protein refolding procedure from the inclusion bodies.

Refolding protocol for RIP2CARD from the inclusion bodies {#sec008}
---------------------------------------------------------

The refolding procedure appears to be one of the major bottlenecks in getting the natively structured and active recombinant protein. In the case of RIP2CARD, the refolding is aimed to eliminate the strong solvents from the previous step of production protocol. To refold the purified RIP2CARD, we employed two most widely used and efficient approaches: dialysis and dilution. Theoretical isoelectric point of RIP2CARD protein is 8.8, therefore we carried out the refolding process at pH below the pI value. We tested several protocols for the specified pH range. Our first attempts included the straightway dialysis at ""native"" pH (7.5--8.5). Under these conditions, we observed the intense protein aggregation. The concentration of RIP2CARD after dialysis was below 0.5 mg/ml and could not be increased by any kind of the concentrating procedure. To make the refolding even more gradual, we tried the stepwise dialysis approach, reducing the amount of urea in the dialysis buffer every 12--18 hours (6 M, 4 M, 2 M, and without urea). At last two steps of the buffer switch (2 M and without urea), the protein aggregation was detected. Since the protein folding may be affected by the protein-protein interactions, induced by the high concentration, we applied several approaches to avoid the aggregation: addition of arginine and slight dilution prior to the dialysis. Arginine is known to suppress the protein aggregation and improve the refolding yields \[["

106,13,24309,"Manager’s assumption of pending retirement leads to age discrimination

A federal government employee has been awarded $25,000 for age discrimination after she was denied a chance to take advantage of a retirement incentive by giving her job to another employee under a workforce adjustment directive.

Diane Legros, 67, worked as a senior policy analyst at the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). In the federal public service since 1989, she joined CBSA in 2011 through a staffing process.

In the 2011-12 fiscal year, the federal government implemented a deficit reduction action plan that required all public service agencies to reduce staff and government spending. Part of the plan involved a “workforce adjustment directive” to maximize employment opportunities for any public servants who wanted to remain in the public service but had their jobs eliminated by finding alternative employment whenever possible.

In addition, employees who were close to retirement were given an incentive — a cash payment based on years of service — if they gave up their positions to employees whose jobs were being cut. This directive was incorporated into the government’s various collective agreements. Any employee wishing to leave the public service could post his position on a government website — the process was called alternation — and management would decide if anyone applying was suitable.

In 2012, Legros was 62 years old but she wasn’t prepared to retire because she had taken extended medical leave from 2006 to 2009, during which she had lost income and incurred medical expenses. So Legros was interested in the incentive because the cash payment could allow her to retire.

However, Legros’ manager refused her request as it had been decided Legros’ position could be eliminated as part of the cost-cutting since Legros was likely close to retirement.

But Legros felt her position was too important to be eliminated,"

Pol ι expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in human ESCC {#s2_1}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our previous studies demonstrated that Pol ι is highly expressed in ESCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues \[[@R22]\]. To further confirm this observation, the expression of *Pol ι* mRNA was examined with qRT-PCR in an expanded cohort of 82 ESCC tissue samples and 60 matched adjacent normal esophageal tissue samples. As shown in Figure [1A and 1B](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}, Pol ι expression was significantly increased in ESCC tissues (63.3%) compared with adjacent normal esophageal tissues (*p*\<0.001). Lymph node metastasis has been characterized as the single most important prognostic factor for esophageal cancer \[[@R23]\]. Our results revealed that the expression of Pol ι is significantly higher in ESCCs with lymph node metastasis than those without lymph node metastasis (*p*\<0.01, Figure [1D](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}), although the expression level is not correlated with T stages (*p*\>0.05, Figure [1C](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}).

![Pol ι expression is frequently increased in human ESCC\
**A-B.** Pol ι expression was examined by qRT-PCR in 82 ESCC tissue samples and 60 matched adjacent normal esophageal tissue samples. Pol ι expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues compared with that in adjacent normal esophageal tissues (\*\*\**p*\<0.001, Student\'s t test). **C-D.** The correlation between Pol ι expression and T stages (C, *p*\>0.05) or lymph node metastasis (D \*\**p*\<0.01, Student\'s t test). **E-F.** MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression were examined by qRT-PCR in 82 ESCC tissue samples, and Pol ι expression was positively correlated with the MMP-2 (*p*\<0.05, Pearson\'s correlation) or MMP-9 expression (*p*\<0.01, Pearson\'s correlation).](oncotarget-07-32274-g001){#F1}

The increased expression of MMPs is necessary for tumor invasion and metastasis due to their role in degrading the cell-extracellular matrix. Our previous investigation showed that there seems to be no relationship between *Pol ι* and *MMP* expression in tumor tissues, based on a relatively small cohort \[[@R22]\]. However, when we compared the expression levels of *Pol ι* and *MMP-2/9* in ESCC using a larger clinical sample size (n=82), the results showed that the expression levels of *Pol* ι and *MMP-2/9* are positively correlated in ESCC (*p*\<0.05, Figure [1E and 1F](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}). These results suggest that Pol ι may promote tumor progression through enhancing ESCC invasion and metastasis.

We next analyzed Pol ι protein expression in 170 ESCC patients by immunohistochemical assay. Immunohistochemical staining combined with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the patients with higher Pol ι expression in ESCC tissues has poorer clinical outcomes (*p*=0.031; Figure [2A and 2B](#F2){ref-type=""fig""}), indicating that Pol ι protein expression is positively associated with tumor progression of ESCC

“Uh… could I get a Diet Coke with lemon?” His gaze narrowed at my non-alcoholic order, and he took in my fresh face and wondered what I was doing there. I didn’t fit in with the usual clientele… at all. I smiled and continued, “Or lime… whatever one’s easier will work, since I like them both.”

His lips drew into a thin line before he shook his head and left to get my drink. From his thoughts, I picked up that he’d noticed me the moment I’d come in and correctly determined that I had no idea what I was doing there. I had to be meeting someone. But who was it, and what did I want with them?

He knew I wasn’t a cop, since a cop would know better than to come in here alone. And even though I tried to pull off the bad-ass look with a motorcycle jacket and boots, I should have at least tried to cover my blond hair to fit in better. Then he hoped I didn’t cause any trouble, because he had a feeling I was in way over my head.

With his instincts on high alert, he glanced over at Big Kahuna’s booth, and his lips twisted with dismay. It was too late. Now I was in for it.

Alarmed, I followed his gaze to a huge man who straightened from a slouch in his booth across from the bar. He observed me with narrowed eyes like a wild tiger scenting its prey. I swallowed and noticed several more guys like him throughout the place, all of Polynesian descent. What had I stumbled into now?

At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ ruled that Gonzalez was deportable as charged in the OSC, and ineligible for asylum and voluntary departure.  The IJ also ruled that, whether or not Gonzalez was a legal permanent resident, he would be ineligible for section 212(c) relief because he had not accrued the requisite seven years of consecutive residence.


14
On May 18, 1994, the BIA dismissed Gonzalez's appeal and denied his motion to remand.  The BIA ruled, inter alia, that Gonzalez's hearing had not been unfair because;  (1) his initial hearing had been held in October and, thus, he had had three months to obtain counsel;  (2) he did not request a continuance in order to obtain counsel or for any other reason;  (3) no prejudice resulted from the IJ's going forward with the January 25, 1994 hearing, because the IJ properly found him to be deportable as charged, ineligible for asylum or voluntary departure, and unable to apply for section 212(c) relief.

On June 6, 1994, Gonzalez filed a timely petition for review with this court.

On July 26, 1994, Gonzalez moved the BIA to reopen its decision of May 18, 1994, contending that while his petition for review was pending in this court, he had become eligible for section 212(c) relief.  On October 11, 1994, the BIA denied Gonzalez's motion to reopen.

Denial of Right to Counsel

Gonzalez contends that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ's finding of deportability because the IJ denied him his right to counsel by:  (1) failing to advise him of this right, as required by 8 C.F.R. Sec. 242.16(a);  and (2) allowing him to proceed pro se without (a) ascertaining whether he wished to waive his right to counsel, and (b) informing him of his right to request a continuance.

114,3,2861,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has increased the marginal tax rate on high net worth individuals (HNIs) from about 35 percent till now to 42.7 percent.

""Marginal"" rate of 42.7 percent means that the taxpayer will have to pay income tax of 42.7 paise out of every Rs 1 rupee earned by him or her above an income of Rs 5 crore. On the face, this is a step in the right direction.

The rich earn money from the country and they have a greater responsibility towards our people. However, globalisation has created a totally different dynamics of taxation because the HNIs can migrate to other countries where the tax rates are less.

They can continue to do business in India as ""foreign"" nationals. Say a person had invested Rs 100 crores in a business and making a profit of Rs 6 crores per year. He would have to pay an Income Tax of Rs 2.49 crores as an Indian national as per the new rates announced by the Finance Minister.

Now let us say, he migrates to Abu Dhabi, pulls out his investment from India, then sends that money back to India as ""Foreign Investment"" and continues to run his business as previously.

But now the income earned by him in India will be taxed in Abu Dhabi. The catch is that the Income Tax in Abu Dhabi is zero. Therefore, if you become an Abu Dhabi citizen, you do not have to pay tax on your income in India.

The rate is lower if not zero in most developed countries. The marginal rate of Income Tax is 30 percent in the United States of America.

These lower-than-India tax rates provide a huge incentive for HNIs to migrate out of India. According to one report, about 5,000 HNIs have been migrating every year from India.

These HNIs are taking their wealth with them. Once abroad, they have less incentive to invest in India. In this way, the high tax rates will harm investments in the Indian economy.

T V Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education says: ""Tax terrorism is the foremost cause of millionaire exodus. Most of those who have left were from Mumbai and Delhi… said tax harassment had peaked; so much so that it had created a fear psychosis among them.""

The other grouse is the deteriorating quality of life in India. The HNIs say that air quality, traffic condition and other parameters of good living environment have gone from bad to worse over years, says Pai.

The bullet train is leading to cutting of large numbers of mangroves; the National Waterway Project on the Ganga is leading to killing of dolphins and turtles; forests in the Aravallis are being cut for housing projects...

The list goes on and on. The result of these ""development"" activities is that the quality of life has deteriorated and HNIs are migrating.

A friend of mine was living in Delhi. His wife's weight came down from 45 kilo to 22 kilo. Then he migrated to Dehradun. Her weight came back without requiring any medications. The same with HNIs.

The third reason for migration of HNIs is that they are looking at investing and building assets overseas. The best way to do this is to become an overseas resident, says Pai.

The economic growth is down in India and there are few investment opportunities. For these reasons, the raising of Income Tax rate will only lead to an exodus of HNIs from India and boomerang as lower collections of Income Tax, lower investments and lower rates of GDP growth.

It is impossible to sustain high Income Tax rates once we have opened our economy to global capital flows. Today every country is reducing the tax rates to attract HNIs. To increase tax rates in this scenario will be suicidal.

The Finance Minister, however, rightly said that the HNIs must contribute more to the building of the economy. The question is how? I have three suggestions to make.

First, the Finance Minister must tax luxury consumption — especially that which adds to pollution and deterioration of quality of life. For example, we could have a ""progressive"" pricing of petrol. Those buying more than 5 liters could be charged a higher price.

The electricity charges could be made much more progressive. The electricity price in UP, for example, is Rs 4.90 per unit for first 150 units while above 500 units the rates are Rs 6.50 per unit. The upper rates could be raised to, say, Rs 15 per unit.

Luxury consumption goods like chocolates and sodas could be taxed heavily. Polluting goods like plastic bags could also be taxed heavily.

The HNIs would barely notice these taxes but the"

Thirty seconds was the difference in whether a young girl survived a “nightmarish” rape at knife point, said family members of the victim, whose attacker was sentenced to up to 99 years in prison Thursday in Oakland County Circuit Court.

The Highland Township teen who pleaded no contest to the assault, 17-year-old Brandon Markes, stood silent as the victim’s mother addressed the court. He was sentenced to a minimum of 21 years and nine months by Oakland County Circuit Judge Michael Warren.

“Thirty seconds is the time she had left to live before he let her go. He approached her while she was alone... raped her at knife point and almost choked her to death while she begged for her life.

At 6 feet 3 and 270 pounds, there are not many things that put fear into former New Orleans Saints Pro Bowl offensive guard Steve Korte.

But with each passing obituary, he begins to grow increasingly nervous, if not downright scared.

Ellis Lucia/The Times-PicayuneFormer New Orleans Saints defensive lineman Norman Hand's death has shook up some former players.

In the wake of the death of former Saints defensive tackle Norman Hand, who died May 14 of heart disease at the age of 37 in South Carolina, Korte said he's concerned about the life expectancy of not just himself but of current and former NFL linemen, who typically are larger than 300 pounds.

""If you think about it there are not very many great big old men,"" Korte said.

While Hand's death may have sounded the latest alarm, there has been warning signs for years, as the list of former NFL linemen who have died because of heart conditions or undetermined causes is growing.

The Saints certainly have had their share of tragedies.

In recent years several former Saints lineman have died from heart or weight-related issues, including Steve Trapilo, who was 39; Frank Warren, who was 39; and Tony Elliot, who was 48.

According to several studies, football linemen, who are typically classified as obese, have higher risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

""It is alarming in general when you realize what the consequences are to a lot of guys who played the game,"" said former Saints guard Brad Edelman, who has dropped nearly 40 pounds from his playing days and weighs 245 pounds. ""On a personal level I'm not aware of having any conditions like that and my weight has not been an issue. But certainly it's an issue that a lot of guys need to be concerned about.

123,24,9500,"As the world watched the civilian death toll in Gaza climb over the weekend, the international response was largely built on three pillars.

Most capitals emphasized Israel’s right to defend itself, the need to protect innocent civilians and the need for a mutual ceasefire.

But in Canada, the tone and the message were different.

Israel had not just the right to defend itself, but the obligation, according to Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird.

The end to the conflict was the responsibility of Hamas, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said.

And neither man expressed much in the way of optimism for a cessation of hostilities or concern for the number of civilians who have perished under the Israeli bombardment, a number which could be three out of every four of the more than 160 killed so far in the Gaza.

Harper, in fact, issued a statement Sunday that made only scant reference to civilian deaths.

“It is evident that Hamas is deliberately using human shields to further terror in the region,’’ he said.

Baird mentioned nothing of this in a media briefing Friday, but did so in a statement Saturday scolding the United Nations for calling for Israeli restraint. He, too, placed the blame on Hamas.

“Canada mourns the death and suffering of innocent civilians in Gaza. Responsibility rests solely with Hamas and its allies, who launched and continue to feed this crisis,’’ he said.

The Harper government clearly believes Hamas is now so badly wounded that the Israeli offensive should continue until the terrorist organization is massively degraded, if not eliminated.

Harper’s “unequivocal” support for Israel will surprise no one here or abroad and Baird’s aggressive pushback against the United Nations has also lost its ability to surprise.

Baird is correct when he says there is no moral equivalency between a democratic state and a terrorist organization, and that Hamas militants are hiding within its civilian population is abominable.

Except that the population of Gaza is so tightly constricted, the innocents really have nowhere to run.

Israel says Hamas leaders are sending civilians back into homes, even after warnings of impending strikes, warnings delivered with either a rocket, a so-called “knock on the roof,” or a phone call.

But in some instances, death came without a calling card.

An Israeli air strike that destroyed the home of a cousin of the Gaza police chief and a neighbouring mosque came without warning, residents said. It killed 18, including children, and wounded 50.

There had been a knock on the roof at the home for those with mental and physical challenges, but staff ignored it, so certain were they that they could not possibly be on the Israeli hit list.

The attack killed two residents and wounded three.

Canada’s two opposition parties have been more circumspect, but neither was eager to take on Ottawa’s official position and that may mark a sea change in the country’s Middle East position which is less and less a Conservative position and increasingly an all-party consensus.

Both Liberal foreign affairs critic Marc Garneau and his NDP counterpart Paul Dewar preached restraint, de-escalation and protection of civilians.

One Liberal MP who is in Tel Aviv, Newfoundland’s Gerry Byrne, watched Israel’s Iron Dome repel an attack, then took to social media to praise the courage of individual Israelis in the face of terrorism.

Internationally, the tone was more measured than the end-game message from Ottawa.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said, while Israel has the right to defend itself, the world has “deep concern” over civilian casualties and the entire world wanted to see a de-escalation.

Germany’s foreign minister is expected in Israel Monday for talks with the Israelis and the Palestinians. France has also signalled it will help broker"

In July 2007 David joined the newly established English Whisky Company, training with head distiller Iain Henderson, formerly of Laphroaig, until his retirement later in the year. Since then, David has overseen the growth of The English Whisky Company from being a newcomer in the industry to becoming a respected producer. His work with cask management has led to their development of a number of interestingly finished and matured whiskies, and sneak peeks into their warehouses show that they have a lot more up their sleeves.

Eddie MacAffer

Born in his grandmother’s house in the village of Bowmore on Islay, Edward ‘Eddie’ MacAffer began his career at Bowmore in July 1966, aged just 18 years old. He has since had one of the most enduring and successful careers in Islay’s Scotch whisky history.

Before this, Eddie joined the Merchant Navy in 1965, sailing between Greenock, Jamaica and British Guyana with cargoes of sugar. Following the British Seaman’s strike in 1966, Eddie returned to Islay and asked James McColl, then manager of Bowmore Distillery, for a position at the distillery. He started work in the warehouses.

Working in almost every department of the distillery since then, from the malt barns to the stillhouse, Eddie has dedicated his life to producing excellent whiskies.

His passion saw the distillery set a precedent for the procurement of top quality casks for maturation. This included Oloroso casks from Jerez, Spain which would eventually become a milestone in the story of one of the most collectable whiskies of all time – Black Bowmore. Arriving at Bowmore just two years after the iconic casks were laid down for maturation, Eddie has been an integral part of the Black Bowmore series from its infancy and will be pouring the second edition during his masterclass at The Whisky Show.

129,2,29798,"Structures, such as aircraft, civil structures and other large structures, may be built from assemblies, which in turn may be built from subassemblies. In such structures transmitting large loads between one assembly and an adjacent assembly or subassembly is often necessary. For example, one semi-span of an aircraft wing may be attached to a structure on the fuselage. As the wing bends upward due to upward air loads acting upon the wing, compression stress is caused in the upper wing surface and tension loads are created in the lower wing surface. At the root of the wing where the wing attaches to the aircraft fuselage or another semi-span depending on the wing design, transferring the large compression or tension loads from one structure to another may be necessary. Transferring tension loads are more challenging than compression loads for reasons described herein. Structural details or mechanical devices that are often used to transmit these loads are typically referred to as tension clips or tension fittings. Examples of different types of such fittings are illustrated in FIGS. 1-4. The dimensions of the various components of such fittings may vary widely. The different types of fittings may include similar components as described herein. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an example of a prior art angle clip 100 useable in connecting structures. The angle clip 100 may include an end pad 102. The end pad 102 may include an opening 104 formed therein for receiving a fastener 106, such as a bolt or other type fastener. The fastener 106 may include a shank 109 and a head 110. Opening 104 is sized to prevent the head 110 of the fastener 106 from passing through the opening 104. The end pad 102 may be a plate that carries the fastener load to any adjoining walls by shear and bending forces or loads similar to those illustrated in FIG. 2B. Typically, the end pad 102 is substantially quadrilateral in shape, for example substantially rectangular.
The fastener 106 or bolt may connect the angle clip 100 or other fitting to a mating fitting on an adjacent structure. The angle clip 100 or other fitting may abut a mating fitting on the adjacent structure. An example of a fitting abutting a mating fitting that is attached to an adjacent structure is illustrated in FIG. 14.
All tension clips and fittings described herein have certain features in common related to how they transmit tension loads between two structures: Tension loads are transmitted to a fitting from one structure through the fitting's walls attached (or integral) to that structure and these loads are transmitted to another structure via a tension fastener (or fasteners). FIG. 2B illustrates tension forces acting on the side walls and tension fastener shank 109 of a channel tension clip. Thus, for a pair of mating fittings, highly loaded such that the end pads bend and the side walls between the two adjoining fittings separate from each other, the load path can be described as follows: tension load travels from a structure into the side walls of one fitting to the end pad of that fitting, through the tension bolt into the end pad of the adjoining fitting, and then to the side walls of the that adjoining fitting, and then to the adjoining structure.
The angle clip 100 may include an adjoining wall or side wall 108 that may project substantially perpendicular to the end pad 102 and substantially parallel to an axis of the fastener 106 or bolt. A fitting including three of the four sides of a quadrilateral end pad 102 having adjoining side walls is referred to as a channel fitting. An example of a channel fitting 400 including three adjoining side walls 402, 404 and 406 is illustrated in FIG. 4. The side wall 406 of a channel fitting is also referred to as a back plane. If only two sides that meet in a common corner are joined to the end pad 102, the fitting is termed an angle fitting. An example of an angle fitting 300 including two adjacent joining side walls 302 and 304 is illustrated in FIG. 3. If only one of the sides of the quadrilateral is joined to a side wall, the fitting is termed an angle clip 100 as illustrated in FIG. 1. If two opposite sides of the quadrilateral end pad 102 are each joined to a side wall 202 and 204, the fitting is termed a channel tension clip. An example of a channel tension clip 200 is illustrated in FIG. 2A with the two opposite side walls 202 and 204.
On a weight efficiency basis, channel tension fittings are more efficient than channel fittings, which in turn are more efficient than angle fittings, which in turn, are more efficient than channel or angle clips. While machining cost does influence the design of channel fittings and channel tension clips, minimizing weight of any structural components of an aircraft or structure to be used in outer space is highly desirable. This is because, over the life of the structure, each unit of weight for each part of the vehicle represents a very large amount of fuel with an associated cost. Since the weight savings allows the total vehicle weight to be reduced, there may"

132,26,9565,"Gulf of Finland campaign

The Gulf of Finland U-boat campaign lasted in the Gulf of Finland during the World War II against the Soviet Union between summer 1944 and spring 1945. During the campaign Finland switched sides and joined the Allies.

Background  
The Baltic Sea proved a difficult theatre of operation for submarines as experienced by Soviets during the Soviet submarine Baltic Sea campaign in 1942 and during the failed operation in 1943. The German command dispatched the following units in Kotka from the end of June to operate against the local Soviet shipping in the Gulf: U-481, U-748, U-1193, U-242, U-250, U-348, U-370, U-475, U-479, U-679, U-717, U-745, U-1001.

Main campaign 
German operations until Moscow Armistice when Finland joined Side with Allies.

On 15 July 1944, U-679 was attacked by small Soviet boats: during a gunnery battle, the motor torpedo boat TK-57 suffered damages and two of her torpedoes barely missed the submarine. U-679 fled under cover of Finnish ground artillery.

On 18 July 1944, U-479 damaged the Soviet submarine chaser MO-304 (later repaired).

On 28 July 1944, U-475 damaged the Soviet submarine chaser MO-107

On 30 July 1944, U-481 attacked a group of small Soviet minesweepers, sinking KT-804 and KT-807 while KT-806 was damaged. On the same day U-250 sunk the Soviet submarine chaser MO-105 but was then chased by other units until she sunk by depth charges launched by MO-103. 6 crewmember of U-250, including the captain, were captured by Soviet and the submarine sunk at low depth: Soviet divers worked to collect intelligence despite Axis attempts to prevent it (with mines, depth-charging the wreck and artillery shelling). Despite the efforts, Soviets managed to raise and recover the wreck, acquiring secret documents, an ENIGMA machine and the new acoustic G7es torpedo, gaining the interest of the Royal Navy that asked (and failed) to obtain one of the torpedoes.

On 31 July 1944, U-379 sunk the Soviet submarine chaser MO-101.

On 25 August 1944, U-242 sunk the Soviet survey vessel KKO-2 (600 tons) that was lost together the towed barge VRD-96 Del'fin (500 tons.

On 26 August 1944, U-745 sunk the Soviet auxiliary minesweeper T-45.

Finland joins the Allies 
After Finland Joined the Allies, The Germans lost their base at Kotka and Finnish Navy laid other mine fields after Soviet directions.

On 15 October 1944, U-481 sunk with gunfire the Finnish fishing boats Dan, Endla and Maria.

On 17 October 1944, U-1165 sunk the Soviet submarine chaser BMO-512. Soviets believed she was sunk by mine.

On 24 October 1944, U-958 sunk the Finnish fishing boat Linnea and damaged Piikkiö

On 28 October 1944, on a mine laid by U-242 was sunk the Finnish merchant Rigel (1495 GRT). She was the only proper merchant ship sunk by U-boats during this campaign.

On 29 October 1944, U-958 sunk the Soviet landing craft SB-2 (720 tons). The ship was carrying military equipment, supplies and guns and was heading to Saarenmaa for the Moonsund Landing Operation.

On 18 November 1944, U-679 sunk the Soviet patrol boat SK-62.

As much as teams try to make the draft a science, much of it remains art with too many variables to possibly control. Even at their best, the Ravens never batted 1.000 in the draft, so there will always be picks to critique as many are doing now.

The real problem isn’t passing on these aforementioned players, but it’s that the Ravens haven’t been making enough great picks of their own in recent years to make these second-guessing exercises a moot point. At the macro level, it’s more than fair to argue that the Ravens have too frequently played it safe, relied on quantity over quality, and possibly even conformed with too much groupthink in recent drafts.

Sometimes you have to take a risk to come away with a truly great playmaker or two, which is something the Ravens desperately need on the offensive side of the ball and have for a long time now. You also can’t allow a failed pick like Breshad Perriman deter you from being bold when appropriate.

It’s not a secret that the organization has slanted much more toward defense with 13 of their 17 Day 1 and 2 picks since Super Bowl XLVII being on that side of the ball. That’s enough of a lopsided ratio to make you question whether the Ravens are valuing defensive players too much in favor of truly picking “the best player available” when on the clock.

Their recent drafts haven’t been as disastrous as some want to claim — the Ravens have still found plenty of good value in the latter half of drafts despite recent Day 1 and 2 problems — but they’ve merely been much more ordinary after years of the draft being considered a major advantage for Newsome and the Ravens over other teams.

Even if many of the decisions appeared sound at the time, the sum of the parts has still added up to too much mediocrity, the same place the Ravens are trying to escape.

Comments Off on Some draft criticism unfair, but sum of parts still not adding up for Ravens

We’re a couple days away from the paralysis by analysis finally coming to an end.

As it stands, the Ravens will make their highest pick in an NFL draft since 2000 when they’ll be on the clock sixth overall. Or, they’ll trade up or down, which certainly isn’t out of the realm of possibility with three first-round trades having already been consummated long before teams arrive in Chicago.

But the Ravens are guaranteed to have a shiny new toy by the time the first round concludes late Thursday night.

To no one’s surprise, general manager Ozzie Newsome and the organization have been very quiet while everyone else tries to figure out exactly what the Ravens want to do. The good news is that when you’re coming off a 5-11 season and have multiple needs, you don’t have to be too desperate for the draft board to fall a certain way.

But that doesn’t mean a perfect prospect exists, either, as months of analysis and over-analysis have proven.

Mississippi left tackle Laremy Tunsil was considered the favorite to be the No. 1 pick before Tennessee traded out of the top spot two weeks ago, but a few are now speculating that even Notre Dame’s Ronnie Stanley could pass him in the draft rankings despite neither having played a game since January.

Nothing terrible, just more crying than usual. Parents at the weekly Mass that I usher are pretty considerate about bringing their uppity children to the back of church. Rarely must I walk to a pew and politely invite a parent and yelling child to join me in the rear because the tantrum has been going on for several minutes and now I’m getting glares with daggers from the parishioners as if to say, “Don’t just stand there, do something!”

Following Mass, I drove to our regular Sunday post-Mass restaurant for some cholesterol and arrived to a familiar scene and shrill. Outside the main entrance, a young couple was attempting to calm their young little guy who was unhappy. Very unhappy.

Inside, another little boy was crying, and crying, and crying, and crying, and crying, and crying, and loudly. He’s become a regular at this eatery and so has his melancholy behavior. Noticeable were the many annoyed faces of other patrons.

A certain dining establishment in Carolina Beach, North Carolina has had far too many similar experiences.

In this day and age of coexisting, everyone just getting along, linking hands and singing Kumbaya, Olde Salty's posts this sign for all who enter to see:

The restaurant policy sounds very much like my policy as a church usher. If a patron’s child is unruly, an Olde Salty’s employee will kindly, respectfully ask the parent to…..take it outside.

Oh my.

Unleash a whole bunch of angry backlash.

Stand back, everybody.

Blogger and former attorney/prosecutor KJ Dell’Antonia writes, “To put a sign that reads 'Screaming Children Will NOT Be Tolerated!' with that screamer of an exclamation point and those shouting capitals in the window of your restaurants is far more than a gentle suggestion. It's an admonishment, an advance assumption that those children will scream. It creates an immediate atmosphere of hostility towards families, and it is, in itself, rude. No one minds a reminder with a little humor: Screaming children will be placated with a cup of coffee and a free puppy. But an angry directive demanding your courtesy reflects an aggression that goes far beyond what's warranted. This is a sign that comes out swinging before the poster is even certain that another boxer is going to enter then ring.”

Strollerderby, the Mother of All Parenting Blogs writes, “The sign is rude – and classless.” A comment on the same blog reads, “I think the sign is lame, definitely rude, but incredibly vague. Where does the problem lie? Is that one small happy shriek from a two-year-old who just got peekaboo’d? Or lengthy crying? If my kid is saying something loudly and having fun and another patron can hear it, whether I it bothers them or not? Or if they whine a little because the food is slow getting to the table? There aren’t and can’t be written rules on these things, and parents can’t anticipate (nor should they)or be responsible for every little irritation someone else experiences. The sign is just bad business and poor taste. An establishment that is rude to paying customers will have a problem on its hands.”

Another commenter writes, “I’ve decided to open up my own restaurant, called ‘Intolerance Cafe’. Not only will screaming children be kicked out, I will not tolerate: loud talking, cellphone use of ANY kind, cigarette smoke, whistling noses, chewing gum, chewing anything with your mouth open PERIOD, slurping, loudly sucking the last of one’s soda, overly exaggerated sighing, eye-rolling, snorting, sleeping, or any sort of personal hygiene at the table.

A syringe-based system for the extrusion of hybrid polymer materials embedded with glass using layered SFF manufacturing has also been described (Calvert et al.

The day has arrived. WE ARE HERE. As is the case whenever we start a new series on Mark Watches, I highly advise that you read this introduction, even if you have been here for a long time. It contains not just a basic overview of the rules, but explains how scheduling is going to work. MUST READ.

1) Spoilers are not allowed in any form on Mark Watches. Please refrain from ever posting (in normal text) any sort of spoiler or reference to future storylines or developments while commenting on this site. This rule is probably a lot more strict than you’re used to, so if you’re warned about spoilers or if your comment is edited because of it, trust me. This is for a reason. Please visit the Spoiler Policy for guidance.

2) You may, however, post spoilers in rot13. You will inevitably see what looks like gibberish in the comments. We use rot13 to cipher all possible spoilers so that y’all can still have a conversation about each episode if you’ve seen the entire show. Please cipher all spoilers.

3) Please read the Site Rules before commenting. My group of moderators and I try to make Mark Watches an exception to the rule when it comes to online conversations. This means that moderation is more evident here than other places. Please review the rules, as this is your only warning.

4) Mark Watches videos are attached as a link at the end of the post. They are $0.99 each, and you can download each video 15 times, meaning you can send them to friends or anyone else for free. The system is built to handle free downloads, so download away. The lovely folks over at Mark Spoils run a place called the Black Market where you can find extra downloads of videos in case you cannot afford them or don’t want to pay for them. It’s totally sanctioned (and adored!) by me, so go ahead! Test them out. It’s basically me sitting and yelling at my TV, and I cry a lot because reasons.

5) Each review and video will cover one 11-minute episode. It’s easier to manage all the commissions that way, rather than try to stop an episode at the halfway point.

6) Because these are shorter, if you purchase a commission, you get TWO episodes to claim as yours. Please read the rules on the commission page otherwise.

7) As of right now, I’m going to TRY to complete a review for every day of the week. This is subject to change if it turns out that I’m still writing massive reviews despite the shorter episode length. But since the episodes are shorter, I’m predicting I�"

Three-axis accelerometers have heretofore been developed for use with motion control instrumentation, laptop computers, gaming consoles and cellular telephones, for example. Generally, such three-axis accelerometers operate based upon either piezoresistive or capacitive acceleration sensing. Capacitive three-axis accelerometers relate to the present invention and a variety of them are disclosed in various patents and publications.
A number of three-axis accelerometers have been patented by Kazuhiro Okada that use piezoresistive or capacitive acceleration sensing. U.S. Pat.

OPINION
KREMER, P.J.
The California Department of Corrections (CDC) and the Attorney General of the State of California (Attorney General) seek a peremptory writ of mandate and prohibition after Ronaldo M. Ayala (Ayala) sought certain records from the CDC by subpoena duces tecum and obtained an ex parte protective order from the Superior Court of San Diego County. The order directed, inter alia, that the subpoena duces tecum, the accompanying declaration of counsel, and the supporting memorandum of points and authorities be sealed, and prohibited the CDC and the Attorney General's office from discussing the contents of the sealed documents with, or providing copies of the subpoenaed documents to, the San Diego District Attorney's office. We grant the petition.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
In this capital case, Ayala is charged with murdering three individuals and with the robbery and attempted murder of a fourth individual. The District Attorney of San Diego County (District Attorney) is prosecuting the case against Ayala, and is alleging special circumstances pursuant to Penal Code[1] sections 190.2(a)(3) and 190.2(a)(17)(i). In its First Amended Notice of Aggravating Circumstances, section 190.3(b), the prosecution notified Ayala's counsel it intended to introduce evidence that Ayala, while an inmate at Folsom Prison, fatally stabbed another inmate, John Joe Casas (Casas). Apparently during its investigation, the District Attorney's office interviewed inmate Walter Lewis (Lewis) who claimed he was an eyewitness to the Casas killing and identified Ayala as the person responsible.
To investigate the allegations concerning Casas' death and to determine Lewis's credibility, Ayala subpoenaed Lewis's prison records and records pertaining to Casas' death from the CDC. At Ayala's request in ex parte proceedings, the superior court issued a protective order on October 21, 1987 (October 21 Order) sealing the subpoena, supporting declaration of counsel, and supporting points and authorities. The October 21 Order additionally provided the documents in question were to be delivered under seal *1091 to the court. The October 21 Order further designated a"

He grew up on the Oregon coast in North Bend when the air was thick with the scent of freshly sawn Douglas fir and the sound of mill whistles. He watched from his high school classroom window as tidal flats were filled and Pony Village Shopping Center built, which may have shaped his lifelong determination to preserve coastal resources. Playing in the “swamps” of upper Pony Slough, exploring tide pools at Cape Arago with his family, and skipping classes with pals to go watch thunderous winter waves at Shore Acres made him a true “coastie.” Graduating from Portland State University in 1968 with a degree in Earth Science, he began his career in coastal land use planning in the Coos County planning department, where he directed the first Coos Bay Estuary Plan and helped lead designation of South Slough as the nation’s first estuarine sanctuary in 1974. By the time he retired in 2010, he had spent nearly twenty years working on ocean issues and another eight years as the Coastal Program Manager for the Department of Land Conservation and Development. Along the way he coauthored The Oregon Oceanbook, 1985, helped enact the Oregon Ocean Resources Management Act, 1987, and was staff director for the Oregon Ocean Resources Management Plan, 1990 and the Oregon Territorial Sea Plan, 1994. If that weren’t enough fun, he served as a planning commission member (2000 – 2002) and elected city commissioner (2003-2006) in Oregon City. He is currently a member of the budget committee for the City of Salem, and the board of the Oregon Wave Energy Trust. In his discretionary time he plays guitar, banjo and washboard with friends and tries to keep his backyard looking good.

He has the distinction of having spent, cumulatively, close to a full year working underwater in the course of his career, studying temperate-boreal kelp forests, coral reefs, polar, and other subtidal ecological communities worldwide. He has his PhD from the University of California at Santa Cruz, and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

## Examples

Examples of how to build plugins of different types are included in the [example](example/) directory. To run the examples locally:

1. run `npm install` in the `draft-extend` directory
2. open any HTML file in the `examples` directory in your web browser - no local server is necessary

***

## Editor
**Editor component on which to extend functionality with plugins created by [`createPlugin`](#createplugin).**

#### Props
The most important two props are:
- `editorState` - Draft.js `EditorState` instance to be rendered.
- `onChange: function(editorState: EditorState): void` - Like with vanilla Draft.js, function called on any editor change passing the `EditorState`.

Other props are used by plugins composed around `Editor`. See [Building Plugins](building-plugins.md) for more information. **These should generally not be used outside of the context of a plugin**:
- `buttons`: `Array<Component>` Array of React components to add to the controls of the editor.
- `overlays`: `Array<Component>` Array of React components to add as overlays to the editor."

Persecution of priests, laity and the church became organized after the war, with books published linking the Catholic Church with the fascist Ustaše regime and the Western powers, to justify the persecution. The communists ignored the collaboration of 75 Catholic priests with the Yugoslav Partisans.

Faced with hostility from the Yugoslav communist authorities after the Second
World War, the bishops met in Zagreb and issued a pastoral letter from the Catholic bishops of Yugoslavia on 20 September 1945 protesting injustice, crimes, trials and executions. They protected innocent priests and laity, noting that they did not want to defend the guilty; the number truly guilty was believed small.

We admit that there were some priests who – seduced by the nationalistic patriotism – violated the sacred law of Christian justice and love, and who therefore deserve to be tried in the court of terrestrial justice.  We must however point out that the number of such priests is more than negligible, and that the serious allegations which have been presented in the press and in the meetings against a large part of the Catholic clergy in Yugoslavia, have to be included within tendentious attempts to deceive the public aware of the lies, and take away the reputation of the Catholic Church ..."
155,17,19108,"The present invention relates to the field of integrated circuits, and, more particularly, to power devices such as MOS-gated transistors.
Semiconductor devices in the form of integrated circuits are widely used in most electronic devices. For example, computers, cellular telephones, and other similar devices typically include one or more integrated circuits (ICs). In addition, many typical types of ICs are based upon metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology wherein each transistor includes doped source and drain regions in a semiconductor substrate, with a well or channel region between the drain and source.
One particular configuration of MOS field effect transistor (FET) which is commonly used for high power applications is the so-called trench MOSFET. In this configuration, a semiconductor layer is formed on a substrate and doped to form a well region on a surface of the semiconductor layer opposite the substrate. Trenches are etched in the well region, usually down to the semiconductor layer, to define several body portions or pillars that extend outward from the semiconductor layer. A MOS-gated device is formed in the trenches which includes an oxide layer adjacent the trench and a corresponding portion of the semiconductor layer, and a conductive layer (e.g., polysilicon) adjacent the oxide layer. Source regions are doped on the surfaces of the pillars, and the substrate and semiconductor layer define a drain region. Channel regions will extend between the source regions and the drain region.
While the configuration of power MOSFETs makes them well suited for handling large amounts of power, a drawback of typical power MOSFET devices is that a high electric field tends to form at the trench bottoms, i.e., near the junction between the gate oxide layer and the semiconductor layer. This field may result in a failure of the oxide due to hot carrier injection, which is commonly referred to as hot carrier aging."
156,19,24338,"Up in the air about a sticky issue

Writing sex scenes isn’t necessarily rocket science, but it can have something in common with rocket science. Such as when the male participant goes all Cape Canaveral. Because, you know what they say: “What comes up, must go down.”

Or something like that.

Anyway, after writing one particular scene where the guy’s payload goes airborne, I remembered something important: Women read these books. And I wondered if the typical woman experiencing this outcome would think, “Houston, we have a problem,” or “Fly me to the moon.”

The poll results were revelatory. “On my tits,” with 12 votes, out-tallied “on my ass” and the far-ranging “on my lower back/feet/neck” category, each of which drew nine votes. Both beat out “on my face” which came in last place with six votes—but maybe not for the reason you think. “In my mouth” finished third with 26 votes, giving legitimacy to penile nicknames like “love gun” and suggesting that women prefer men with good aim—which, by the way, requires practice.

With 49 votes, the most popular destination was “on (not in) my pussy,” indicating that sometimes a woman prefers a man whose aim is a little off. “Anywhere and everywhere” finished second, which means more ladies gave a thumbs-up to feet than it seems at first glance.

It’s not surprising that the so-called facial got such low marks. The Jezebel.com article cites sex experts who say it’s an act of humiliation. Not that it’s intrinsically demeaning, though—feelings vary widely from one woman to another. What was surprising was that Megan Andelloux, founder ofthe Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health, said, “Many people struggle to believe that receiving a facial is something a woman could enjoy.” So much so, that a female student who said in class that she experienced her first orgasm when her boyfriend came on her face endured the wrath of other women, “as if by admitting a liking for facials, she was committing an act of violence against other women.”

Interesting, but not germane to my question. Since my San Fernando Dreams sex scene involves no body parts with cheeks, I determined it should play okay with the target demo. Still, I felt I could do more research on the actual target.

On the other hand, Batski’s comment on that TFP.com poll was, “When my lover wanks over my tits, it’s very horny, and I love to see how excited he gets, and watch his come shoot over my tits, and I know it really turns him on when I rub all his spunk in like body lotion. That’s erotic and hot.”

The post is written as a conversation between a man and a woman who both said they’d participated in such a thing. The woman copped to twice in her life, while the man stressed that he’d never done it “within the, like, first three times"

Like factory managers and workers pressed to meet production quotas, editors and journalists were continually pressed to produce scoops and ""news"" to beat the competition. Murdoch's employees were reminded that their jobs depended on their production.

In that sort of environment, it's not surprising that journalistic standards would go out the window. In the world of celebrity gossip sheets, it's common for photographers and writers--known as the paparazzi--to stalk celebrities in the hopes of catching them in scandalous situations. In this way, the paparazzi ""create"" news where it didn't exist.

Taking a leaf from that book, News of the World staff moved more aggressively to insert themselves into the news production process--hiring private investigators, paying off police to get ""inside"" information on developing stories, and, ultimately, hacking into people's personal data.

Practices like employing private investigators or specialized researchers have a place in legitimate journalism that serves some concept of the public interest. Think of the role that Northwestern University journalism students, working with private investigators, played in winning the release of the falsely convicted Anthony Porter from Illinois death row in 1999. Porter came within days of being executed before he was exonerated--that was one of the key events to expose the Illinois death machine--and eventually lead, earlier this year, to abolition of the death penalty in the state.

President Donald Trump only saw for the first time on Tuesday emails offering his eponymous son information about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, his lawyer asserted on the TODAY Show Wednesday.

“You know when the president saw the email? When everyone else did,” the president’s personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, said. He also said that Trump did not attend the June 9, 2016, meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and his son that took place in Trump Tower.

President Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he had no problem with the meeting.

""I think many people would have held that meeting,"" Trump said. ""It was a 20-minute meeting, I guess, from what I’m hearing. Many people, and many political pros, said everybody would do that.""

On Tuesday, Trump Jr. released via twitter the chain of emails with music publicist Rob Goldstone, who wrote that the attorney has “information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Sekulow also insisted that no laws had been broken by Trump’s son.

“We know what the facts are now,” said Sekulow. “The chain of emails are out there. Under that scenario there is no violation of any law. There’s no statue that’s even in play.""

“This was a 20 minute meeting,” he added. “It was opposition research. We are acting like that doesn’t ever happen.”

Related: Did Trump Jr. Break Laws When He Met Russian Lawyer Veselnitskaya?

But past Republican campaign operatives have said that Trump Jr.'s willingness to meet with someone with information said to be from Russia was indeed out of the ordinary.

""Umm, Jr., i have worked on over 100 campaigns and it is first time i have heard of someone meeting w/ foreign adversary to get oppo. [opposition research],"" wrote Matthew Dowd, who worked on President George W. Bush's 2004 election campaign, on Monday on Twitter.

Nicole Wallace, who also worked with Bush and is now an MSNBC host, responded in agreement:

Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha

""I second that. I handled oppo - not exactly the high minded side of campaigning, but a reality - but never ever from a foreign adversary,"" she replied on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, stressed Wednesday that Veselnitskaya did not represent Russia.

""A lawyer represents the Russian state if he participates in a case on behalf of the Russian state, where the Russian state acts as plaintiff or defendant, and in this case there was nothing like that,"" Peskov said. ""That's why the question, the wording is inappropriate and absurd.""

Veselnitskaya represents wealthy Russians, and is the go-to lawyer for the Moscow regional government, The New York Times reported in a bio piece on her Wednesday.

In early morning tweets Wednesday, Trump praised and defended his son.

“My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!"" the president posted

My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017

In his first interview after the revelations in the media, Trump Jr. said on Tuesday on Fox News Channel that “in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.”

He added that he may have had conversations with other Russians as well.

Trump Jr. claimed he released his emails on Twitter because wanted to be “totally transparent” and dismissed the significance of the emails and meeting.

But a deputy managing editor for The New York Times said the emails were only made public by Trump Jr. after he was informed"

162,11,28164,"Celtic have a foot in the Champions League group stage after beating Astana 5-0 in the first leg of their play-off but this success will not benefit other clubs

It was not enough to appreciate Celtic’s 5-0 trouncing of Astana in isolation. The full-time whistle had barely blown on yet another stirring European occasion when the tired cliche arose regarding how wonderful imminent Champions League qualification was for Scottish football. There should be no harm in dismissing such a theory even if it is obvious why it arises: Scottish football is desperate for all the scraps of hope it can gather.

Scott Sinclair double inspires classy Celtic to march towards group stages Read more

That Celtic are on the verge of participation in the prime event of the European club scene for a second year in succession means enormous credit is due to Brendan Rodgers. He has reinvigorated the side since his appointment last summer. Celtic’s board, castigated as the club flatlined during Ronny Deila’s tenure, have once again seen sound judgment and investment fully rewarded. Rodgers has created an atmosphere akin to the spell of Martin O’Neill, with the combination of shrewd signings plus the overseeing of sharp improvement by existing personnel re-establishing a coach who was bruised when he left Liverpool. Rodgers has not only succeeded, he has done it with panache.

Celtic as a business remains prudently and professionally run. For the old-fashioned among us, and on checking some of the names who now compete in the Champions League, it is perfectly fair that a club of this standing is among the elite. In basic football terms, Rodgers will relish the opportunity to check for improvement from Champions League displays of a year ago. Matches such as these define the players and their manager far more than a Friday night at Ross County ever will.

But great for Scottish football? A boost to the status of the national sport? We should be spared this overreaction. When a club – or two clubs, let us be clear – with fiscal power to dwarf all before them earns another £30m advantage, the case for broader benefit is virtually non-existent. Only two factors serve as counterpoints: other clubs receive a small and variable consolidation payment from Uefa because of Celtic’s progress, and if indigenous players are afforded more game time against top-level opposition then no harm can be done. Beyond that, the benefit is entirely Celtic’s, as they should be perfectly happy to admit in celebration of their own efforts.

Pointing out such basic reality is met with fury by those supporters of Celtic who appear to believe their club is indulging in a form of missionary work. A dominant Rangers were Champions League regulars in the 1990s; the Scottish game was already in an epic decline, with these European forays doing absolutely nothing to halt that.

Celtic, the economic entity and football team, are not representative of Scottish football. A glance at accounts portrays that much. There is no other way to explain a scenario where a manager’s salary is 10 times the first-team wage bill of clubs in the same league. This is not Celtic’s fault or a reason for embarrassment but it is crazy to ignore a gulf which, owing to an imminent Champions League return, will only grow. With that comes consequences.

It is legitimate to ask when a title challenge will exist. Rival clubs are not lacking in ambition or desire, merely the key element of"

Sorting NSArray of objects on Date property

I'm trying to sort an NSArray of objects based on a date property. The order I'm looking for is the most recent date first, ending with the earliest date.
e.g 
05/15/2014
05/12/2014
02/20/2014
25/12/2013
10/11/2013
I've attempted a number of different approaches seen in the accepted answer in ""This"" thread.
But my ordering is off for example
NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@""dateToPay"" ascending:YES];
            NSArray *orderedArray = [cashFlowItemsArray sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:[NSArray arrayWithObject:sortDescriptor]];

I'm having trouble with PHP's date() function. Specifically which day of the week it is

I'm attempting to build a website for a small local business. What I'm attempting to do right now is make a small alert message pop up based on times showing if the business is open, closing soon, or closed.
I've set up some variables for the business's opening, closing, and ""last call"" times as well as today's day of the week, and the current time.
Then I set up two if elseif statements. The first sets the variable $status to either 1, 2 or 3, and the second displays different bits of HTML based on $status.
Here's my code:
<?php

date_default_timezone_set(""America/New_York"");

$now_hour = date(""H"");
$now_min = date(""i"");
$today = date( ""d"" );
$open = 10;
$warn_hour = 18;
$warn_min = 30;
$close = 19;

if ( $today = 0 ) {
        $status = 0;
} elseif ( $now_hour < $open ) {
        $status = 0;                                                        
} elseif ( $now_hour > $close ) {
        $status = 0;
} elseif ( $now_hour > $warn_hour && $now_min > $warn_min ) {
        $status = 1;
} else {
        $status = 2;
};

if ( $status = 0 ) {?>
    <div class=""alert alert-danger"" role=""alert"">Sorry! We're closed!</div>
<?php } elseif ($status = 1) {?>
    <div class=""alert alert-warning"" role=""alert"">We're closing soon! Hurry up and get your orders in!</div>
<?php } elseif ($status = 2) {?>
    <div class=""alert alert-success"" role=""alert"">We're open! Come enjoy a hot dog!</div>
<?php } else {?>
    <div class=""alert alert-info"" role=""alert"">There's been an error. Check our hours to see if we're open.</div>
<?php };?>

This isn't the first iteration of this code. I've tried several different structures, including making the two different if elseifs into one. I've also written in some echos to see where it gets stuck. It seems that my $today variable ALWAYS thinks its Sunday and yet somehow makes $status = 1.

A:

You are using '=' in your if statements instead of '==' :)
<?php

date_default_timezone_set(""America/New_York"");

$now_hour = date(""H"");
$now_min = date(""i"");
$today = date( ""d"" );
$open = 10;
$warn_hour = 18;
$warn_min = 30;
$close = 19;

    $status = 0;

171,18,12240,"This week I’m trying to work through some issues about myself, it’s odd to think I actually put myself through difficulties by being over critical or judgemental of myself. But apparently I do self judge and it’s not good, I am also inpatient which I didn’t realise fully either until it was spelt out to me the other day.

I have known I’m self critical for some time, I mean I constantly put myself down and yet I had never realised how much I judge myself. In therapy the other day I realised that actually I am repeating behaviours from my past and judging myself. I think part of this is the fact despite thinking I now accept my Dissociative Identity Disorder, in my heart I still don’t, well not fully.

I have always wanted to be normal whatever normal is and I have always striven to just be good enough. As a child and an adult I always wanted to be good enough to be loved by my mum, but I now realise no matter what I did it wasn’t something I could achieve. Not because I lacked something or was flawed but because the women who gave birth to me wasn’t able to love me. It was her flaw not mine and that’s taken me time to both realise and accept.

As a child I was taught only A grades were good enough and so I learnt to judge myself and see myself as a failure when I didn’t quite make the grade. I also learnt to judge myself as a young mum and wife, my mother taught me to judge myself by her actions of judging me.

As an adult I felt a failure when I was mentally unwell and needed to go to hospital, yes some people in society judged me but that wasn’t my fault, those who judged me were being misguided. Since I’ve been home I have continued to judge myself every step of my journey, because it is a natural reaction that has been inbuilt in me by the way I was raised.

Yet now I realise I don’t need to judge myself in this way, I can be honest with myself and accept my positives instead of being so harsh. This is a strange concept for me and it’s going to take time to get used to but I will, I deserve to. I am having to learn that in truth I don’t know what normal is, who is to say I’m not normal and other people without"

175,26,18118,"Cantabrian Mountains

The Cantabrian Mountains or Cantabrian Range () are one of the main systems of mountain ranges in Spain. 
They stretch for over 300 km (180 miles) across northern Spain, from the western limit of the Pyrenees to the Galician Massif in Galicia, along the coast of the Cantabrian Sea. Their easternmost end meets the Sistema Ibérico.

These mountains are a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System physiographic division. 

The Cantabrian Mountains offer a wide range of trails for hiking, as well as many challenging climbing routes. Skiing is possible in the ski resorts of Alto Campoo, Valgrande-Pajares, Fuentes de Invierno, San isidro, Leitariegos and Manzaneda.

Geography

The Cantabrian Mountains stretch east-west, nearly parallel to the sea, as far as the pass of Leitariegos, also extending south between León and Galicia. The range's western boundary is marked by the valley of the river Minho (), by the lower Sil, which flows into the Miño, and by the Cabrera River, a small tributary of the Sil. Cantabrian mountains reach its south-western limit in Portugal.

As a whole, the Cantabrian Mountains are remarkable for their intricate ramifications, but almost everywhere, and especially in the east, it is possible to distinguish two principal ranges, from which the lesser ridges and mountain masses radiate. One range, or series of ranges, closely follows the outline of the coast; the other, which is loftier, forms the northern limit of the great tableland of Castile and León, and is sometimes regarded as a continuation of the Pyrenees.  In some parts the coastal range rises sheer above the sea, and everywhere has so abrupt a declivity that the streams which flow seaward are all short and swift.

The descent from the southern range to the high plateaux of Castile is more gradual, and several large rivers, notably the Ebro, rise here and flow to the south or west. The breadth of the Cantabrian chain, with all its ramifications, increases from about 60 mi (97 km); in the east to about  in the west. Many peaks are over  high, but the greatest altitudes are attained in the central ridges on the borders of León, Asturias, Palencia and Cantabria. Here are the highest peak Torre de Cerredo (), Peña Vieja (), Peña Prieta () and Espigüete (); an unnamed summit in the Picos de Europa, to which range the Peña Vieja also belongs, rises on the right bank of the Sella to a height of ; further west the peaks of Manpodres, Peña Ubiña, Peña Rubia and Cuiña all exceed.

176,17,18129,"Talairach coordinates

Talairach coordinates, also known as Talairach space, is a 3-dimensional coordinate system (known as an 'atlas') of the human brain, which is used to map the location of brain structures independent from individual differences in the size and overall shape of the brain. It is still common to use Talairach coordinates in functional brain imaging studies and to target transcranial stimulation of brain regions. However, alternative methods such as the MNI Coordinate System originated at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital have largely replaced Talairach for stereotaxy and other procedures.

History
The coordinate system was first created by neurosurgeons Jean Talairach and Gabor Szikla in their work on the Talairach Atlas in 1967, creating a standardized grid for neurosurgery. The grid was based on the idea that distances to lesions in the brain are proportional to overall brain size (i.e., the distance between two structures is larger in a larger brain). In 1988 a second edition of the Talairach Atlas came out that was coauthored by Tournoux, and it is sometimes known as the Talairach–Tournoux system. This atlas was based on single post-mortem dissection of a human brain.

The Talairach Atlas uses Brodmann areas as the labels for brain regions.

Description
The Talairach coordinate system is defined by making two anchors, the anterior commissure and posterior commissure, lie on a straight horizontal line. Since these two points lie on the midsagittal plane, the coordinate system is completely defined by requiring this plane to be vertical. Distances in Talairach coordinates are measured from the anterior commissure as the origin (as defined in the 1998 edition). The y-axis points posterior and anterior to the commissures, the left and right is the x-axis, and the z-axis is in the ventral-dorsal (down and up) directions. Once the brain is reoriented to these axes, the researchers must also outline the six cortical outlines of the brain: anterior, posterior, left, right, inferior, and superior. In the 1967 atlas the left is with positive coordinates while in the 1988 atlas the left has negative coordinates.

By defining standard anatomical landmarks that could be identified on different subjects (the anterior and posterior commissures), it became easier to spatially warp an individual brain image obtained through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and other imaging methods to this standard Talairach space. One can then make inferences about tissue identity at a specific location by referring to the atlas.

Brodmann regions in neuroscience 

The Brodmann area is an illustration of a cytoarchitectonic map of the human brain that was published by Korbinan Brodmann in his 1909 monogram. Brodmann's map splits the cerebral cortex into 43 differing parts, which become visible in cell-body stained histological sections. Years later, a large group of neuroscientists still utilize Brodmann's map for the localization of neuroimaging data that is obtained in living human brains.

Brodmann in relation to Talairach coordinates 
Some neuroimaging techniques, in fact, purported the use of Brodmann's area as a guideline for Talairach coordinates. Further, these technologies showcase that experimental tasks in a common reference space become possible through imaging the living human brain by registering function and having architectonic data performed and defined.

Brodmann's map proved useful in varying neuroimaging software packages and stereotaxic atlases, such as the Talairach atlas. This atlas also serves as a demonstration of the inherent problems (i.e., impressions of matches between areal borders and sulcal landmarks may lead to wrong conclusions in terms of localization of cytoarchitectonic borders or the usage of Brodmann's map without knowledge of the text that accompanies the drawing misleading researchers to false conclusions).

Conversion to other coordinate systems

Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) templates 
Another common atlas for the human brain is the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) coordinate system, which is the template used for SPM and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping. Most neuroimaging software packages are able to convert from Talairach to MNI coordinates.

However, disparities between MNI and Talairach coordinates can impede the comparison of results across different studies. This problem is most prevalent in situations where coordinate disparities should be corrected to reduce error, such as coordinate-based meta-analyses. There is a possibility that these disparities"

182,16,12888,"Nintendo may have left its Vitality Sensor by the wayside, but researchers at Boston Children's Hospital are using heart rate monitoring in a video game to teach children with anger issues how to temper their emotions. Dubbed RAGE (Regulate and Gain Emotional) Control, the game tasks players with blasting hostile spaceships while keeping their heart rate from exceeding a predefined limit. If a gamer's pulse rises above the ceiling, they'll lose the ability to shoot until they can ease their pulse back down. A group of 18 kids who received standard treatments and played the game for five, 15-minute-long sessions had better control of their heart rate and lower anger levels than a group that only used traditional treatments. Currently, a controlled clinical trial of RAGE Control is underway and there are plans to take the concept a step further with toys and games suited for younger children. Look out below for the full press release or tap the second source link for the team's paper in the Journal of Adolescent Psychiatry.

Children with anger issues show a drop in anger after playing ""RAGE Control""

Oct. 24, 2012 Boston, Mass.,-Children with serious anger problems can be helped by a simple video game that hones their ability to regulate their emotions, finds a pilot study at Boston Children's Hospital. Results were published online October 24 in the journal Adolescent Psychiatry.

Noticing that children with anger control problems are often uninterested in psychotherapy, but very eager to play video games, Jason Kahn, PhD, and Joseph Gonzalez-Heydrich, MD, at Boston Children's Hospital developed ""RAGE Control"" to motivate children to practice emotional control skills that they can later use in challenging life situations.

The fast-paced game involves shooting at enemy spaceships while avoiding shooting at friendly ones. As children play, a monitor on one finger tracks their heart rate and displays it on the computer screen. When heart rate goes above a certain level, players lose their ability to shoot at the enemy spaceships. To improve their game, they must learn to keep calm.

""The connections between the brain's executive control centers and emotional centers are weak in people with severe anger problems,"" explains Gonzalez-Heydrich, chief of Psychopharmacology at Boston Children's and senior investigator on the study. ""However, to succeed at RAGE Control, players have to learn to use these centers at the same time to score points.""

The study, led by first author Peter Ducharme, MSW, a clinical social worker at Boston Children's, compared two groups of 9- to 17-year-old children admitted to the hospital's Psychiatry Inpatient Service who had high levels of anger. To qualify for the study, the children had to have a normal IQ and not need a medication change during the five-day study period.

One group, with 19 children, received standard treatments for anger including cognitive-behavioral therapy, presentation of relaxation techniques and social skills training for five consecutive business days. The second group, with 18 children, got these same treatments, but spent the last 15 minutes of their psychotherapy session playing RAGE Control.

After five sessions, the video gamers were significantly better at keeping their heart rate down. They showed clinically significant decreases in anger scores on the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory-Child and Adolescent (STAXI-CA), and specifically on:

the intensity of anger at a particular time

the frequency of angry feelings over time

expression of anger towards others and objects

The gamers also had a decrease in suppressed, internalized anger that reached marginal statistical significance. In contrast, the standard-treatment group showed no significant change from baseline on any of the above measures.

The video gamers gave their therapy experience high marks for helpfulness (5 to 6 on a scale of 7). ""Kids reported feeling better control of their emotions when encountering day to day frustrations on the unit,"" says Ducharme. ""While this was a pilot study, and we weren't able to follow the kids after they were discharged, we think the game will help them control their emotions in other environments."" More studies in progress

The investigators are now conducting a randomized,"

Change, as for how often the bass distorts on the 1840, I haven't tested at length (been gaming mostly), though since I've been very cautious of the AD being delivered, I listened to music on the 1840 at low volumes. It's a very enjoyable low volume headphone due to it's clarity and neutral sound.

Nameless, the alcantara is... the best thing. Seriously, better than pure velour. I feel the 1540 pads are amazing, over the 1840 pads. But it recesses the mids a bit for me, on the 1840 and MA900.

If it hadnt, id have asked Change for the 1540 pads for the MA900 instead, lol.

You're really trying to sell me on this Alcantara stuff, aren't you? Well, you almost had me...up until the recessed mids part. I can't have that!

I was especially hoping for the possibility of Beyerdynamic-compatible Alcantara pads that might be more comfortable than their nice velour pads, and possibly even bring out the mids a little more, to level out this MMX 300 a bit...speaking of which, you wanna review that any time soon? I know the whole ""spliced headphone connector"" thing might have you concerned, but I'm confident in my handiwork fixing that up.

I forgot to ask, how does the 1540 sound with the 1840 velours? I'm sure bass will be reduced by quite a bit, but is it offensive?

I think the 1540 pads are the best pads I've ever felt in comfort out of all pads, ever. They'd make the MA900 even better than the 1840 pads, but it just doesn't suit them at all.

The invention herein relates to a novel human monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab), cloned by phage display that binds specifically to oxidized forms of low density lipoproteins (OxLDL) and not native LDL. More particularly, it relates to the use of the antibody for improved methods of diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.
2. Description of Prior Art
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that results from hyperlipidemia and a complex interplay of a variety of environmental, metabolic and genetic risk factors. The oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a central, if not obligatory role, in the atherogenic process. Early studies showed that acetylation of LDL greatly enhanced its uptake by macrophges and that the uptake occurred via “scavenger receptors” which were distinct from the classical LDL receptor. Unlike most receptors, these scavenger receptors were not downregualted following uptake of OxLDL. Due to the excessive uptake of OxLDL and its associated lipid by the macrophages, the cells obtained a characteristic foam-like appearance. The appearance of such cells is one of the first hallmarks of atherosclerotic disease. Foam cells accumulate within the intima (under the endothelial lining) of the vessel walls where they become unstable and plaques, the hallmarks of more advanced disease. Inflammatory conditions develop leading to the development of complicated lesions.
There is much evidence that OxLDL contributes to atherogenesis by a number of mechanisms. The oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids of lipoproteins generates many breakdown products such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and other reactive moieties"
186,6,16443,"A crowded field of car companies, tech giants, and startups is racing to get self-driving cars into the hands of drivers ASAP.

Blink and you might miss the moment automated vehicles go mainstream. At some point in 2017, a fully autonomous Tesla will blast across the country en route from Los Angeles to New York. The person sitting in the front left seat — let’s no longer call her the driver — will be free to watch a movie, drink a latte, or wave to locals as she zips past. If Elon Musk has his way, the tech will then roll out to drivers in 2018. That timeline might be optimistic, but at least one thing is clear: 2017 is the year in which self-driving cars of numerous makes will embark on ambitious rounds of testing. Both Ford and BMW will send their autonomous cars through their paces in Europe. VW just launched its smart mobility brand Moia, with a focus on self-driving shuttles, and Volvo is pushing ahead with plans to give 100 self-driving XC90 crossovers to consumers in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Not to be outdone, the big technology firms are also sending their cars out into the world. Baidu has started offering public rides along a two-mile stretch of road in China, while Uber will likely expand its passenger trials beyond Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Lyft and even Apple are likely to make self-driving news in the coming year, as well.

This rush to deployment has caught some industry watchers by surprise. For years, a single company — Google — had hogged the headlines for tinkering with robotic vehicles and quietly wooing regulators. Then, in 2015, a horde of startups and newcomers burst onto the scene, eager to explore the boundaries of self-driving technologies—and the rules surrounding them.

“2017 will show us that limited deployments are technically, legally, and socially possible, even under today’s laws,” says Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina.

The cars themselves, with their distinctive sensor rigs mounted onto their rooftops, will be most visible as they putter down our roads. Behind the scenes, their makers are hurrying to iron out the technical, regulatory, and economic details needed so that one day somewhat soon, most of us will get to take our stupendously fallible meat gloves off the wheel.

From the tech side, this reality seems imminent. The prices of these cars’ most important sensors are plummeting. Laser-ranging lidar units — the things that build up a 3D image of the car’s surroundings — used to cost multiples of the cars on which they were mounted. Now they are priced in the thousands or even hundreds of dollars. Radars, which help pinpoint other road users, are also getting smaller and cheaper, and today’s high-definition video cameras are so cheap they are almost free.

New approaches are around the corner, too. Israeli startup Oryx Vision is working on what it calls coherent optical radar, a system that uses a terahertz infrared laser and clever microscopic antennas to scan the roadway further ahead and in more detail than lidar — and without the danger of being blinded by sunlight or fog. It hopes to build a demo unit by the end of 2017 with thousands of tiny nanoantennas on a chip, eventually costing just a few dollars.

The price drops and gains in performance amount to “a continuous stream of significant advancements in all perception-related technologies,” says Bobby Hambrick, CEO of AutonomouStuff, a supplier of automotive technologies.

The computing power to handle this firehose of sensor data is also becoming more widely accessible. Nvidia now offers an off-the-shelf Drive PX 2 self-driving computing platform, which is likely to feature in robocars from Tesla, Baidu, and others. But it faces stiff competition from automotive suppliers Bosch and Delphi, as well as two Bay Area startups founded by ex-Googlers — Nuro.ai and an as-yet-unnamed company being run by the company’s well-respected former self-driving car lead, Chris Urmson.

And then of course there is Google itself, which has finally spun out its 58 autonomous vehicles, two million miles of self-driving experience, and legion of engineers into a standalone company called Waymo. Waymo seems to be focusing on partnerships with car makers rather than developing its own self-driving prototype.

For this is 2017’s real prize: to develop an operating system that can scale beyond a few experimental autonomous cars to power tomorrow’s mass-produced self-driving fleets. Waymo’s first step in that direction is a partnership with Fiat Chrysler that will evolve next year into a ridesharing scheme using 100 Pacifica minivans.

However, at the moment when all Chinese fans were cheering the upcoming opportunity to get a closer look at the masterpiece by Blizzard, there came a sad news, saying, Starcraft 2 was banned by authorities from being exhibited on this year’s ChinaJoy.



Again, Blizzard failed when facing Chinese goverment.



The detailed cause of ban remains unkown. Up till now, Two accounts were given unofficially by online media.



The former said that The State Bureau Of Culture called a halt to Starcraft 2 on ChinaJoy, for “Starcraft 2 is much too bloody, which will severely effect the mental as well as physical health of adolescents”.



The latter is in a more institutional tone, saying, according to the lastest regulation released on July 1st,2009, “Any activity related to foreign games, including their showing, demostrating, trading and marketing promotion, shall also abide by the censorship laws aming at imported online games”, meaning any foreign game, if it wanna put in an appearence in any public event inside China, “shall be subject to censorship and approval by the State Admimistartion Of News And Press.”, or it will no doubt be banned, and “all promoters, sponsors, and companies related shall held their respective legal responsibilities.”



PLU, the official partner of OGN in China had planned to broadcast the exhibition matches live via online TV, with its best narrators =XD=love, Sanpao, etc. commentating. But they cancelled the plan yesterday, issuing an terse official statement, saying they had to change their plan for some nontechnical reason.



BTW, both Blizzard and its Chinese partner NetEase have never officially announced anything about Starcraft2 on ChinaJoy, nonetheless, several news are leaked by some insiders, including the photos below, showing Blizzard and NetEase’s booths on this year's ChinaJoy, with large Starcraft 2 posters hanging.

191,20,26306,"But having not taken the opportunities, we were always susceptible to the counter-attack and when Robbie Brady’s clipped ball over the top found substitute Wood breaking from deep on his Premier League debut, Burnley’s new signing drilled into the far corner to level it up.

That opened the game up and, as Burnley came out of their shell in search of an equaliser, we created some good chances on goal, only for Heaton to deny Kane twice, Eriksen and Dele in a 10-minute spell.

The goal came four minutes after the break when Christian Eriksen’s corner landed at the feet of Dele and with his second attempt, he smashed the ball past Tom Heaton.

Harry Kane and Eric Dier sent headers over the bar, with Ben Mee and James Tarkowski doing the same at the other end of the pitch, while Tarkowski was proving a rock at the heart of the Burnley defence, blocking our shots time and again.

The visitors kept it tight and compact in defence during the first half, ensuring they always had plenty of numbers back and, while we enjoyed the majority of possession, we struggled to create chances.

Dele Alli’s goal early in the second half was cancelled out by a stoppage-time Chris Wood strike as we were held to a draw by Burnley at Wembley Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

Team News

Mauricio Pochettino made one change from the side which lost to Chelsea last weekend, Heung-Min Son replacing Victor Wanyama, who had picked up a knee injury. New signing Davinson Sanchez was on the bench for the first time, as was 17-year-old Academy central midfielder Tashan Oakley-Boothe, who featured for the first team in pre-season. Mousa Dembele made his 200th Spurs appearance in all competitions.

Key Action

Chances: both sides heading for goal – 7-38mins

It was a fairly even contest for the opening 10 minutes, Brady testing Hugo Lloris with a cross-shot which he had to push away for a corner, Mee heading the set-piece over the bar on seven minutes. At the other end, Tarkowski blocked Eriksen’s shot, before Kane headed Ben Davies’ free-kick over at the back post and Dier did likewise from an Eriksen centre on 23 minutes. Tarkowski then couldn’t keep his header down, while the defender was in the right place again from a defensive point of view, blocking Kane’s 38th-minute shot-on-the-turn after good build-up play down our left.

Goal: Spurs 1-0 Burnley – Dele Alli – 49mins

Having found Burnley so difficult to break down in the first half, it took just four minutes of the second to open the scoring. Eriksen’s corner was flicked on at the near post by Jan Vertonghen, the ball fell to Dele whose first shot from eight yards out was accidentally blocked by Mousa Dembele, but the rebound came straight back to him and he lashed it past Heaton.



Above: Eric Dier goes up for a header.

Save: Lloris denies Brady – 71mins

The goal changed the whole complexion of the game, with Burnley sending on strikers Ashley Barnes and Wood as they searched for an equaliser and they were far more adventurous in their play. Kane did almost make it 2-0 in the"

195,27,24637,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- On Tuesday, the winding stretch of I-90 roadway -- famously known as Dead Man's Curve -- got another one.

Not another victim. Heck, fatalities are nearly unheard of at Dead Man's Curve. A veteran Cleveland police crash investigator knows of only two since the Grand Prix course-turned highway opened to drivers in 1958.

But an eastbound tractor-trailer took the curve too fast just after noon, and a load of metal coils spilled onto the roadway, which eventually sent an GMC sport utility vehicle flipping over as the driver tried to hopscotch to safety.

A tow truck had to be called for the SUV, the metal coils hauled away and traffic was snarled for four hours. You know the drill.

The accident was the 63rd at the curve involving commercial truck traffic since 2009, according to crash reports filed with the Ohio Department of Public Safety. Those wrecks have caused property damage more than half the time and caused injuries in at least 24 cases.

A check of the truck crash records for the curve show the usual reasons -- unsafe speeds, following too closely, improper lane changes. But what about the roadway design itself? Does a freeway where big rigs and others have to slow down to 35 mph really make any cotton-picking sense?

""We aren't police investigators. We don't know the exact causes of crashes but certainly speed played a factor in many of crashes, and unstable loads could play a factor in many,"" said Steve Faulkner, press secretary for the Ohio Department of Transportation. ""I don't believe you are going to see a police report that says roadway design caused an accident.""

In the next breath though, Faulkner acknowledged that the I-90 Inner Belt Curve -- ODOT officials get huffy at the ""dead man"" nickname -- is flawed and far below today's design standards. But just like Northeast Ohio drivers, ODOT officials are stuck with it.

""Would we build a road like that today? No. That design is no longer even valid,"" Faulkner said. ""We wouldn't build the road using that kind of geometric measurement. I can't get in the head of the design engineer from back in the 1950s, but I can tell you that it met all of the guidelines and regulations at that time.""

Faulkner said the road was designed in 1955, when tail fins still ruled the road and having drivers slow down for sharp curves on the freeway was perfectly acceptable.

""Sixty years have passed and a lot can change, and it has when it comes to the geometric standards when building or restructuring a section of roadway,"" he said.

Faulkner noted that about 2.1 million trucks travel through the curve annually, so having an accident rate of 63 since 2009 isn't alarming.

Sgt. Jeff Tyhulski, a 20-year veteran of the Cleveland Police accident investigation unit, said he knows of only two fatalities at the curve both from a decade or more ago, and that serious injuries from accidents are pretty rare as well on Dead Man's Curve.

ODOT is out of cheap fixes to the problem. It has installed huge speed limit signs, rumble strips and lowered the speed limit on Dead Man's Curve. ODOT's permanent fix is a $301 million plan to soften the curve so cars could travel 55 mph instead of being forced to slow down.

But that idea resides in what ODOT calls Tier 3, a kind of purgatory for highway projects the agency wants to do but has no hope of funding anytime soon.

The only real chance for getting projects done from Tier 3 before the Browns win a Super Bowl is for ODOT to get a major influx of money. Faulkner said that's why creative approaches like privatization of state rest stops or leasing the Ohio Turnpike are being discussed.

Dead Man's Curve has been a pain in the gearshift for truckers since it was built, said Larry Davis, president of the Ohio Trucking Association. ""I'm born and raised in Medina, so I've been listening to complaints about Dead Man"
196,1,11947,"UNC student-athletes join the conversation over Silent Sam

Ezra Baeli-Wang poses with his gear in the fencing room in 2017. The former UNC and ACC Student-Athlete Advisory Committee President wrote an open letter to University officials against Silent Sam that has been signed by almost 300 current and former UNC student-athletes.

Share

When Ezra Baeli-Wang sat down Tuesday and wrote an open letter to UNC officials that he would later circulate to the UNC athletics community, he had no idea how it would be received by his peers.

A few days later, the petition written by the former North Carolina fencer and 2017 UNC and ACC Student-Athlete Advisory Committee Co-President and President, respectively, has been signed by more than 270 current and former UNC athletes who also oppose any plan that would keep Silent Sam on campus.

“As current and former Tar Heels, we love our University and its people,” the letter said. “We love our classmates and teammates, our coaches and our fans. All of them. A monument to those who fought and killed to keep Black people enslaved has no place on our campus. White supremacy has no place on our campus.”

While groups on and off campus have weighed into the controversy surrounding UNC’s fallen Confederate monument this semester, UNC athletes have largely remained silent about the issue until joining the conversation this week.

""I think it's really well written,” said Casey Jacobs, a senior volleyball player who was among the first to sign despite not knowing who wrote it. “I believe every word of it.""

Had the UNC's proposal been approved by the BOG at Friday’s meeting, the monument would have been moved from where it was pulled down on McCorkle Place into a newly-constructed building on the Odum Village site located on South Campus.

Such a move would have situated the statue near the Smith Center, Kenan Memorial Stadium and the Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a building that provides resources to student-athletes, many of whom are Black. The athletes in the open letter stand against bringing the statue closer to the realm of athletics or keeping it on campus at all.

""Whether or not you agree with that perspective, the fact is that the University cannot move forward or thrive and prosper as a diverse institution of higher learning unless it is welcoming to all people,” Baeli-Wang said. “And the presence of Silent Sam on campus makes that impossible.”

‘They don’t have the same love and pride for you’

Moving text by text and Facebook message by message, the petition struck a chord with current athletes more than anyone else.

One of these signees, Katlin Sherman, is a senior sprinter on the track and field team. After hearing about the petition on Wednesday, she knew she wanted to sign it. While Sherman has seen success on and off the track during her time in Chapel Hill, she has also been deeply disturbed by the treatment of Black students at UNC.

“It has honestly been extremely frustrating because we're conflicted since we run and represent the University,” Sherman said. “Just athletes in general, all sports teams, you're put in a place where you really have love and pride for your University, but it seems like they don't have the same love and pride for you. So it just puts us (between) a rock and a hard place"

His group allied with another Al Qaeda splinter group, the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa. By mid-January 2013, the two groups held more than a dozen Western hostages.

In Aménas hostage-taking
On 16 January 2013, in the In Aménas hostage crisis, members of Belmokhtar's new brigade attacked the Tiguentourine gas field near In Aménas, Algeria, and took more than 800 hostages. He justified the attack as a reprisal for the French intervention that had begun in Mali days before.

Algerian forces made an assault and rescued hundreds of hostages. During the conflict, at least 39 hostages were killed, some executed with a bullet to the head by the Brigade. Algerian special forces killed 29 members of the Brigade and captured three, according to the Algerian government. In a video, Belmokhtar claimed responsibility for the attack, saying: ""We are behind the blessed daring operation in Algeria... We did it for al-Qaida"".

British Special Air Service and Special Reconnaissance Regiment special forces, French special forces, and American units were mobilised to locate Belmokhtar. A bounty of $100,000 has been placed on him.

The Origins of

the Cowboy Culture

of Western America

Summary: The culture of the western United States, which many consider the epitome of American-ness, is in origin a synthesis of Anglo and Hispanic cultures which was created in Texas in the days of the Texas Republic and spread with the trail herds to what is now the western United States (and Canada). Major elements of the clothing, food, language and most importantly the cultural values and attitudes derive from Mexican as well as Southern American sources. There were many sources for the population of the western North America but these disparate peoples assimilated the Anglo-Hispanic culture of Texas. Although this culture is perceived as American by the rest of the United States it is a cousin culture rather than a sibling culture and it is just as much a cousin culture for Mexicans as it is for Americans of the eastern and midwestern Unitied States. The ties of the Texan culture to the culture of the southern United States, particularly that of the Scot-Irish of the southern Appalachians, are closer than those to the rest of the United States.

The Origin of Western-style Ranching in Mexico

Cattle ranching is driven by a population's desire to eat beef. When Cortez' conquistadores had completed the conquest of the Aztec and Mayan empires they were rich and powerful beyond their wildest dreams but the local foodstuff lacked the meat they desired. It is small wonder that the importation of cattle was of the highest priority for the conquistadores. Even before Cortez' conquest of the Aztecs of Mexico an expedition led by Gregorio de Villalobos brought cattle to the Panuco River valley near what is today Tampico. Villalobos was later the lieutenant governor of New Spain and coordinated the settlement of Spanish immigrants to Mexico. Along with those immigrants came considerable numbers of horses and cattle. The stock raisers in Hispanola were afraid they would lose their monopoly for the supply of horeses and cattle to the Spanish settlements so they instituted severe restrictions on the delivery of brood stocks to Mexico. Hernan Cortez himself had to petition King Charles V of Spain to get the restrictions lifted. Although all the country from Vera Cruz to Mexico City was suitable for cattle raising Cortez chose to establish a major stock breeding program in the high altitude valley of Mexicalzimgo south of what is now Toluca.

Cold Spring Harbor, NY -- The cerebral cortex of the human brain has been called ""the crowning achievement of evolution."" Ironically, it is so complex that even our greatest minds and most sophisticated science are only now beginning to understand how it organizes itself in early development, and how its many cell types function together as circuits.

A major step toward this great goal in neuroscience has been taken by a team led by Professor Z. Josh Huang, Ph.D., at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). Today they publish research for the first time revealing the birth timing and embryonic origin of a critical class of inhibitory brain cells called chandelier cells, and tracing the specific paths they take during early development into the cerebral cortex of the mouse brain.

These temporal and spatial sequences are regarded by Huang as genetically programmed aspects of brain development, accounting for aspects of the brain that are likely identical in every member of a given species including humans. Exceptions to these stereotypical patterns include irregularities caused by gene mutations or protein malfunctions, both of which are now being identified in people with developmental disorders and neuropsychiatric illnesses.

Chandelier cells were first noticed only 40 years ago, and in the intervening years frustratingly little has been learned about them, beyond the fact that they ""hang"" individually among great crowds of excitatory cells in the cortex called pyramidal neurons, and that their relatively short branches make contact with these excitatory cells. Indeed, a single chandelier cell connects, or ""synapses,"" with as many as 500 pyramidal neurons. Noting this, the great biologist Francis Crick decades ago speculated that chandelier cells exerted some kind of ""veto"" power over the messages being exchanged by the much more numerous excitatory cells in their vicinity.

Born in a previously undiscovered 'country'

After three years of painstaking work that has involved using new technologies to identify and trace neural cell progenitors in ways not previously possible, and to track them as they migrate to positions in the maturing cortex, Huang and colleagues, including Dr. Hiroki Taniguchi now at the Max Planck Florida Institute, have demonstrated that chandelier cells are born in a previously unrecognized portion of the embryonic brain, which they have named the VGZ (ventral germinal zone).

Huang, who has been on a decade-long quest to develop means of learning much more about the cortex's inhibitory cells (sometimes called ""interneurons""), points out that while they are far less numerous than the excitatory pyramidal cells all around them, cells including chandelier cells that inhibit or"

State v. Cardenas


                               Calculation of offender score

9.94A.525(5)(a)(ii). Six of the 14 convictions included in Mr. Cardenas's criminal

history were for crimes committed before July 1, 1986. Of those, the sentences for 4 (2

burglary convictions and 2 theft convictions for crimes committed in June 1986) were

served concurrently and should be counted as a single offense for scoring purposes. The

State agrees that the 4 convictions count as only 1 offense.

       While Mr. Cardenas points to this scoring rule that causes four of his convictions

Timothy Fitzgerald, who developed the EDF guide, acknowledges that the guide does not try to balance risks and benefits. “There’s no widely accepted way to do that, and we tried very hard not to create our own set of equations,” he says.

Mozaffarian disagrees with that approach.

“We have smart, well-meaning scientists who have been educated in this framework, in which you assess risk and come up with tolerable intakes,” he says. But that’s the wrong framework, he says, because you don’t eat pure contaminants, you eat fish, and you can’t get the risks without the benefits.

Setting thresholds

There is another problem with risk-only advisories: the issues with the FDA/EPA safe thresholds for mercury and PCBs. For mercury, that threshold is 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. For a 150-pound person, that would be fewer than seven micrograms a day. Swordfish, one of the most contaminated fish, can have 100 micrograms — two weeks’ allowance — in a 3."

In addition, all patients were considered to have low immunological risk, based on the use of the following exclusion criteria: (1) recipients of ABOc KT; (2) recipients of deceased donor KT; (3) pediatric recipients aged \<18 years; (4) patients with antiphospholipid syndrome; (5) recipients of living donor simultaneous pancreas and KT; (6) patients with preformed donor-specific anti-HLA antibody (DSA); and (7) retransplantation recipients. A single method was used to evaluate DSA in all patients in this study. We identified HLA classes I (A or B) and II (DR) IgG using the FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and a commercially available kit (FlowPRA Single Antigen Beads; One Lambda Inc., Canoga Park, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyushu University (IRB-No 24-54) and was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry System (UMIN000008475). All included patients received full verbal and written explanations of the nature and purpose of this study and provided written informed consent to participate.

Immunosuppression Protocol
--------------------------

All patients who underwent KT were administered 20 mg/d basiliximab at the time of the operation and on postoperative day 4. The orally administered immunosuppressive agents were a once-daily, prolonged-release formulation of tacrolimus (Tac-QD), MMF, EVR, and methylprednisolone. Recipients of ABOi LDKT received oral immunosuppression beginning on preoperative day 14 (described below) and low-dose rituximab (200 mg total) on preoperative day 7.^[@R15]^ They underwent 1--6 plasmapheresis treatments until the anti-A/-B titers were reduced to ≤32, before transplantation.^[@R15]^ No splenectomy or postoperative plasmapheresis was performed. Methylprednisolone (250 mg) was administered intravenously on the day of surgery. In all patients, Tac-QD was initiated at 0.10 mg/kg/d; it was adjusted to maintain a trough concentration of 5--8 ng/mL in the whole blood for 1 or 2 months postoperatively, and a trough concentration of 4--8 ng/mL thereafter. We previously reported that the required doses and trough concentrations tended to decrease in patients receiving Tac-QD, compared with a twice-daily formulation.^[@R16]^ In our institution, the trough concentration has decreased in a manner observed in other institutions.^[@R4],[@R17],[@R18]^ In the EVR group, EVR was started at 2.0 mg/d (beginning on preoperative day 14) and adjusted to target a trough concentration of 3--8 ng/mL throughout the study.^[@R14]^ In the MMF group, MMF was started at 1.0 g/d (beginning on preoperative day 14) and was increased to 2.0 g/d on preoperative day 7. The dose was reduced to 1.5 g/d after 2 months and to 1 g/d after 3 months (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}). CMV prophylaxis was low-dose valganciclovir (450 mg/d) for ≥3 months post KT for all cases in which the donor was CMV-seropositive and the recipient was CMV seronegative.^[@R19]^ For prophylaxis of pneumonia caused by *Pneumocystis jirovecii* (previously known as *Pneumocystis carinii*), all patients received sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for 1 week after transplantation.^[@"
209,13,8843,"A Look At Workplace Policies Meant To Prevent Sexual Harassment

NPR's Robert Siegel talks to attorney Amy Oppenheimer about what kinds of policies can prevent sexual harassment in the workplace — and whether the ones already implemented have done any good.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Will anything change in the workplace as a result of all these revelations of sexual harassment? We posed that question to Amy Oppenheimer. She's a lawyer and investigator based in Berkeley, Calif., who specializes in preventing and responding to harassment and discrimination. We began our discussion by talking about what she would have expected to change since the Supreme Court mandated nearly 20 years ago that every sexual harassment allegation must be investigated.

AMY OPPENHEIMER: You wouldn't expect to see the level of sexual harassment and sexual assault and abuse that is still prevalent. And I think that when you're talking about matters of gender issues and sexual issues, they're much harder to get at when you combine it with power, that obviously the law isn't enough, that people really do need to stand up and behave differently and make sure that the people around them are behaving differently.

SIEGEL: Many companies use online video training for their employees. Are those effective ways to educate employees about what is and what is not appropriate at the workplace?

OPPENHEIMER: Well, online training is not usually very interactive. Occasionally I've seen good online training, but most of it is not great. And there's an open question as to whether training really is effective and what training, something that the Department of Fair Employment and Housing in California is looking at now through a task force I'm working with - is the efficacy of training. We've had it mandated in California for over 10 years, and we're not sure how well it works.

SIEGEL: I'm assuming that by working, what we mean is it makes sexual harassment less likely. I guess another measure of its working is it protects the employer from being held liable for any sexual harassment that takes place. They could say, hey, we have training; we have videos; everyone had to answer 30 questions about this.

OPPENHEIMER: Well, I think of working as that people feel that they can complain and they know what to complain about and that their complaints will be taken seriously. And so obviously the training doesn't mean that the complaints are taken seriously necessarily. But there's always going to be people who misbehave. The question is, how do employers respond to it? And do employees feel that they can speak up? What's more important than training is what kind of role models there are, what kind of action is actually taken when people do speak up.

SIEGEL: Can there be rules that eradicate sexual harassment in the workplace when, as you've said, this also involves power - power relationships between senior people who are more powerful than the junior people who might be worried that if they report a case of harassment, their careers will suffer for it?

OPPENHEIMER: Yeah. I mean you just pointed out a really important issue, which is a lot of the people who are abusing the rules are people who do have more power than those who are enforcing them. And if you don't have people who are enforcing them who have more power, then inevitably you're not going to have the kind of change that we would want to see.

SIEGEL: In all of the waves of stories that we've been hearing and seeing and reading over the past few weeks, are there things that have greatly surprised you, or is this what you do every week and what you encounter in your work all the time?

OPPENHEIMER: I think really what has surprised me most is that so many voices now are speaking up about it. It is hopeful that that could lead to a real change. I think that we know that there are serious harassment and sexual assault situations with very powerful men that go on that we don't hear about. And suddenly people are talking about it, and that really could mean that the future might look a little different.

SIEGEL: Amy Oppenheimer, thank you very much for talking with us today.

OPPENHEIMER: Thank you for having me.

SIEGEL: Amy Oppenheimer is an employment lawyer and investigator. She's based in Berkeley, Calif., and spoke to us from Clovis, Calif.

Making Memories: Our Christmas Eve Open House #NikonMOMents

One of my most-anticipated annual traditions is the Christmas Eve Open House. When I was a kid, Christmas Eve was one of my favourite nights of the year. Mom would make appetizers and sweets and friends would drop in to visit and enjoy tea or drinks. I loved the Christmas tree, the visitors, the tasty goodies and the nearness of Santa's arrival.

I was thrilled when it was once again our turn to host the Christmas Eve Open House this year. Of course, there is a lot of preparation involved - cleaning, planning appetizers and baking cookies. It's always a matter of achieving your goals for the evening without tiring yourself out so much that you won't enjoy your guests. I think we usually manage to finish our list of chores about the time guests are expected at the door. I took this picture of Ace, above, right in that beautiful moment when the house is ready and nobody has arrived yet.

It was a busy day, but I made sure to snap some photos as it progressed. I always think it's nice to have recorded memories of special family moments. As a Nikon Mom, I also want to share a few tips about how to use your digital SLR camera to your advantage on occasions such as Christmas Eve.

Earlier in the day, I photographed the lovely sugar cookies that my daughter and her cousin helped to make and decorate. With plenty of natural light available by the window, this is my favourite kind of photo to take. All that's needed is a couple of moments to arrange your goodies on a table by the window. Easy peasy.

Once evening hits and the natural light is no longer available, things become slightly more complex. Sure you can use a flash, but that's not my preference. I'd rather capture some of the ambiance in the room from lighting and candles. Fortunately the Nikon D3300 makes it easy to photograph any occasion in any lighting. While the manual setting might seem intimidating at first, once you learn a few simple adjustments it's really a lot more fun than using auto. A simple touch of the camera's ""i"" button allows you to adjust features such as the ISO sensitivity to get more light. While I normally keep the camera at an ISO of 100, it can be set up to 12800 or even Hi1. It takes me back to pre-digital days when I would buy higher ISO film to photograph concerts and events. The higher you go, the more light you can get (but your subject also gets a little grainier).

You can also adjust the camera's ""exposure compensation"" from -5 to +5, with +5 being the brightest. This is another way to grab some extra light for your subject, as I did for this photo of my daughter in her party dress. Let's face it, there are a myriad of camera functions you simply can't access with a cellphone cam.

If you just don't feel like figuring all that out, one of my favourite features of the Nikon D3300 is the Guide mode. You simply turn the dial to ""Guide"" and then select ""Shoot."" From there you can pick ""Advanced operation"" and choose from pre-set options such as ""capture reds in sunsets,"" ""take bright photos"" or ""take dark (low key) photos."" The camera takes care of the programming for you. That's always nice.

Then you can capture a few quick photos of all your great friends and family before sitting down to have a chat and some treats yourself. I like to do a round of picture-taking when guests are first settled with their drinks, so I can be sure I've caught those special memories ""on film"" right away. (It's easy to forget later when you are enjoying the company!)

I also try to capture the important moments of the night, not the least of which is the emergence of the Christmas cookies!

And that moment when the kiddos change into their fresh, new Christmas pajamas.

And, of course, when a (very funny) uncle reads ""'Twas The Night Before Christmas"" before everyone heads off to bed to await Santa's visit. (And that's when Mommy finally gets to put on her fresh, new Christmas"

Entries with the tag: thomas greiss

Some ex-Worcester Shuttle frequent flyers have been on the move lately, and for some reason this is as interesting to me as pre-game thoughts about the Sharks in Anaheim. I have only one thought about tonight's game: the Sharks need to avenge that near loss they suffered at home on the 29th. I just hope it isn't with a near win like the Ducks got. Something on the order of a regulation win would be better.

Reports say Greiss will start, and Boyle missed the morning skate again due to lingering flu symptoms:

@PollakOnSharks: McLellan says Boyle missed practice because of flu symptoms, but should play. Note: #SJSharks coach said same when teams met 1/29. Hmm.

@PollakOnSharks: To be precise (and fair), #SJSharks McLellan said of Boyle that he ""antcipates him playing.""

Precise and fair it is. I did wonder if playing while sick or after just being sick would be a bad idea. I'll dwell on how perfectly rational that explanation is instead of getting all worked up about it. Right.

Over the past few days, I discovered an impatience I haven't felt for a while, the ""hold on, no games today? Or tomorrow? Or... I'm supposed to wait how long for a game?"" feeling. It was irritating, but not bad. It reminded me of a normal hockey season. It feels like being all adapted to the new hockey universe.

This impatience drove me to start hunting for European and KHL games online. This is not only difficult because feeds tend to move around, but also because an audio feed will not do. I don't speak most of the languages these games are broadcast in. I did manage to dig up a Dinamo Minsk game going on yesterday morning. A video feed was not available to me (which only took me about an hour to figure out) but following the scoreboard was better than nothing. So that was fun, except that Minsk blew a lead and fell 6-3. At least Pavelski got a goal.

There are several Sharks abroad. I found the following information online, but I can't be sure how complete it is. I started with Eurohockey.com because they have an easy search that found most of the Sharks quickly. From there I sort of wandered:

If you’ve been following Twitter news about Alex Stalock, you might wonder why the Sharks would fly Sexsmith all the way out here and send Nitty back to Worcester instead of just bringing Stalock over from Stockton. Sure, Sexsmith is higher in the depth chart but all that to and fro air travel is hardly a sound ecological strategy. Luckily, I stumbled on an answering machine tape out in Stockton that recorded this recent phone call:

There’s dragons and there’s Dragons. That Sharks @ Oilers game wasn’t what I had in mind to start the Year of the Dragon. There were some good things, like Logan Couture earned his 100th NHL point. The Sharks did control much of the game. They just couldn’t score accordingly, so they lost.

Luck and legend distinguish the Dragon from the other symbols in the Chinese and Mongolian zodiac. It is said to be the very luckiest birth year, the sign of the emperor. Unlike the other symbols, a dragon is not the sort of critter most of us will see in our lifetimes. Since there are twelve signs in this system, that is a little surprising. The year starts today and ends around this time in 2013.

As someone who grew up in San Francisco, I guess I should say something about the Niners. They lost. Bummer for Niners fans. I wasn’t all that anxious for them to win because I feel that trips to championship finals disperse geographically in such a way that if the Niners had gone on, this would have been bad news for the Sharks. Look what happened with the Giants- the other Giants I mean. Condolences to Niners fans, may the loss not be in vain.

The Sharks begin the year in Edmonton. I don’t know if any of them attended a parade, but a big spectacle like an NHL game should do. Wow… that would be cool, if someone brought a paper and silk dragon to the game and sent it around the stands… I know, that probably won’t happen.

After sleeping on it and reading Sharks game recaps, I realized that there were a lot of good things about last night’s game against the Ducks. Things like allowing no shots on goal during penalty kills. Things like out shooting and out"
217,2,2228,"There are a lot of different type of headphones… theres closed back headphones, open back headphones, audiophile grade headphones, and active noise canceling headphones. But theres a special type of headphones for a special type of person that absolute loves bass. And thats bass head headphones. And today we’re comparing the Skullcandy Crusher 360’s against the ever so popular Sony MDR-XB950N1, which arguably has been the best Basshead headphones on the market for awhile now.

The Sony XB950N1 came out in January of 2017 and they retail for $250. Where as the Skullcandy Crusher 360’s were released in September of 2018 and retail for $300. Now I’m fully aware that for this type of money you can also go ahead and pick up more premium ANC headphones like the Sony 1000XM3 or the Bose QC35 Series Two. But in short, Bass Head headphones are kind of like sports cars, they might not be as practical… but they’re a lot of fun. So if you want to pick either of these headphones up I’ll have links in the description below and if you use the links it really helps out the channel. I highly suggest you check them out cause Sony headphones routinely go on sale you so you’ll might get lucky. And if you want to learn more about either of these headphones then please watch their full reviews. And also check out the new merch shelf down below.

First lets get the simple stuff out of the way, and thats the included accessories and ports. The Skullcandy Crusher 360’s come included with a hard shell carrying case which is a big step up from the carrying pouch that comes included with the Sony XB950N1’s. And I find it kind of ironic cause since the crusher’s are built like a tank they don’t really need a case, where as since the Sony’s are a little more delicate I usually worry about them any time I have them in my back pack. The crusher’s also come included with a much better quality audio cable with an inline controller and a high quality micro usb cable for charging. Now both of these headphones have a very easy to reach 3.5 millimeter audio jack which is good and they both charge via a micro USB port. But like I said in the full review, I feel that since the Skullcandy Crusher 360 were released in late 2018 they should have of had came with a USB C port instead.

Now lets talk about these headphone’s design and build quality, cause they’re very different from one another. Like I mentioned earlier, the crushers are built like a tank. The headband and ear cups have a soft touch feel to them, they have a metal frame, and the faux leather on the earcups and headband feels much more premium compared to the faux leather used on the Sony’s. The Sony’s are mostly made"

Can I offer my reputation points to the user from whom I've received a bounty on an answer which did not solve the issue completely?

I feel a bounty was awarded to me incorrectly here. Though I did jump into the answer with the best of my ability, the problem was not actually resolved. I do understand most of the bounty system but, my question is, can I voluntarily return the whole, half or at least a token sum to the user who offered the bounty, since the problem was never resolved?
I feel like I fell into/through a technical loophole on this.  It's kind of a nervous tick thing with me and it will keep bugging me. Alternately, would a better solution be for me to delete my answer?

A:

As I mentioned already in the comments,

Don't delete your answer unless it's not useful. It has three upvotes
  and the OP may have rewarded you the bounty since you have put your
  efforts into solving the question or the bounty was going to expire. I
  don't think its mistakenly rewarded. Even your answer doesn't solve
  the OP's problem it can still be useful for him and other future
  readers. Your answer becomes a solution only when it is accepted by
  the OP. So I guess you're okay there.

A:

[Can] I voluntarily return the whole, half or at least a token sum to the user who offered the bounty[?]

As far as I know, you cannot give your reputation directly to someone else. It would game the system if such a provision exists. People, when they feel extremely generous to  a user, tends to serially upvote that user's posts. This is also considered an illegitimate act in the network which shouldn't be considered either.
Besides, the act of having that bounty ended up in your account doesn't seem to be a technical loophole but a manual act by OP himself. 

Since your answer had three upvotes during the time bounty was active, your answer was already eligible for automatic (half) bounty by Community ♦ user and possibly would've been awarded if OP couldn't have offered it  manually until the grace period ended.
What's more? I believe OP did the right thing. Bounties should be awarded to answers which either solved the issue or to those whom the community has upvoted well. It is not mandatory though. 
Beska has written here:

If the person doesn't want to accept an answer, because their problem isn't yet solved, then award the bounty to the highest rated answer as normal, but don't auto-accept an answer. Then the questioner could hope for more answers, put up more information, perhaps a second higher bounty, etc.

There are conflicting answers as well. See them here: Why do I always have to accept an answer at the end of the bounty period?.
Now, coming to the point. You can choose to offer a chunk of your reputation points to a user, yet not violating the policies of network, by choosing to offer a bounty to an exemplary answer of that user (a direct transfer) or by offering a bounty on that user's question. The latter wouldn't transfer the points but would help that user greatly. To avoid abuse of system, if you choose the former technique, you would have to wait for 24 hours to award the bounty.
OP in this case doesn't seem to have any answer posted on the site, let alone one to be considered exemplary, so you can't go for the former technique. Only option left would be to help him out by using the latter technique. 

Alternately would a better solution be for me to delete my answer?

As mentioned by Lucky, you shouldn't and need not to delete the post, although I'm not sure whether you can simply delete an answer or would have to vote and wait for it to reviewed, in case it is an upvoted answer. 
I believe you shouldn't be having that honesty part troubling you anymore, now that it is clear in my reasoning noted above. I would like you to note that your answer falls in the category of the answers termed as partial answer. Help center states here:

Help us find a solution by researching the problem, then contribute the results of your research and anything additional you’ve tried as a partial answer. That way, even if"
223,11,29807," her first point for reversal, Post argues that she is without an adequate remedy to challenge the Board's unlawful actions, and we should therefore interpret section 7-5-701(a)(1) as creating a third type of action in election cases allowing her to challenge the Board's certification of results. See, e.g., Willis v. Crumbly, 368 Ark. 5, 10-11, 242 S.W.3d 600, 604 (2006) (recognizing ""two types of election cases provided for by statute: pre-election, eligibility challenges and post-election, election contests""). In essence, Post asks this court to construe the election code to fashion a remedy for her.
This second appeal is but another attempt to achieve the same objective as that of the first appeal. However, the decision of this court in the first appeal is now the law of the case, as the circuit *598 court correctly observed. In the first appeal, Post sought to challenge Zolliecoffer's eligibility and certification as the winner. In the second appeal, Post seeks the same objective, which is to prevent the votes for Zolliecoffer from being certified. These issues were decided adversely to Post in the first appeal. They are now the law of the case. Scamardo v. Sparks Reg'l Med. Ctr., 375 Ark. 300, 289 S.W.3d 903 (2008). The law-of-the-case doctrine prohibits a court from reconsidering issues of law and fact that have already been or could have been presented in the first appeal. Id. In as much as Post is still challenging Zolliecoffer's eligibility and the certification of him as the winner, the circuit court was correct in recognizing as the law of the case that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction. Zolliecoffer, 371 Ark. 263, 265 S.W.3d 114 (citing Pederson v. Stracener, 354 Ark. 716, 128 S.W.3d 818 (2003)). Thus, we affirm the circuit court's order dismissing Post's petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
We next consider Post's second argument for reversal. She contends the circuit court erroneously granted the Board an additional fifteen days from the entry of its order to certify the votes cast in the 2006 Altus mayoral election. Section 7-5-701(a)(1) states as follows:
No earlier than forty-eight (48) hours after the election and no later than the fifteenth calendar day after the election, the county board of election commissioners, from the certificates and ballots received from the several precincts, shall proceed to ascertain, declare, and certify the result of the election to the Secretary of State.
Post contends the circuit court is without authority to allow the Board's certification beyond this statutorily prescribed period. Zolliecoffer responds that Post should be estopped from claiming that the Board cannot now certify results because it was her action in obtaining the order that prohibited the timely certification in the first place.
We first observe that the circuit court correctly interpreted this"

First a disclaimer.

This story almost seems like it could be a hoax. Trump supporter says COVID-19 is no big deal and then dies of the virus. I haven’t found an obituary yet, but there are screenshots and a GoFundMe. Once I can 100% this is not some hoax, I will remove the disclaimer.

This is almost just too on-the-nose. That a Trump supporter named “Karen” died of the “liberal hoax” she dismissed in a Facebook post days earlier.

—-

About two weeks ago, Karen Kolb Sehlke posted a rant on Facebook claiming the COVID-19 pandemic was “media driven” and “controlled by the radical people in powerful places.”

More from Political Flare

There was also a #Trump2020 hashtag in there, along with the claim that “this is what socialism looks like.”

She said abortion was far more serious a problem. She declared the government response the “beginning of socialism.” And she acted like the stock market’s crash was part of that plan.

Kolb Sehlke posted a rather long screed on Facebook about the virus being a hoax:

Here’s another one where she says, “You don’t need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns!”

Sehlke died this week, apparently of COVID-19. And it’s tragic.

She reportedly died on April 2nd. I have not found an obituary yet, but basing the information from the GoFundMe the family set up.

The GoFundMe page on her behalf explained how she tested positive for the virus and it “caused her to go into Kidney failure and septic shock.” But perhaps after her hypocrisy came to light, the page was revised to remove those references, before being disabled altogether (maybe to avoid comments).

For skeptics who asked for further proof this isn’t a hoax, I get it. It’s just too on-the-nose that a Trump supporter named “Karen” died of the “liberal hoax” she dismissed in a FB post days earlier.

As that Twitter user rightly says, the point isn’t to mock someone’s death. It’s to emphasize how serious this pandemic is. The people trying to defend Trump’s irresponsibility by downplaying the virus aren’t just hurting themselves; they could hurt all of us.

Stop listening to them and stop voting for Republicans. It’s a matter of public health at this point.

… and the internet (predictably) exploded.

And just to be clear, I agree that what Miley did was frankly disgusting, but not for the reasons that you might think.

Most of the criticism of Miley’s VMA performance has focussed on her attire and dancing style, with people claiming that her dress (or rather, state of undress) and sexual movements were vulgar, degrading and slutty. Quite a few people mentioned that her parents must be ashamed; there was a lot of discussion about how sad it was that sweet, innocent Hannah Montana had come to this. I saw a lot of derisive remarks about how Miley wants attention at any cost; some even went so far to say that Miley is sick and that this behaviour was a cry for help.

Then, this morning, I watched a fuckton of white feminists totally ignore the racist aspects of what Miley did in their rush to defend her from slut-shaming.

Now, let’s be clear: there was definitely a lot of slut-shaming going on, and it was really fucking disgusting. But what was equally disgusting was white feminists’ silence over Miley’s minstrel show.

What Miley is doing is cultural appropriation. She, a wealthy white woman, is taking elements from black culture in order to achieve a specific image. Her status as a member of a traditionally oppressive race and class means that she is able to pick and choose what parts of black culture she wants to embrace without having to deal with the racism and racialization that black women live with every day. In short, she can imagine that she is being “ghetto” without having any concept of what living in a ghetto would really mean.

Miley is doing her best to promote herself as a part of rachet culture, which Jody Rosen describes as “the potent sexual symbolism of black female bodies,” while simultaneously treating the black women in her videos and performances as props. She is taking elements of black culture and using them to give her the patina of street cred that she wants so badly. She is playing at being black without even trying to understand what the lived experience of being black really is. She is appropriating cultural elements without taking any time to reflect on her position of privilege and how her use of the term “ratchet” or her twerking are contributing to the oppression of black people.

Even worse, in her performance last night Miley used black women as props – like, literal props – and barely anyone said anything. I saw very few people displaying any outrage over the fact that Miley was, at one point, slapping a faceless black woman on the ass as if she was nothing more than a thing for Miley to dominate and humiliate. I saw barely anyone discussing the fact that Miley’s sexual empowerment, or whatever you want to call it, should not come at the cost of degrading black women. I saw a whole lot of people giving Miley a pass for her behaviour because she’s young and naive and sheltered.

I saw many prominent white feminists use their sizeable platforms to defend Miley’s right to rub her ass on Robin Thicke while wearing flesh-coloured bra and panties. I watched as those same people remained embarrassingly silent about Miley’s behaviour towards black women and black culture.

You click on it, expecting an interactive chat but what you actually get is a

frustrating to use even when they're made properly.

People don't want chatbots - businesses want(ed) them because they offer(ed)
the promise of much cheaper support. Of course that's predicated on them
working _at all_, which in practice they don't, obviously. Think that message
has filtered through enough now that the hype surge that was in full swing a
couple of years ago seems to have petered out again.

For some use cases, customers like them very much indeed.

I guess customers want them to the extent they help them achieve their task
without hassle and/or them realising it's a chatbot, pretty much just as well
as a human would.

229,7,17205,"Doctors are calling for people to consult with their physicians to deal with potentially deadly ectopic pregnancies instead of following the advice of an article published on the conservative website, The Federalist, on Monday, which claimed that procedures to save the lives of pregnant people were unnecessary. An ectopic pregnancy or EP occurs when a fertilized egg implants in a place other than inside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube, which can rupture if the pregnancy continues.

In the piece—titled “Is Abortion Really Necessary For Treating Ectopic Pregnancies?”— Federalist correspondent Georgi Boorman also claims that EPs contribute to abortion rates, and demanded an end to all legal abortion, including for treatment of EP. ""Abortion is never the answer,"" she writes.

Medical experts say an EP always ends in pregnancy loss, either on its own (a miscarriage) or because of an intervention to end the nonviable pregnancy. The complication impacts approximately one out of 100 pregnancies, and is the leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester due to internal bleeding. Between 1980 and 2007, 876 people died from an EP in the United States. Black women were disproportionately represented in those figures: Their mortality rates were 6.8 times higher than white women.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, there are two treatments for ectopic pregnancy: medication to stop the pregnancy or surgery to remove it and sometimes portions of the fallopian tube. In both, the goal is to end the nonviable pregnancy—effectively a termination, though OB/GYNs point out that if a fetus isn't viable it's not considered an abortion—in order to protect the person from potentially facing life-threatening hemorrhaging. As the Mayo Clinic explains, “An ectopic pregnancy can't proceed normally. The fertilized egg can't survive, and the growing tissue may cause life-threatening bleeding, if left untreated.”

Yet Boorman argues in the Federalist that “we owe it to mothers and their babies to examine how severe and how common this threat to her life and health really is, and if there are other ways to ensure her safety that don’t include killing the child.” Too often, she says, doctors limit “patients' options, and move forward with hasty interventions that lower their risk of getting sued.”

Astoundingly, Boorman suggests that the risk of serious injury and death due to an EP diagnosis may be exaggerated. Referencing a 2012 paper published in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care, she writes that many ectopic deaths in the late 90s and early 2000s in the United Kingdom were ultimately attributed to misdiagnosis. There’s no way, Boorman says, to know if those women would have lost their lives had a doctor correctly diagnosed an EP and chosen to closely monitor the pregnancy until it ended on its own or required intervention.

The article also implies that people diagnosed with EP would be better off rupturing a fallopian tube and experiencing internal bleeding than choosing to terminate the pregnancy. Boorman references a procedure called autotransfusion (where a person receives their own blood for a transfusion) as having “a higher success rate than the most commonly employed abortive method.” Why does she suggest this? Because, she writes, putting one’s life at risk is preferable to “purposely destroying your own child.” Besides, she adds, “If left alone, a small minority of babies will reimplant in a safer location (such as on top of the tube) between weeks 5 and 10 and continue developing.”

The odds of a successful ectopic pregnancy are actually extremely rare—and cannot happen if the fertilized egg has implanted in the fallopian tube, which happens in more than 90 percent of EP cases.

It’s not the first time that those opposed to abortion have used inaccurate information regarding EPs as a way to advance their agenda that termination is never medically necessary. In May, an Ohio lawmaker garnered criticism from the medical community for introducing legislation that referenced a nonexistent treatment for EP that would “reimplant the fertilized ovum into the pregnant woman's uterus.”

231,6,5009,"Master class: Power & Participation in the Age of Big Data

The Datafication of the Public Sphere

Social media, such as Twitter, Facebook or YouTube, were initially developed to capitalize on targeted advertising and user data analysis. Deeply intertwined with traditional media and the so-called blogosphere, social media constitute a new arena for political debate. Deprived of traditional editorial control, they inherently blur the private and the public, emotional gut reaction and informed debate. The public sphere now effectively extends through networked media: new layers of social interaction and novel forms of civic participation, political campaign and debate, new distribution channels and new means of communication.

Most importantly, these platforms record every click users make, every comment users post, their every interaction. This 'datafication' constitutes a data layer, a quickly growing repository of all comments, posts and social interactions within social media, providing an unprecedented analytical basis for polling, campaigning, editing and governing. It also produces novel means for control and surveillance. This 'governmentality' renders social media into tightly monitored platforms contradicting the traditional understanding of civic participation in exchanging information and forming opinion.

Datafication and governmentality affect largely the possibilities for participation in the networked public sphere and as such they are a challenge for our future democracy. However, the working mechanisms of these platforms remain largely opaque. This masterclass responds to the challenge of opening the 'black box' of algorithmic governance and discusses the opportunities and limits of participation.

A Masterclass on Power and Participation

This masterclass discusses research proposals related to connected media, participation and governance. It aims at developing frameworks for conceptual and empirical understanding of the profound transformation that affects most aspects of everyday life through the emerging data practices. In an interdisciplinary effort we will revisit concepts of participation and discuss research methods for unraveling power asymmetries. We invite participants from (but not limited to) media studies, communication studies, urban planning, architecture, political sciences and the arts who are conducting research that touches upon issues of power, participation and governance. During the masterclass, participants will engage in discussing research projects and developing methods and theoretical concepts. Prior to the masterclass, participants will be provided with a syllabus andreading list.

Symposium: The Datafication of the Public Sphere

This masterclass is part of the symposium “The Datafication of the Public Sphere"", a transdisciplinary event on theory and practice of smartphone use and related digital tools. The symposion (May 07 - 09 May 2015) deals with the impact of rapidly diffusing, continuously and quickly changing processes of a society transforming through digitization. Which strategies of appropriation and subversion remain to foster the vision of an elucidated and democratic society? What are possible roles for art to play in this effort?

Together with the symposium, the AIL (Angewandte Innovation Lab) hosts the performative installation bastard_crowd_mobile. It revolves around the everyday use of smartphones. These gadgets rapidly diffuse on a global scale and support the datafication of the public sphere bei delivering data of all kind via their internet connections to social networks and service providers. Bastard_crowding is introducing an artistic practice for intervening locally in Europe as well as in Asia and Africa in order to make the ambiguity of technology visible and discuss media practices in local environments.

How to participate?

The masterclass takes place on may 08 and 09 2015 from 10 am until 1 pm. Participants receive a full pass for the entire symposium and are invited to actively participate in the other sessions.

The masterclass is limited to 12 participants. Candidates are required to apply with a brief letter of motivation and to attach a CV and a brief summary of their research projects or their research interest.

Positioned in “DPR”-controlled Donetsk city between 21:40hrs on 17 March and 02:17hrs on 18 March the SMM heard 44 undetermined explosions and five bursts of small-arms fire 3-10km north and north-west of its position[2]. From a position at “DPR”-controlled Donetsk railway station (6km north-west of Donetsk city centre), between 07:30 and 15:00hrs, the SMM heard three bursts of small-arms fire 3-4km north of its position.

Whilst in government-controlled Svitlodarsk (57km north-east of Donetsk), between 16:43 and 21:40hrs on 17 March, the SMM heard 41 undetermined explosions in areas 2-3km south-east and 4-5km north-east of its position. From the same location between 17:30 and 22:22hrs on 18 March the SMM heard 196 undetermined explosions and over 200 shots of small-arms and heavy-machine-gun fire in an area 2-3km south-east.

In “DPR”-controlled Horlivka (39km north-east of Donetsk) between 19:00 and 21:38hrs on 17 March, the SMM saw and heard outgoing fire and saw flashes from unknown weapons, 11 undetermined explosions, eight mortar impacts and one burst of heavy-machine-gun fire all in areas ranging from west to north-east 0.2 to 13km of its position.

On 17 March between 16:11 and 16:19hrs the SMM camera in Shyrokyne (20km east of Donetsk) recorded several impacts and detonations approximately 1.4km north-east and four undetermined explosions in the early hours of 19 March.

In Luhansk region on 18 March between 17:10-18:50hrs, while in “LPR”-controlled Stakhanov (50km west of Luhansk), the SMM heard an intense exchange of fire involving approximately 200 detonations and explosions from artillery, automatic grenade launcher (AGL) and heavy-machine-gun bursts in an area 10-12km west-north-west. The SMM also heard a number of ceasefire violations which were assessed as training exercises in areas outside the security zone.

The SMM monitored adherence to the ceasefire on both sides of the contact line to enable work to continue at the water filtration station near “DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata (16km north-east of Donetsk). The SMM escorted Voda Donbassa workers to the water filtration station where a piece of unexploded ordnance remained at the entrance. Another SMM patrol, stationary at a temporary observation post 4.1km west-south-west of Yasynuvata at 10:45hrs, were approached by four “DPR” members who ordered the SMM to leave*, citing orders from the “minister of defence”.

[**ABSTRACT**]{}

Using the Moon to occult the Sun, the Clementine spacecraft used its navigation cameras to map the inner zodiacal light at optical wavelengths over elongations of $3\lesssim\epsilon\lesssim30^\circ$ from the Sun. This surface brightness map is then used to infer the spatial distribution of interplanetary dust over heliocentric distances of about 10 solar radii to the orbit of Venus. The averaged ecliptic surface brightness of the zodiacal light falls off as $Z(\epsilon)\propto\epsilon^{-2.45\pm0.05}$ which suggests that the dust cross–sectional density nominally falls off as $\sigma(r)\propto r^{-1.45\pm0.05}$. The interplanetary dust also has an albedo of $a\simeq0.1$ that is uncertain by a factor of $\sim2$. Asymmetries of $\sim10\%$ are seen in directions east–west and north–south of the Sun, and these may be due the giant planets’ secular gravitational perturbations.

We apply a simple model that attributes the zodiacal light as due to three dust populations having distinct inclination distributions, namely, dust from asteroids and Jupiter–family comets (JFCs) having characteristic inclinations of $i\sim7^\circ$, dust from Halley–type comets having $i\sim33^\circ$, and an isotropic cloud of dust from Oort Cloud comets. The best–fitting scenario indicates that asteroids + JFCs are the source of about $45\%$ of the optical dust cross–section seen in the ecliptic at 1 AU, but that at least $89\%$ of the dust cross–section enclosed by a 1 AU radius sphere is of a cometary origin. Each population’s radial density variations can also deviate somewhat from the nominal $\sigma(r)\propto r^{-1.45}$. When these results are extrapolated out to the asteroid belt,"

The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a MOS transistor device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a self-aligned contact (SAC).
2. Description of Related Art
The conventional method of manufacturing a self-aligned contact includes the steps of forming spacers on the sidewalls of a polysilicon gate structure, wherein the spacer is an insulating layer such as a silicon oxide layer. Then, a second insulating layer is formed over the gate structure, and subsequently the second insulating layer is etched to form a self-aligned contact. The spacers protect the gate structure against any damage during the etching operation. Finally, conductive material, for example, polysilicon or tungsten, is deposited into the contact to form a conductive layer, and then metal silicide is deposited to lower the resistance of the conductive layer further.
FIGS. 1A through 1E are cross-sectional views showing the progression of manufacturing steps in producing a self-aligned contact according to a conventional method.
First, as shown in FIG. 1A, a substrate 100 is provided. The substrate 100 can be a lightly doped P-well or a P-type semiconductor, for example. Next, a gate structure 102 is formed over the substrate 100. The gate structure 102 is formed by first depositing a gate oxide layer 104 over the substrate 100, and then forming a conductive stack layer 106 over the gate oxide layer 104. The conductive stack layer 106 is formed by first depositing a doped polysilicon layer (not shown) over the gate oxide layer 104, and then forming a metal silicide layer (not shown) over the doped polysilicon layer. For example, the gate oxide layer 104 can be formed by heating the substrate 100 to a temperature of about 800-1000.degree. C. in an oxygen-filled atmosphere. The doped polysilicon layer of the conductive stack layer 106 can be formed by a deposition process using a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method. In general, impurities for the doped polysilicon layer including arsenic or phosphorus are deposited concurrently with the polysilicon deposition. Alternatively, the impurities can be implanted after a polysilicon layer is formed. The metal silicide layer of the conductive stack layer 106, for example, can be tungsten silicide, titanium silicide or molybdenum silicide. After the gate structure 102 is formed, an ion implantation operation is carried out to form a lightly doped source/drain region 110. For example, using the gate structure 102 as a mask, N-type ions such as arsenic or phosphorus are implanted into the substrate 100.
Next, as shown in FIG. 1B, an insulating layer 114 is formed over the substrate 100 using, for example, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The insulating layer 114 can be a silicon oxide layer or a silicon nitride layer, for example.
Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 1C, the insulating layer 114 is anisotropically etched back to form spacers 114a on the sidewalls of the gate structure 102. Consequently, a portion of the lightly doped source/drain region 110 is exposed and a self-aligned contact opening 122 is formed above the source/drain region 110. The spacers 114a not only protect the gate structure"

4. Natural language specification, e.g. lang=”en”is optional, but recommended, as it allows search engines and screen readers to identify section correctly. Specifying language for html tag defines it for entire page, however it also can be specified for elements, such as div.

5. Stylesheet definition does not require type=”text/css” specification, since “rel” (relationship) defines link as stylesheet, and css is the only style sheet language.

6. Similarly, no need to specify language=”JavaScript” for script tag: JavaScript is assumed by default.

7. Closing </script> tag is required, even when referring an external JavaScript file.

8. Comment <!– saved from url=(0014)about:internet –> is only required to enable debugging of local page in IE; if not specified, when you load local page, IE prevents running any JavaScript on the page, unless you explicitely click “Allow blocked content” (this comment is ignored by any other browser)

9. Tags can be lower and/or upper case.

10. Attributes can be specified without values (e.g. <input type=”checkbox” checked>). This is not commonly used, however, since inconsistent with other attributes. XHTML standard required value for each attribute (e.g. <input type=”checkbox” checked=”checked” />).

12. Quotation marks around attribute values are only required if attribute values contain >, = or space. E.g. “<img alt=”This is an image” src=image.gif> is valid for HTML5, but not XHTML.

Loose rules 9-12 are likely to fail on validators. It also may be considered a bad “not-so-clean” style. From the browser perspective, however, those inconsistencies do not add any overhead, and thus following XHTML rules is not necessary from performance or compatibility perspective.

In essence Firefox profile encapsulates user information: bookmarks, cookies, history, private information, e.g. passwords and so on. Which makes them very useful in many occasions, e.g.

Different people sharing the same computer and not willing to create different users on operating system level. Especially with blooming social networks, blogs and other sites where logging in is required, it’s much easier to keep different profiles, than log-out and log-in each time, to each site.

Even for the same person who is using the same machine for different purposes, this feature can allow to separate the roles of the machine, from web browsing perspective, e.g. “home”, “work”, etc.

Sometimes creating separate profile is also good when working on a specific project which requires a large amount of bookmarks, which can be deleted once the project is complete.

Finally profiles are very useful in testing, as they allow to simulate different users without the pain of creating different sessions on OS level

Without further configuration Firefox usese a default profile (in early versions of Firefox you could see it every time you opened a browser). In Firefox 2 or 3, however, you need to start Profile Manager purposely to see the profile you are using and to create/delete additional profiles.

The switch is not case-sensitive, thus you can type -profilemanager. And in addition you can use -p or -P switch: their meaning is slightly different, according to the command line reference, but they open the same Profile Manager anyways. Usually there’s no need to specify the full path to Firefox (e.g. C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\). With -ProfileManager switch alone, Profile Manager will only start if you don’t have another instance of Firefox running. Thus

![Abdominal radiograph demonstrating a ventriculoperitoneal shunt fracture with migration of the proximal catheter out of the peritoneum.](jsls-10-1-122-g02){#F2}

Two (18%) patients had laparoscopic confirmation of a functioning catheter in a satisfactory position, requiring no revision **([Figure 3](#F3){ref-type=""fig""})**. One (9%) patient had the initial VP shunt inserted with laparoscopic assistance due to obesity.

![Intraoperative photo demonstrating a functional ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter with cerebrospinal fluid exiting the catheter, requiring no revision.](jsls-10-1-122-g03){#F3}

Operative time for laparoscopy ranged from 30 minutes to 60 minutes and was performed concurrently with the neurosurgery team. No peritoneal complications during laparoscopy occurred, and blood loss was minimal. Perioperatively, no adverse neurologic sequelae occurred due to the pneumoperitoneum.

DISCUSSION
==========

Over a 2-year period, an initial laparoscopic approach was performed in 17 patients with a VP shunt malfunction requiring surgical intervention. We were able to safely and effectively perform laparoscopic VP shunt placement in 65% of the cases, offering these patients the advantages of laparoscopy over laparotomy.

In 1 patient, the laparoscopic approach was used for the initial placement of the VP shunt because of the patient\'s obesity. The remaining cases were all reoperative, accounting for the 35% conversion rate from dense adhesions. Because the average patient with hydrocephalus undergoes 2.1 shunt revisions every 3 years, the more minimally invasive approach is preferable.^[@B10]^

An initial laparoscopic approach is advocated when a distal obstruction is due to adhesions or pseudocysts.^[@B3]--[@B7]^ Laparoscopic adhesiolysis or pseudocyst marsupialization can be performed safely in most cases by using electrocautery, sharp dissection, or both. Although an initial laparoscopic approach was attempted in all cases, 6 patients demonstrated dense adhesions not amenable to safe laparoscopic adhesiolysis.

When distal VP shunts disconnect or fracture, their location within the peritoneum can be varied. Laparoscopic retrieval and replacement of the VP shunt can easily be performed.^[@B8],[@B9]^ Placement of the working 5-mm port in either the right or left mid abdominal wall is opposite to the planned side of the new catheter. This allows optimal use of this working port for catheter retrieval, repositioning, or initial positioning.

Moreover, a proximal cause of a nonfunctioning catheter can be evaluated laparoscopically. In 2 cases, we were able to laparoscopically observe proper functioning of the shunt within the peritoneum, requiring no further revision of the intraabdominal portion of the catheter.

During pneumoperitoneum, a theoretical risk exists of pressure transmission into the central nervous system. We do not routinely clamp the VP shunt and rely solely on the 1-way valve. No neurologic sequelae have occurred when this technique has been used. Visualization of CSF dripping out of the functioning shunt confirms that the intracranial pressure exceeds our pneumoperitoneum. A pneumoperitoneum of 10 mm Hg using CO~2~appears to be safe and effective for laparoscopic procedures in these patients with VP shunts.

CONCLUSION
==========

An initial laparoscopic approach for VP shunt malfunctions requiring surgery is advocated. If the adhesions are too dense or laparoscopic adhesiolysis cannot be safely performed, then conversion to a formal laparotomy is warranted.

Figuring out how to pedal a bike and memorizing the rules of chess require two different types of learning, and now for the first time, researchers have been able to distinguish each type of learning by the brain-wave patterns it produces.

These distinct neural signatures could guide scientists as they study the underlying neurobiology of how we both learn motor skills and work through complex cognitive tasks, says Earl K. Miller, the Picower Professor of Neuroscience at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and senior author of a paper describing the findings in the Oct. 11 edition of Neuron.

When neurons fire, they produce electrical signals that combine to form brain waves that oscillate at different frequencies. “Our ultimate goal is to help people with learning and memory deficits,” notes Miller. “We might find a way to stimulate the human brain or optimize training techniques to mitigate those deficits.”

The neural signatures could help identify changes in learning strategies that occur in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, with an eye to diagnosing these diseases earlier or enhancing certain types of learning to help patients cope with the disorder, says Roman F. Loonis, a graduate student in the Miller Lab and first author of the paper. Picower Institute research scientist Scott L. Brincat and former MIT postdoc Evan G. Antzoulatos, now at the University of California at Davis, are co-authors.

Explicit versus implicit learning

Scientists used to think all learning was the same, Miller explains, until they learned about patients such as the famous Henry Molaison or “H.M.,” who developed severe amnesia in 1953 after having part of his brain removed in an operation to control his epileptic seizures. Molaison couldn’t remember eating breakfast a few minutes after the meal, but he was able to learn and retain motor skills that he learned, such as tracing objects like a five-pointed star in a mirror.

“H.M. and other amnesiacs got better at these skills over time, even though they had no memory of doing these things before,” Miller says.

The divide revealed that the brain engages in two types of learning and memory — explicit and implicit.

Explicit learning “is learning that you have conscious awareness of, when you think about what you’re learning and you can articulate what you’ve learned, like memorizing a long passage in a book or learning the steps of a complex game like chess,” Miller explains.

“Implicit learning is the opposite. You might call it motor skill learning or muscle memory, the kind of learning that you don’t have conscious access to, like learning to ride a bike or to juggle,” he adds. “By doing it you get better and better at it, but you can’t really articulate what you’re learning.”

abstract: 'We analyze black hole thermodynamics in a generalized theory of gravity whose Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the metric, the Ricci tensor and a scalar field. We can convert the theory into the Einstein frame via a “Legendre"" transformation or a conformal transformation. We calculate thermodynamical variables both in the original frame and in the Einstein frame, following the Iyer–Wald definition which satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. We show that all thermodynamical variables defined in the original frame are the same as those in the Einstein frame, if the spacetimes in both frames are asymptotically flat, regular and possess event horizons with non-zero temperatures. This result may be useful to study whether the second law is still valid in the generalized theory of gravity.'

ByoLogyc: Where You Become New More than 1000 ticket holders got to know ByoLogyc, when it opened its Versatile Intern Program, and invited members of the public to join up at the launch party, held at a nightclub. Over 12 shows, participants became embroiled in bitter inter-office dramas, competed in some fun activities, sampled ByoLogyc's latest product, and witnessed the creation of the super-virus that would destroy our world. Highlights Participants were split up into departmental groups, each led by a member of ByoLogyc's senior staff, who guided them through a number of activities that illustrated the high and lows of life at ByoLogyc.

Participants were encouraged to take an active role, by asking questions and performing tasks.

Loads of rabbit holes leading to the deeper world of ByoLogyc, including its website, its phone support line, product videos, a documentary comic, and mysterious phone calls received by participants from someone with a grudge against ByoLogyc.

A scripted climax where participants watched staff members respond to an escalating crisis, before being evacuated from the building.

ByoLogyc: Patient Zero Over 2000 visitors moved through ByoLogyc's free Public Health and Community Wellness Clinic, set up for one night in order to respond to growing threat presented by the BRX virus. Scotiabank Nuit Blanche offered the perfect context for ByoLogyc's outreach, as an all-night arts festival with tens of thousands of potential victims roaming the streets. Those who responded to the invitation experienced an intense ten minute journey through a crumbling corporation and a disaster on the horizon. Highlights A century-old church fully transformed into a medical processing facility, complete with quarantined areas, cleaning stations, and an examination area.

All visitors were efficiently introduced to ByoLogyc and the BRX virus by a combination of actors, video stations, detailed signage, and an online dissident faction communicating with visitors via SMS.

A team of medical staff administered a personal examination for every visitor.

An immunization pill was offered to every visitor. Those who elected not to take it were photographed, and the image projected outside for passers-by to be alerted about the possible risk.

There was a great array of activity with white water rafting, some unbelievable hiking (knuckles mountain and Adam's Peak) a fantastic bike ride with informative stops along the way, visiting a tea plantation, lots of history with Sigiriya and Polonnaruva and much more.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?

Watching the sunrise from Adam's peak was phenomenal but so was an impromptu few minutes of cricket with the tea pickers children

What did you think of your group leader?

Ruwan was an unbelievable ambassador for his beautiful country. He was so professional, organised, friendly and must have happily answered thousands of questions. He went above and beyond the call of duty time and time again.

Do you have any advice for potential travellers?

There isn't an enormous amount of downtime on this trip but if you throw yourself in you'll really enjoy it. It's a fantastic mixed activity trip to see a beautiful country.

Overall - a good trip
Great group of people and Ruwan was one of the best leaders I have had - and I have been on alot of adventure trips with various companies - over 25!

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?

Really like the hike up to Sigiriya.
Like the paintings the exercise the stories Ruwan told about the kingdom.
I also really like the last day of cycling - but think it should be at least twice as long

By the time the Civil War rolled around, Union and Confederate sympathies were deeply divided. Even though the city fell to Union troops, culturally, St. Augustine remains a deeply southern town. A number of English residents who lived there for generations were accustomed to the insular privileges of aristocracy. Outsiders included Yankees, blacks, Indians and just about anyone whose family hadn't been born generations ago in cities like St. Augustine, Atlanta, Memphis, Richmond, Savannah or Charleston. A former resident of the oldest city declared, ""The caste system in St. Augustine was more rigid than India's. If you're not an insider, you're locked out. There was no New Guard. The Old Guard reproduced.""

By the turn of the twentieth century, Jim Crow laws also characterized the city. Thus, during the civil rights movement in the 1960s, the established and privileged citizens of St. Augustine believed that society functioned best when everything—and everyone—was in its place. They believed that there were no racial issues in St. Augustine. They saw themselves as rational about change, which they saw no need to accelerate. The problems that ensued resulted not only from the fact that they were wrong—anyone can be wrong—but also because they gave implicit support to aggression, supporting their erroneous beliefs.

Anyone who challenged the status quo was labeled a problem. Organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) were labeled a problem. Martin Luther King Jr., who famously visited the city to rally civil rights supporters in 1964, was labeled a problem. He was arrested and spent the night in the St. Augustine jail along with countless other foot soldiers of the civil rights movement.

But that wasn't the worst of it. When a federal district judge, Bryon Simpson (an old chum of prominent Jacksonville defense lawyer Walter Arnold, who is portrayed in this book), demanded that city leaders abandon an imposed curfew and allow civil rights demonstrations to continue as their First Amendment rights dictated, city leaders howled that federal courts had taken over their jurisdiction. The _St. Augustine Record_ published their comments.

In fact, it is well documented that during the civil rights movement, St. Johns County city leadership—in the form of the religious leaders, the business guild, the mayor, the governor, the sheriff, the chief of police and the commissioners—distinguished themselves by abandoning law and order to notorious white supremacists. At the height of the turmoil, the leader of the local integrationists, a dentist named Robert Hayling, was viciously beaten and almost killed during a Klan meeting in 1963. Dr. Hayling was consequently hospitalized and charged with assault.

Yet even after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, many businesses, educational institutions, religious facilities and municipal organizations in St. Augustine had to be forced to enact equitable access and support the civil rights of their black citizens. And many of these city leaders and decision makers during the racial turmoil of St. Augustine in the 1960s were still around ten years later in one role or another in the aftermath of the Athalia Ponsell Lindsley murder.

262,20,18921,"Some of our greatest archaeological finds have happened by accident, revealing wonders from the past. Such a thing could also happen in the Middle Ages, such as when the perfectly preserved body of a girl was discovered along the Via Appia just outside of Rome. The discovery took place in April of 1485.

The best account of this event comes from a letter written by Bartolomeo Fonzio, who was a Renaissance scholar and professor of literature at the University of Florence. He wrote to a friend in Florence:


To explain the whole matter in order: some workmen were digging out the foundation of tombs in search of marble on the Via Appia six miles out of Rome. They had destroyed an arch faced with brick on all sides some ten feet down when they came across a marble box. Opening it up, they found a corpse lying on its face, covered by a layer of fragrant bark two inches thick; all of the inside of the casket was likewise smeared with the same fragrant mixture like some sort of plaster. When this sweet smelling bark was removed, the girl’s face (to begin at the top) was rather pale and as if she had been buried that very day. Her hair, long and dark and firmly fixed to the scalp, was gathered in a knot and divided into twin tresses in girlish manner, all covered by a hairnet of silk interwoven with gold.

Then there appeared small ears, a short forehead, dark eyebrows, the eyes beneath shapely and bright. The nose was still intact, and so soft that if it was pressed by a finger it would flex and yield. The lips were a pale red, the teeth snow-white and small, the tongue from the roof of the mouth all scarlet. The cheeks, chin, and throat – you’d think they belonged to a living person. The arms hung down from the shoulders entire, and would followed wherever you led them. The hands were stretched out, the fingers rounded and tapering with translucent nails, and so firmly fixed that they could not be torn from the joints. Her breast, stomach and belly were equally broad, and appeared white when the fragrant bark was taken away. The nape of her neck, her back and buttocks retained their position and shape and graceful appearance. The beauty of her hips, thighs, shins, and feet likewise gave the impression of a living person.

“In short,” he added, “this girl who had lived when Rome was in its prime seemed as shapely as she was noble.”


Bartolomeo Fonzio also added his own drawing of the girl to the letter:

Several other writers gave details of this discovery. Daniele da San Sebastiano wrote another letter explaining that the sweet smelling bark that covered the girl was made up of “myrrh, frankincense, aloe, and other priceless drugs”, and added she looked “so lovely, so pleasing, so attractive, that, although the girl had certainly been dead fifteen hundred years, she appeared to have been laid to rest that very day.”

Various reports added that tens of thousands of people came out from Rome to see the body – for a couple of days it was the trending topic in the city. Some even arrived to paint a portrait of her. Two days after the body was found, the Roman authorities ordered it be brought back to the city, “amid vast throngs of people”, where it was again put on display. Another writer noted, “One would think there is some great indulgence and remission of sins to be gained by climbing that hill, so great is the crowd, especially of women, attracted by the sight.”

The name of this girl, however, would"

By ERIC LICHTBLAU and SCOTT SHANE

WASHINGTON – F.B.I. agents complained repeatedly, beginning in 2002, about the harsh interrogation tactics that military and C.I.A. interrogators were using in questioning terrorism suspects, like making them do dog tricks and parade in the nude in front of female soldiers, but their complaints appear to have had little effect, according to an exhaustive report released Tuesday by the Justice Department’s inspector general.The report describes major and repeated clashes between F.B.I. agents and their counterparts over the rough methods being used on detainees in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Afghanistan and Iraq – some of which, according to the inspector general, may have violated the Defense Department’s own policies at the time.

It also provides new insight into the intense debates at senior levels of the Justice Department, the Defense Department and the National Security Council over what should and should not be allowed – a debate in which the Defense Department prevailed.The inspector general found that in a few instances, F.B.I. agents participated in interrogations using pressure tactics that would not have been permitted inside the United States. But the “vast majority” of agents followed the bureau’s legal guidelines and “separated themselves” from harsh treatment.

For instance, F.B.I. agents expressed “strong concerns” about the abusive treatment by the C.I.A. in 2002 of Abu Zubaydah, a senior Al Qaeda figure, leading to tense discussions between senior officials at the two agencies over how such important prisoners should be handled.

Still, the bureau “had not provided sufficient guidance to its agents on how to respond when confronted with military interrogators who used interrogation techniques that were not permitted by the F.B.I.,” and that fueled confusion and dissension, the report said.

“In sum, while our report concluded that the F.B.I. could have provided clearer guidance earlier, and while the F.B.I. and DoJ could have pressed harder for resolution of F.B"

DSC and PXRD patterns suggested that a complex is formed in the 3DGMw (FAD012/γCD). SEM and TEM observations are useful as methods for confirming the drug shape. Then, combined with information such as SEM and XRD, it is possible to consider the characteristics of such a complex.^[@ref33]^ In addition, PXRD patterns indicated that the crystalline state of the complex changes. Thus, SEM was performed in order to observe the shape and surface of crystals. FA012 crystals were smooth needles of about 500 μm in size ([Figure [7](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}a). γCD crystals were angular with a smooth surface, and particles were about 50 μm in size ([Figure [7](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}b). Changes in the surface of particles were not noted in the PM (FAD012/γCD) ([Figure [7](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}c). In the 3DGMw (FAD012/γCD), particles were about 300 μm in size, and angular crystals with a smooth surface were evident ([Figure [7](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}](#fig7){ref-type=""fig""}d). Typically, an inclusion complex with γCD is cubical.^[@ref34]^ The current study similarly found cubical crystals in the 3DGMw (FAD012/γCD), suggesting that FAD012 and γCD may form an inclusion complex in the solid state.

The weapon is the heart piece of many attack focused builds and plays an important role on this one too. However, it is not as huge as some think.To start out with a wander in the endgame you only need a wand with some crit and some flat damage. Then you can craft flat damage or attack speed.When you find a decent wand with 2x flat damage and crit or attack speed the ""trigger socketed spells when you use a skill"" craft can be a very good addition to your build. With 3 damage spells that boost your damage this is much better for single target than an attack speed craft.In the endgame you would want a wand with 3x flat, attack speed, crit and trigger. This however is extremely expensive to achieve.

Sin Nombre (English: ""Nameless"") is a 2009 Mexican-American adventure thriller film written and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, about a Honduran girl trying to immigrate to the United States, and a boy caught up in the violence of gang life. 

Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal were executive producers on the Spanish-language film. Sin Nombre won awards for directing and cinematography at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

Plot
Willy, nicknamed El Casper, is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and lives in Tapachula, a Mexican town near the border with Guatemala. He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another.

Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off.

Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still distraught Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping. Unbeknownst to Casper, Sayra follows him off the train. Meanwhile, her father and uncle decide to continue the journey.

Traveling north on a car transport organized by a friend of Casper, Casper and Sayra barely escape a trap laid for them and enter an immigrant shelter, where Sayra sees a familiar face. She is informed that her father has died and her uncle has been caught. In disbelief, she rushes off to cry at the chapel, where Casper comforts her. They reach a river that constitutes the border to the United States. A coyote agrees to take them across one by one. Casper pays the man with his camera containing the cherished pictures of his murdered girlfriend and insists that Sayra go first. When she is halfway across, the gang appears and begins to chase Casper. Casper flees the pursuing gang but runs into Smiley, who shoots him once, then slowly two more times, the last of which is in the head. This allows time for the others to catch up. They then all proceed to empty their magazines into Casper in an execution-style killing, while Sayra struggles to hold on to the raft and screams in horror.

The closing scenes show Sayra phoning her father's new family from outside an American mall, her uncle setting off on another attempt to cross the border, and Smiley getting his lip tattooed as a sign of his loyalty to the gang.

Lorentz rotations Noether current

I want to derive the conserved charge for Lorentz rotations in the target space of the following action.

$$
the Polyakov action with fixed $h_{\alpha\beta}$.
The transformations I assume would take the form
$$
\delta X^\mu=\alpha^\mu_\nu X^\nu.\tag{2}
$$
I'm not quite sure how to apply $$
\mathcal{J}^\alpha=\delta\phi\frac{\delta\mathscr{S}}{\delta(\partial_\alpha\phi)}.\tag{3}

After searching for the form of the result it looks like it should have an anti-symmetric term and an extra term.
A detailed derivation would be really helpful!

A:

Recall that under the global symmetry transformation $\phi \rightarrow \phi + \delta_{\epsilon} \phi$, the Noether current can be determined via $\mathcal{L} \rightarrow \mathcal{L} + \epsilon \partial_{\alpha} \mathcal{J}^{\alpha}$.
Let me try to make this interesting and pedagogical. Let's consider the case of translations first. That is, the transformation $\delta X^{\mu} = b^{\mu}$ just to show you how it works.

275,18,16764,"Hector Barajas joined the 82nd Airborne in 1995, he served as a paratrooper, jumping out of planes dozens of times and taking on various missions on behalf of his country. But in 2004, after being honorably discharged, the United States put him on a flight that led to his biggest battle: being deported to Mexico, a country he left before his fourth birthday.

Barajas, who had a green card, returned to California after his discharge. A month later he began having trouble with the law. He pled guilty to firing a weapon at a car that his friend believed was following them. No one was wounded and Barajas maintains he didn’t pull the trigger.

Had Barajas been a U.S. citizen, he would have served three years in a state prison and that would have been the end of it. But because he wasn’t, he was deported to Mexico a year later. He was doubly punished, and he’s not the only vet susceptible to that treatment.


About 35,000 non-citizens currently serve in the U.S. military and approximately 5,000 permanent resident aliens enlist each year.

“When you go to combat they don’t separate people as permanent residents, we’re all soldiers,” Barajas told Fusion.


That’s been the case since the Revolutionary War, when non-U.S. citizens were first eligible to enlist in the military. They have fought in the War of 1812, the Civil War, both World Wars and more recently Afghanistan and Iraq.

But when non-citizens come back they’re not treated like their U.S.-born counterparts.


For example, multiple studies have found that soldiers who have seen combat face particular risk with substance abuse issues and are more likely to commit crimes compared to civilians.

When non-U.S. citizens with substance abuse issues have interactions with the criminal justice system and get deported they lose access to such VA benefits. They are essentially left without any resource to address the issues that led to their behavior.


This image was removed due to legal reasons.

Banished Veterans

According to calculations from Banished Veterans, a group Barajas leads, the number of deported veterans is in the tens of thousands and includes veterans from Vietnam, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. Barajas personally knows of 103 deported veterans and believes there could be as many as 30,000.


Louis Alvarez, a retired Marine who successfully fought his own deportation order and today remains in the U.S., believes there are at least 3,000 veterans in immigration detention center or in deportation proceedings at any given time.

""We did some research based on where I was detained in the El Centro Detention Center and how many veterans were detained at other locations and we multiplied that by the number of detention centers,” Alvarez explained. Alvarez is now a paralegal and is also a leader with Banished Veterans.


Alvarez knows his numbers may not be accurate but he has little else to go by.

""We tried to get the exact numbers and filed a Freedom for Information Act requests but every time we do the Department of Homeland security denies the requests citing national security,"" Alvarez told Fusion.


The Department of Homeland security denied Fusion’s requests to confirm the number of deported veterans.

“Current and historical statistics on veteran removals are not readily available,” said Virginia Kice, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesperson.

ICE also told Fusion they do take military service into consideration when considering removals.


“ICE exercises prosecutorial discretion for members of the armed forces who have honorably served our country on a case-by-case basis when appropriate. Former ICE Director Morton's June 2011 memo [PDF] on prosecutorial discretion specifically identifies service in the U.S. military as a positive factor that should be considered when deciding whether or not prosecutorial discretion should be exercised,” Kice said in a statement.

But immigration law experts like Margaret Stock, an attorney and expert in immigration and citizenship law, are wary of the ICE claim.


“A lot of these [veterans] could stop their deportation by applying for citizenship but they don’t know they’re eligible to apply,” Stock said. “The government hasn’t done a good job at informing veterans.”

278,5,19749,"A recent book entitled America’s Four Gods, written by Baylor University professors Paul Froese and Christopher Bader, is an in-depth study of how Americans view God.

With the help of the Gallup organization, thousands of people were interviewed. The findings were remarkable. Roughly 5 percent of respondents identified themselves as atheists, but after analyzing the rest of the results, the professors surmised that America has four main views of God:

The Authoritative God. Some 31 percent of Americans believe God is both engaged in the world and judgmental, meaning He will use any way to get our attention and wake us up.

The Critical God. Some 16 percent of those surveyed said God is judgmental and disengaged from our lives.

The Distant God. Twenty-four percent believe God is nonjudgmental but also disengaged from our lives.

By studying the landscape of belief in America, the authors ascertained that roughly 95 percent of Americans believe in God. But believing in God isn’t the same as knowing Him. I have to wonder how many people surveyed perceive God to be an awesome and holy Savior. I have to wonder how many have ever heard God calling their names. I wonder how many of them felt the touch of His Spirit. God reveals Himself through His Word and His Spirit. He doesn’t reveal Himself to only a special few. He is calling out to all of us, wanting us to awaken Him. And you know what? Our spirits cry out to know Him.

The spirit of a man searches past his intellect and knowledge to discover his Creator. First Corinthians 2:10-13 tells us: “It was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God’s deep secrets. No one can know a person’s thoughts except that person’s own spirit, and no one can know God’s thoughts except God’s own Spirit. And we have received God’s Spirit (not the world’s spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us. When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit’s words to explain spiritual truths” (NLT).

God is not moved by opinions or polls. He speaks through His Word and His servants, and to our spirits through the Holy Spirit. He still speaks through His creation!

It is my goal to give proof of who God really is to humanity. It would blow our minds if we truly understood how incredible our Creator is. The problem is, we have allowed others to define God. It is so easy to believe God is mad at you simply by listening to what others have declared.

a) Field of the Invention
The invention is directed to a method for the acceleration of the adjusting movement in a positioning system in which at least one stepping motor is controlled at a variable control frequency f, the adjusting speed is dependent upon the control frequency f, and a positioning step of the adjusting movement is initiated at every period of the control frequency f, wherein the total number of successive positioning steps corresponds to the length of an adjustment area and a determined position within the adjustment area is assigned to every positioning step.
b) Description of the Related Art
It is known to transform the step angles defined for a stepping motor into increments of a longitudinal movement and, on this basis, to operate positioning systems by means of which displacements of device component groups are carried out with high accuracy along an adjustment area or a path. With a suitable arrangement of the coils and phase control of the stepping motor, a sensitive control can be achieved and, therefore, the rotational movement can be advanced in step angles which are so small that even in optical precision instruments such as zoom devices in microscopes the precise positioning of the zoom groups required for changing the magnification while retaining imaging sharpness is achieved.
In the current state of development, typical step angles are 3.75xc2x0 in permanently excited stepping motors, 1.8xc2x0 in hybrid stepping motors and 1xc2x0 in variable reluctance stepping motors. Generally, spindle systems are used to transform the rotational movement into a longitudinal movement.
A problem which must always be taken into consideration when configuring positioning systems with stepping motors consists in that the available torque decreases as the stepping frequency increases because of the limited current rise rate in the turns of the motor winding. Since part of the torque is used for the acceleration of the external mass, e.g., of a zoom group to be displaced, the control frequency range available for starting and stopping decreases as the moment of inertia increases.
Provided the stepping motor is operated with a control frequency in the start and stop frequency range, it can be stopped at any time without step losses. However, in the acceleration frequency range lying within the upper start limit frequency and operating limit frequency, it is impossible to stop the stepping motor without step loss.
Accordingly, in order to prevent inaccuracies in positioning and to achieve short"

286,3,6675," pressure, i.e., the quotient of tidal volume and respiratory system compliance. During constant flow, this triangular pressure-volume product is maximized at tidal volume, so that this quantity must be divided by a factor of 2 to obtain the average that pertains to the entire inflation. The effects of this energy component are concentrated by the low capacity of the baby lung to accept it \[[@CR6]\]. Yet, although driving power may be central to the mechanical forces that cause lung injury, it does not act alone. Not only is the rate at which stress applied important to the consequences of strain, but also the level of tissue tension that existed prior to its application strongly influences the tissue's proximity to the strain threshold for damage and therefore the impact of a given amount of driving power. The latter is conditioned by the level of end-expiratory pressure from which the inflation begins, i.e., total PEEP \[[@CR7]\].

Even though PEEP is not traditionally considered a primary component of the work of breathing because it does not incorporate flow and tissue movement, it does set the platform of pressure upon which driving pressure operates. To increment pressure by a given amount, a greater force is necessary when starting from a higher level of pressure. Therefore, when starting the breath from an already raised pressure baseline, more inflation energy is required than without PEEP. It stands to reason that when PEEP is applied, the higher pressure required to achieve a given tidal volume may exceed the pressure threshold for inciting damage \[[@CR14], [@CR15]\].

Driving pressure importance and limitations {#Sec4}
===========================================

It follows from this analysis that a given numerical value for driving pressure---even one based on transpulmonary pressure---should not be considered safe or dangerous without specifying other conditions, such as the starting pressure (PEEPtot) and potential for tidal recruitment and atelectrauma \[[@CR16]\]. Whereas PEEP applied to a recruitable lung may reduce the number of vulnerable lung units as the associated higher pressures recruit them, those lung units that remain closed or unstable are put under increased stress and strain \[[@CR17]\]. Low compliance alveolar units experience less distention and potentially damaging strain for a given driving pressure. As PEEP increases, the net benefit or hazard may remain unchanged, rise, or fall.

Driving pressure, the difference between two static airway pressure variables (Pplat and PEEPtot) for the individual tidal cycle, cannot be considered as the final and exclusive key to VILI prediction or moderation. Clearly, it seems to be a better predictor of some key outcomes than either of its defining elements \[[@CR4]\]. But it holds the potential to underestimate the ventilation risk, depending on the number and intensity of stress-focusing points, effects of viscoelastance (as reflected by the difference between the end-inspiratory pressures at zero flow \[P1\] and the plateau \[P2\]), or surreptitious and undetected inspiratory muscle tone. Conversely, driving pressures derived from airway pressure recordings alone may overestimate the risk to a lung surrounded by a stiff chest wall. Use of transpulmonary pressure helps circumvent both the muscle activity/tone and chest wall stiffness contributions to raw airway pressure.

Even when the pressures across the lung are reliably estimated, however, pressures alone cannot accurately gauge the injury risk; the frequency with which high-risk cycles are applied determines the intensity of potentially damaging energy application. This consideration of energy load evolved into the unifying concept of VILI generation by the power transferred from the ventilator to the lungs \[[@CR5], [@CR15]\]. Debate continues as to whether the entirety of the inflation power components---resistive, tidal elastic, and PEEP---or simply the driving power (with flow resistive and PEEP-related energy portions sharply discounted) is principally responsible for VILI causation \[[@CR6], [@CR7]\]. Nonetheless, flow rate and PEEP are theoretically influential for reasons already mentioned, and both have been shown experimentally to be potentially important conditioners of the driving pressure \[[@CR18], [@CR19]\].

Another key addition to our understanding is that the experimental thresholds for lung injury to occur are both relatively high and sharp in the normal lungs of both small \[[@CR20]\]"

If you read my latest post - Happy Deepavali, then you’d know that I posted that in a
completely sleep deprived condition in my attempt to be productive. Who am I
kidding? I’m the best procrastinator I have ever met, so I ended up posting two
pictures from the shoot when in my head I planned for like five. ha-ha. =.=’

(and now I’m thinking nobody wants to read what crap I have
to say)

Seriously.

* * * * * * * * * *

Like I briefly mentioned in my previous post, I was out
shooting with a group of friends at an Indian temple yesterday night. It was my
first time attending and shooting a Deepavali celebration, although the
atmosphere yesterday was not so much of a festive celebration. What went down
yesterday was the lighting of hundreds of candles all over the temple, where
people donated money and in exchange, they were given candles to light and to
place them in the temple. In other words, it is called “Diva Lighting For
Charity”. I am not familiar as to whether any other Indian temple practice
the same tradition, to light candles on the eve of the Deepavali celebration.
Yes, today is the actual day by the way.

For this shoot, I went trigger happy and shot quite a number of
pictures. But as I came back and reviewed the pictures, I realised most of them
were repetitive and for the rest, they were just pictures which doesn’t tell
stories, or I just didn’t like them. In the end, out of all the pictures I took,
there is about give and take ten photos at most. I’m going to stop rambling now,
so enjoy the pictures!

If you noticed I shot a picture of this deity (I'm sorry I didn't get the name) from a different angle in my previous post (Happy Deepavali). Similar to that picture, this was also shot with the 25mm CCTV lens. During my post-processing, I didn't add any vignette to it so this is as it is from the lens. I'm pretty happy with the results from the CCTV lens, I think I'll do a separate post on that lens alone.

This little kid whose name starts with an R, is the most adorable expressive hyperactive kid I have ever met. He is also pretty much photogenic on camera, except that he keeps bouncing up and down so much that it was difficult to get a clear shot of him. I switched to continuous AF to try to get a clear picture of him. That worked, so you'll see more of him later. :)

I never loved black and white so much, until I post processed this into a black and white picture. Strip all the colors, and it's just too gorgeous.

This was photographed in a completely dark hall illuminated by hundreds of candles. It was such a beautiful sight.(The little girl is the younger sister of the girl pictured above by the way).

Daddy's little boy

I did finally get a good clear picture of him and I've never been more amazed with what my camera can do coupled with the 45mm, I do love love this lens so much more with every time I shoot with it.

I think by now, you get what I mean by the pictures were somewhat
repetitive. I decided to make most of my subjects as the children, and the
pictures appear to be overlapping when you see them in a set. But I do love each
of the pictures I posted here, which is why I decided to post them anyway.

I'm betting that many of them, if they're paying attention to what Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) wants to do to the Medicare program, are having some serious buyer's remorse. If Democrats are wise, they're already drafting a strategy to remind Medicare beneficiaries, including card-carrying Tea Party members, just how fooled they were into thinking that Republicans were the protectors of the government-run program they hold so dear.

As a speaker at an especially contentious town hall meeting during the summer of 2009, I saw firsthand just how many senior citizens were snookered about how reform legislation would alter Medicare. Shortly after I testified before Congress about how the insurance industry was conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to influence public opinion about reform, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-New Jersey) invited me to share my perspective as a former insurance industry insider at his September 3, 2009, town hall meeting at Montclair State University.

More than 1,000 people had crammed into the school's auditorium, not so much to hear the speakers as to express their opinions. Reform opponents were on one side of the auditorium, and reform advocates were on the other side. I had to shout just to be heard above the insults the groups were hurling at each other.

290,28,337,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) â?? The Upper Midwest remains locked in the deep freeze, with bitter temperatures stretching into a fourth day across several states.

The cold snap arrived Saturday night as waves of Arctic air swept south from Canada, pushing temperatures to dangerous lows and leaving a section of the country well-versed in winter's pains reeling.

Authorities suspect exposure has played a role in at least four deaths so far.

""I am wearing a Snuggie under a top and another jacket over that,"" said Faye Whitbeck, president of the chamber of commerce in International Falls, Minn., a town near the Canadian border where the temperature was minus 30 on Tuesday morning. The so-called ""Nation's Icebox"" reached a balmy 3 below for a high. ""I pulled out a coat that went right to my ankles this morning and I wore two scarves.""

Among the coldest temperatures recorded Tuesday was 35 below at Crane Lake, Minn., a National Weather Service forecaster said early Wednesday.

The coldest location in the lower 48 states Monday was Embarrass, Minn., at 36 below. On Sunday it was Babbitt, Minn., at 29 below, according to the National Weather Service.

Forecasters said late Tuesday that overnight temperatures wouldn't get that low, but warned it was still frigid: Embarrass, Minn., was up to 15 below by late Tuesday night.

Nighttime temperatures round 10 degrees made it harder for Chicago firefighters to battle a warehouse blaze described by officials as one of the largest in recent years. The Chicago Sun-Times reported late Tuesday that more than 170 firefighters responded to the five-alarm blaze at an abandoned warehouse on the city's South Side that took nearly three hours to get under control.

The Northeast was also feeling the chill from Ohio to Maine.

In Connecticut, overnight temperatures were expected to range from 0 to 10 degrees over the next several days, and the wind chill could make it feel as cold as minus 15 degrees in some parts of the state. In Millinocket, Maine, residents awoke to temperatures of minus 9 degrees

The bitter conditions were expected to persist into the weekend in the Midwest through the eastern half of the U.S., said Shawn DeVinny, a National Weather Service meteorologist in suburban Minneapolis.

Ariana Laffey, a 30-year-old homeless woman, kept warm with a blanket, three pairs of pants and six shirts as she sat on a milk crate begging near Chicago's Willis Tower on Tuesday morning. She said she and her husband spent the night under a bridge, bundled up under a half-dozen blankets.

""We're just trying to make enough to get a warm room to sleep in tonight,"" Laffey said.

But in Sioux Falls, S.D., where winter temperatures are normally well below freezing, some homeless shelters had open beds. Shelter managers suspect people who needed a place to stay were already using the services before the temperatures reached more extreme lows. The first cold snap of the season was in early December. Overnight temperatures dropped to 9 below with the wind chill. In Vermillion, S.D., a water pipe break forced the evacuation of a dormitory at the University of South Dakota, with nearly 500 students offered hotel rooms.

In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, residents woke to a wind chill that made it feel like 35 below. The temperature in Madison, Wis., was a whopping 1 degree above just before midday Tuesday. For northern Illinois, it was the first time in almost two years that temperatures had dipped below zero.

The temperature in Detroit was a toasty 7 degrees with a 10 below wind chill around midday. City officials said they planned to extend hours at its two warming centers. A warming center run by St. Peter and Paul Jesuit Church downtown that usually sees 50 to 60 people on a typical winter day had taken in about 90 people Tuesday morning.

293,1,20875,"Geraldine Jones (character)

Geraldine Jones was a fictional African American character, the most famous recurring persona of comedian Flip Wilson. Geraldine was played as a sassy liberated Southern woman who was coarsely flirty yet faithful to her (unseen) boyfriend ""Killer"". Poorly educated, she was nevertheless confident; she did not change her behavior to suit anyone. Several of Geraldine's sayings entered U.S. popular culture as catchphrases, especially ""When you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not,"" ""The Devil made me do it,"" and ""What you see is what you get!""

Wilson portrayed Geraldine many times in the early 1970s on his variety series The Flip Wilson Show, though not on every episode. He made comedy albums featuring Geraldine, notably The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress, and he appeared as Geraldine on other programs such as Saturday Night Live. He sang and danced as Geraldine at the Kennedy Center in 1983 for Bob Hope's 80th birthday celebration. Wilson tired of the Geraldine character late in his career; he responded to most requests by saying: ""She's retired.""

Origin
Since the mid-1960s, Wilson had been using high-pitched voices to characterize women in his comedy routines. He said he was inspired by Butterfly McQueen's innocent depiction of ""Prissy"", Scarlett O'Hara's maid in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind. He used a high, brassy voice to portray from a black perspective both Queen Isabella (introduced as Queen Isabel Johnson) and a West Indian woman in a comedy routine titled ""Christopher Columbus"", appearing on his 1967 album Cowboys and Colored People. Wilson worked at developing his own version of the voice, imagining a black Southern woman living in a rural area. He performed embryonic Geraldine-type routines at stand-up comedy clubs, but not wearing women's clothing, and not with the name Geraldine.

Wilson said he got the name Geraldine from a friend he had when he was eight or nine, a pretty girl that did not return his adoration. He said he always held a warm regard for her.

The character of Geraldine was intended by Wilson to ""relate to women"" without putting them down. Wilson said he wanted Geraldine to be strong, proud, and honest in her dedication to her man; a woman who felt free to act spontaneously. In contrast to other comedians who belittled women, Wilson wanted Geraldine to be ""the heroine of the story.""

Introduction
Wilson first introduced Geraldine by name and appearance in a comedy sketch on Labor Day, September 1, 1969, within a television special put together by Wilson, his manager Monte Kay, and NBC executives. The show was called The Flip Wilson Special. In the skit, comedian Jonathan Winters, dressed in drag as his popular character Maude Frickert—a gray-haired lady with a sharp tongue, was a passenger in an airliner. Wilson's Geraldine character entered, walking down the jet's aisle in a stewardess's miniskirt, and a bouffant flip hairdo topped by a pillbox hat. Geraldine sat down next to Maude and the comedic interaction was immediately infectious. Wilson said that Winters was chosen because his Maude character was well-known, and because there would be several points of comic tension: both men playing women, the generational difference in apparent age, and the difference in race.

Wilson also performed as Geraldine on The Ed Sullivan Show on January 11, 1970. In the routine, Wilson takes on the persona of a preacher's wife. The wife (Geraldine) explains to her angry husband why she has an expensive new dress, telling him that ""the devil made me buy this dress."" This skit was also performed by Wilson on his fourth comedy album, The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress—its title taken from Geraldine's retort. The album, featuring Geraldine on the cover, was certified Gold, and it won the 1970 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording.

Production
The Flip Wilson Special was seen by 42% of all U.S. television viewers; this success led to NBC signing Wilson to The Flip Wilson Show. Wilson portrayed Geraldine many times during the four-year run of the show. Geraldine was cast in skits with a number of guests on the show, including David Frost, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin (playing Ernestine), Joe Namath, Jim Brown, Arte Johnson, Moms Mabley, Sammy Davis Jr.,"

Proving a Line to bisect a line in a Triangle

From point $A$ tangents $AB$ and $AC$ to a circle are drawn ($B$ and $C$ tangent points); $PQ$ is a diameter of the circle; line $L$ is tangent to the circle at point $Q$. Lines $PA$, $PB$, and $PC$ intersect line $L$ at points $A_1, B_1, C_1$. Prove that $A_1B_1 = A_1C_1$. 

A:

My idea is to show that by taking $M$ as the midpoint of $B_1C_1$, we prove that $BA, AC$ and $PM$ meet at the same point $A$ and hence $M=A_1$. To do this, we can look at the triangle $BP_1C_1$. (For this paragraph, refer to the original image of the problem statement, thanks.)

We do a change of variables to make it clearer, and draw a image to make it more understandable. (Note: the circle in the problem is the circumcircle of $\triangle BDF$, while the $FG$ line in my graph refers to the tangent line $BA$ in the problem.)
Let us discuss an acute triangle $\triangle ABC$ with $BD\perp AC$ at $D$, $DF\perp AB$ at F, $E,M$ being the midpoints of $BD$ and $AC$ respectively, and $FG_A\perp EF$ such that $FG_A$ intersects $BM$ at $G_A$. We do the same operation on the other side of $BD$ to get $G_C$. Our goal is to prove $BG_A=BG_C$ and conclude that $GB$ bisects $AC$. 
By the Sine Law,  $$BG_A = \sin \angle BFG_A\cdot \frac{BF}{\sin\angle FG_AB}=\sin A\cdot\frac{BF}{\sin(A-\angle ABM)} = BD\cdot\frac{\sin^2 A}{\sin (A-\angle ABM)}$$
and similarly we can get $$BG_C = BD\cdot\frac{\sin^2 C}{\sin (C-\angle CBM)}$$
Hence, our goal is to prove $BG_A=BG_C$ which will give us $G_A=G_C$: $$\frac{\sin^2 A}{\sin (A-\angle ABM"

FIRST PRINTING ANNOUNCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSISTOR, A DISCOVERY THAT INITIATED THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGE. ""In 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, working at Bell Telephone Laboratories, were trying to understand the nature of the electrons at the interface between a metal and a semiconductor. They realized that by making two point contacts very close to one another, they could make a three terminal device - the first ""point contact"" transistor. They quickly made a few of these transistors and connected them with some other components to make an audio amplifier. This audio amplifier was shown to chief executives at Bell Telephone Company, who were very impressed that it didn't need time to ""warm up"" (like the heaters in vacuum tube circuits). They immediately realized the power of this new technology. This invention was the spark that ignited a huge research effort in solid state electronics. Bardeen and Brattain received the Nobel Prize in Physics, 1956, together with William Shockley, ""for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect."" â&#128;"" Nobel Prize Committee. In ""The Transistor"" (1948) is the schematic diagram, showing the construction of the germanium triode, or transistor, a semi-conducting device which could act as an oscillator or an amplifier, thereby replacing larger, bulky, less efficient vacuum tubes. The longer 1949 paper includes this same diagram, but also contains a cutaway microphotograph of the transistor. Research by Bardeen and Brattain led them to the discovery that electron flows on the surface of a semi-conducting surface (initially silicon and germanium) may be modulated and controlled by ""doping"" the crystal with specific quantities and depositions of conducting elements. Hence was born the technology of microelectronics, by employing layers of ""dirty sand"" to build the complex electronic circuitry that we use every day today. ""The transistor revolutionized the electronics industry, allowing the Information Age to occur, and made possible the development of almost every modern electronic device, from telephones to computers to missiles. [Bardeen's] developments in superconductivity, which won him his second Nobel, are used in medical advances such as CAT scans and MRI."" â&#128;"" Wikip. Bardeen is the only person to have won the Nobel Prize in physics twice. The first time was for the invention of the transistor, awarded in 1956. The second time was in 1972, with Leon N. Cooper and John Robert Schrieffer, for a fundamental theory of conventional superconductivity known as the ""BCS theory."" With: Richard P. Feynman,"

WARWICK SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
Supreme Court of Rhode Island.
August 9, 1950.
Coffey, Ward, Hoban & Reed, Providence, for appellants.
FLYNN, Chief Justice.
This appeal from the ""decisions and doings"" of the school committee of the city of Warwick was filed with the director of education for the state of Rhode Island by certain teachers of that city in accordance with general laws 1938, chapter 199, as amended. Statements of fact and briefs were presented by the respective parties and after consideration of the arguments and law the director denied and dismissed the appeal. Thereupon at the request of appellants the director's findings and decision were referred to a justice of the supreme court for a final decision in accordance with the provisions of the above-mentioned statute.
It appears from the record that the appellants are teachers in the public high schools of the city of Warwick; that they *314 have been teaching in that city under three or more successive annual contracts like the one in question, thereby attaining the status of teachers ""in continuing service"" under public laws 1946, chap. 1775, sec. 3; and that each of them has again signed a similar contract in the form submitted by the respondent school committee which governs their services for the year 1949 to 1950.
That form of appointment, received by each appellant on or before April 20, 1949, reads as follows:
""At a meeting of the Warwick School Committee held on April 12th, you were elected to teach in the public schools of Warwick for the school year beginning September 7, 1949, at a salary at the rate of $ __________ annually, to be paid in installments as provided in the rules and regulations of the School Committee.
""Your engagement as a teacher in Warwick is based upon your acceptance of the following named conditions:
""1. You shall be subject to assignment and transfer by the School Committee or its executive officer.
""2. You shall perform all work in a satisfactory manner, including such extra-curricular activities as may be assigned.
""3. If the Professional Improvement Requirements of the by-laws, Article III, Section 11, are not met by September 1949, your salary for the next school year will continue as at present.
""4. You shall return the acceptance of your appointment to the Clerk of the School Committee within ten days of the date of its issuance, as otherwise it will be regarded as a resignation.

It’s imperative for Canada to ratify the new North American free-trade deal, says a leading business group, as the federal government released its long-awaited economic assessment of the pact Wednesday.

Goldy Hyder, the president of the Business Council of Canada, said the uncertainty created by rail blockades and the spread of the novel coronavirus could cause serious harm to the Canadian economy.

“Given the backdrop in which this discussion is happening – we’ve had the CN Rail strike, we’ve had the blockades, we’ve had the virus, we’ve had the China-U.S. deal, we have our own foray with China we’re involved in — all of these things are elements of a perfect storm that are really impacting economic growth,” Hyder said in an interview.

The government’s assessment predicts a very modest gain in the Canadian economy, estimating the deal will be worth an additional $6.8 billion by 2025 — which amounts to a 0.25 per cent gain in gross domestic product — compared with having no continental trade agreement at all. It does not compare the new deal to the old NAFTA.

The assessment the Liberals released comes after demands by opposition parties to explain the economic benefits of the new deal, which is still awaiting final ratification by Parliament.

Hyder said it’s time to set domestic politics aside and get on with ratifying the deal.

A leading trade specialist says all the fuss about the economic benefits of the deal misses an important political point.

“What econometric assessments don’t show is the significant geopolitical value to Canada of a solid rules-based framework for dealing with the U.S. in the years ahead,” said Lawrence Herman, a Toronto-based international trade lawyer.

Negotiations over continental trade were forced on Canada and Mexico by U.S. President Donald Trump, who mused about scrapping the old North American Free Trade Agreement if it weren’t renegotiated in America’s favour.

Throughout the negotiation, the Liberal government was seized with not only protecting Canada’s market access to the United States but protecting the survival of the global rules-based trading order that has come under threat from Trump’s protectionism.

“There’s much more to this agreement than pure economic models suggest. Black box assessments might turn up numbers that don’t seem stratospheric and headline grabbing but there are important political and strategic gains for Canada in this deal. These can’t be measured in purely economic terms,” said Herman.

OPINION
HOLLENHORST, Acting P.J.
Defendant appeals from the judgment entered by the trial court upon his conviction by plea on one count of involuntary manslaughter. (Pen. Code, § 192, subd. (b).)[1]


*1615 FACTS
Late one evening, a Jorge Barrasa heard a woman yelling from a nearby wooded area. Barrasa did not understand English, but he could tell that the woman was calling for help. Barrasa drove to the wooded area and, upon arriving, observed a car speeding away from the scene of the disturbance. Barrasa drove into a tree lane where he saw a young woman walking toward him. The young woman then dropped to her knees.
Barrasa could see that the woman's face had been bloodied. He left to enlist the assistance of his friend, Hector Gomez. The two men summoned law enforcement personnel and paramedics and then returned to the wooded area. Upon reaching the woods, the woman began running toward the two men. The woman told Barrasa and Gomez that ""someone had tried to kill her, someone tried to run over her...."" Paramedics arrived shortly thereafter.
Early the following morning, the woman died. She had suffered multiple head wounds, serious hematomas and severe liver lacerations. It was theorized that something heavy, such as an automobile, had fallen on her.
Witnesses revealed to law enforcement investigators that the woman had last been seen in the company of defendant. The investigators interviewed defendant's girlfriend, who told the investigators that defendant had returned home late on the night in question with a bite mark on his thumb and scratches on his face. The girlfriend stated that defendant had explained his minor injuries by telling her that he had been in a fight with another man and that he might have run over that other man with his car as he was trying to leave the scene of the fight.
The investigators then interviewed defendant. At first, defendant denied having been with the woman and repeated his earlier statements that he had been injured in a fight with another man. Later, however, defendant finally admitted that he had accidentally run over the woman. He explained that he had had a fight with the woman and that the two of them had fallen from his car; he got back in his car and found that it was stuck in the dirt; he managed to free his car and drove away, unaware that he had run over the woman.
An information was filed against defendant, charging him with one count of murder (§ 187, subd. (a)) and one count of hit and run with injury (Veh. Code, § 20001). Defendant was arraigned on the information and pled not guilty to both charges. On the date set for his pretrial hearing, defendant withdrew his not guilty plea and entered a plea of guilty to a single charge *1616 of involuntary manslaughter (§ 192, subd. (b)) set forth in an amended information as a lesser related offense of the original murder charge. The amended information and related guilty plea were the product of a negotiated plea bargain in which the district attorney had agreed to reduce the murder charge to involuntary manslaughter and dismiss the hit-and-run charge, with no agreement as to sentence, in exchange for a guilty plea.
At the sentencing hearing, the trial court denied probation and sentenced defendant to a middle prison term of three years. In denying probation, the trial court stated: ""The Court is"

Fuller & Williams, Twin Falls, for cross-respondent. Timothy J. Williams argued.
*335 TROUT, Justice.
This is a drug trafficking and manufacturing case. The defendant, Gary Griffith (Griffith), initially sought review of two adverse evidentiary rulings. The State then cross-appealed the district court's grant of Griffith's motion to dismiss the jury verdicts which found Griffith guilty of manufacturing a controlled substance and manufacturing a controlled substance in the presence of children. Prior to oral argument, Griffith withdrew his appeal and argument was heard solely on the State's cross-appeal.

I.

FACTUAL SUMMARY
The Twin Falls police were called to the Griffith home after Griffith's wife, Bonnie, reported she had been battered by Griffith. The police arrested Griffith, whereupon he became angry and insisted that the police accompany him into the house. Griffith then showed them marijuana plants which were growing in the kitchen. He claimed these plants were grown by Bonnie while he was away in California. He also showed the officers marijuana seeds hidden in a waterbed. The police charged Griffith with manufacturing a controlled substance, manufacturing a controlled substance while children were *336 present, trafficking in marijuana, failure to affix a tax stamp, and battery.
The case went to trial, and the jury found Griffith guilty of all charges except battery. After trial Griffith brought a motion for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to I.C.R. 29(c). The trial court concluded that there was no evidence to support the charges of manufacturing a controlled substance or manufacturing a controlled substance in the presence of a child and, therefore, entered a judgment of acquittal on those two counts.
Originally, this case was appealed by Griffith, who contended that the trial court committed error in allowing the police officers to testify and identify the plants and seeds as marijuana, and also that the trial court erred in permitting testimony about the total number of marijuana plants. Prior to oral argument, Griffith withdrew his appeal and the sole issue now under review is the State's cross-appeal from the grant of the motion for judgment of acquittal.

II.

ANALYSIS

A. Interpretation of the manufacturing statutes

A determination of whether the trial court correctly granted the motion to dismiss the jury verdicts requires us first to interpret the manufacturing statutes at I.C. §§ 37-2732, -2737A. When we review the trial court's interpretation of a statute, we exercise free review. O'Loughlin v. Circle A Const., 112 Idaho 1048, 1051, 739 P.2d 347, 350 (1987).

Introduction
For the Final Project in ECE 476: Designing with Microcontrollers, Robbins and Saha developed a Speech Recognition Jukebox, comprised of a speech recognition system that activated a simple music player. The speech recognition system was capable of recognizing fourcommands and could cycle through a simple play list of three songs. The jukebox could turn itself on, begin play, move between tracks, and stop play all through user voice commands.
In order to implement this design, Robbins and Saha needed to combine several different hardware and software elements. A small microphone was purchased and used to convert the human voice signal into a voltage signal. This alternating voltage signal was amplified by 1,000 times using three LM358 operational amplifiers. Hardware frequency filters were used to limit the frequency input and software frequency filters were used to parse the signal into different frequency regions.
The values of the signal in these different frequency regions helped to determine each individual words unique digital fingerprint. The fingerprints of important words, such as commands for the music-playing element of the design, were stored into the program. Each time a word was spoken, the fingerprint of this sample word was compared to the stored fingerprints to determine which command, if any, was spoken.
Recognized commands for the system are:

ON

Turn the music player on, play current song

END

Pause the music player

SOON

Play the next song

PREV

Play the previous song

Table 1: Voice Commands Recognized by the System
Given the correct combination of commands, a simple music tune would be played on the speaker of the television. A more in-depth analysis of the workings of both the software and hardware sections of the design can be found below.High Level Software Design
Speech recognition systems have been implemented in a variety of different applications, most notably automated caller systems and security systems. These systems have progressed considerably in recent years and have the capability of performing numerous tasks from simple user vocal commands. For the ECE 476: Designing with Microcontrollers Final Project, Robbins and Sahas ambition was to combine speech recognition technology with music playback. Robbins and Saha were inspired by the work of previous years groups, whose work is cited in Appendix 5, which demonstrated that such a project was realizable within the timing and hardware constraints of the ECE 476 Final Project parameters.Capturing the Human Voice
The human hearing system is capable of capturing noise over a very wide frequency spectrum, from 20 Hz on the low frequency end to upwards of 20,000 Hz on the high frequency end. The human voice, however, does not have this kind of range. Typical frequencies for the human voice are on the order of 100 Hz to 2,000 Hz. Robbins and Saha would have hardware electrical filters that would pass only the frequencies between approximately 150 Hz and 1,500 Hz and several digital Butterworth filters that would work to parse this frequency spectrum into smaller regions. Both of these types of filters are discussed in more depth below.
But how often should one sample a signal that is oscillating at these frequencies? According to Nyquist Theory, the sampling rate should be twice as fast as the highest frequency of the signal, to ensure that there are at least 2 samples taken per signal period. Thus, the sampling rate of the program would have to be no less than 4,000 samples per second.
Also, the human voice moves a sound wave, which compresses and decompresses the air as it moves. As will be discussed below in the Hardware Design section, a microphone was utilized to convert this compression wave into an electrical signal that could be filtered, amplified, and analyzed.Butterworth Digital Filters
The frequency spectrum of the human voice needed to be divided into several sub-intervals to allow analysis of the specific frequency spectrum of the word being spoken. Robbins and Saha divided the frequency spectrum into seven (7) intervals using six 4-pole Butterworth band-pass filters and one 2-pole Butterworth high-pass filter. The table below illustrates the scope of each filter:

Table 2: Frequency Range of Digital Filters
The Butterworth filter attempts to be linear and pass the input as close to unity as possible in the pass band. In the program design, the Butterworth filters manipulated the A/D converter output into the frequency domain. The code for both the high-pass Butterworth filter and the band-pass Butterworth filter were written by Bruce Land and can be found on the ECE 476 course website.Control Section
The output of the digital filters would help to formulate a digital fingerprint that was unique for each word. Five samples were taken from each digital filter, thus yielding 35 total samples that would comprise the digital fingerprint of"
311,9,3659,"After a breathless few weeks during which the entire sporting world has been talking about Chinese football (with yours truly quoted by AFPthreetimes, FTtwice, El Pais, Hicimos, Vice Sports and interviewed by CCTV, BBC and Al Jazeera among others), let’s take a look at a few stories that could be cropping up over the next 12 months…

The World Athletics Championships kick off in Beijing today, with the world’s media focusing more on the doping allegations that have engulfed the sport than on the sporting action. This is completely understandable, given the revelations that have come out in recent weeks – for example, that one third of the athletes who competed at the 2011 World Champs in South Korea had suspicious tests during the previous 12 months.

However, Chinese media – led by national broadcaster CCTV – have been putting more of a positive spin on things, as is their government-directed wont. Wall-to-wall coverage of former meets (including the 2008 Beijing Olympics) has been shown on sports channel CCTV-5 in recent days, educating and encouraging the public in equal measures, in the hope that they embrace these championships.

Jamaica has long been the sprint capital of the world, but as this Sports Illustrated article demonstrates (H/T Ollie Williams), the country’s anti-doping efforts in recent years have been pathetic. In the five months before last year’s Olympic Games in London, guess how many out-of-competition tests were conducted?

One. That’s it. A single measly test. Usain Bolt may be largely superhuman, but given the reputation of both his sport and his country, there will always be questions asked about his performance. As this week’s Sports Talk column discusses, Bolt has the ability to continue the sport’s growth almost singlehandedly, but if he ever falls foul of those testers, track and field could have a quick and very painful death.

Picture credit: AFP

An incredible thing happened about a week ago, when Usain Bolt regained his 100 meters World Championship title. ­Olivier Morin, a ­photographer for AFP, captured a shot of the man nicknamed the ­Lightning Bolt with an actual ­lightning bolt clearly visible in the ­background above the stadium roof.

It was, in some ways, the defining picture of Bolt’s ­remarkable career, one in which he has now won eight World Championship gold medals, six Olympic titles, and set eight world records.

Bolt is undoubtedly the greatest track athlete of his generation. Other athletes have scaled great heights in ­Moscow, but none captivates the ­worldwide press as much as the fastest man in the world, which is why he is scrutinized more than any other athlete.

When it was revealed last month that Tyson Gay and ­Asafa Powell – together ­responsible for half of all the 100 meters times ever run ­under 9.8 seconds – both used performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs, it was impossible not to wonder if Bolt had done as well.

With baseball’s PED ­scandal blown wide"

314,21,3874,"Forty years ago this week, voters passed Proposition 13, the most consequential act of direct democracy in California history. This taxpayer revolt of June 6, 1978 amended the state Constitution, carrying 65% of the vote and all but three counties. Its backers can boast one enduring success: Proposition 13 has, as promised, protected homeowners from sharp increases in their property tax bills.

As for its other goals … well, turning 40 is a good time to take stock.

Proposition 13 was a multipronged attack designed by businessman-activist Howard Jarvis and his supporters to do two things: ease the overall tax burden and protect a stable culture of homeownership. To that end, it set tax rates at 1% of a property’s sale price and capped annual increases at no more than 2%. Then it required future tax hikes of any form to pass the state Legislature by a two-thirds vote. “The most important thing in this country is not the school system, nor the police department nor the fire department,” Jarvis declared after his ballot box victory. “The right to have property in this country, the right to have a home in this country, that’s important.”

Still, it’s hard for California to claim any sort of lasting victory on taxes or homeownership. Today, Californians remain among the most highly taxed people in the nation; low property taxes have been more than offset by increased income, sales and gas taxes. That might not be so bad if Proposition 13 was thereby rendered a wash. But it’s not. Its effects are deeply regressive taxation and distorted local economies and housing markets.


Perhaps most perversely, Proposition 13 has made it harder, not easier, to become a homeowner. California has one of the lowest rates of homeownership (55%) in the nation, second only to New York and nine percentage points below the national average.

Today, Californians remain among the most highly taxed people in the nation; low property taxes have been more than offset by increased income and sales taxes.

The pernicious incentives that led to these outcomes are obvious in hindsight. With property taxes near frozen, local governments began to see residential development as a liability and commercial development as an income stream. For 40 years, that perspective shaped which new projects cities approved. Homeowners, meanwhile, had a disincentive to move if they had a low property tax bill locked in. Finally, these relatively low property taxes made California an attractive place to undertake speculative real estate investments and leave valuable parcels of land undeveloped.

The consequences of Proposition 13 have hit every generation following the baby boomers particularly hard. California is left with a housing shortage and not enough turnover in the real estate market."

                                       OPINION



ROTH, Circuit Judge:

       This is an appeal from the District Court’s dismissal of a § 1983 suit brought by

Richard Prevost, a former police officer in the Township of Hazlet. Prevost’s suit alleges

that defendants Township of Hazlet and several of its employees, under color of state law,

manipulated civil service procedures to deprive him of his job without due process. In

addition to filing this suit, Prevost pursued the administrative procedures available to him

under New Jersey law to contest the disciplinary charges imposed by the Township at the

time of his termination. The District Court dismissed the case on the grounds that

abstention was appropriate under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), in light of these

state administrative proceedings. For the reasons discussed below, we will reverse the


                                             2
District Court’s decision and remand the case.

I.     Jurisdiction and Standard of Review

       The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have appellate

jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

       We exercise plenary review over the legal determination of whether the

requirements for Younger abstention have been met and, if so, we review the District

Court's decision to abstain for abuse of discretion. O'Neill v. City of Phila., 32 F.3d 785,

790 (3d Cir. 1994).

II.    Abstention

       Although the general rule is that the pendency of a state court proceeding is not a

reason for a federal court to decline to exercise jurisdiction established by Congress,

McClellan v. Carland, 217 U.S. 268, 281-82 (1910), an exception to that rule is Younger

abstention. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), established a principle of abstention

when federal adjudication would disrupt an ongoing state criminal proceeding. This

principle has been extended to civil proceedings and state administrative proceedings.

317,16,29557,"Recently Jason Collins became the first current athlete in major professional sports in the US to come out as gay. This earned him the cover of Sports Illustrated and more attention than he ever received for actually playing basketball. Reaction of other athletes and the general public to the announcement seems to be extremely supportive.

A less covered aspect of this story is that Jason has an identical twin brother, Jarron, who is also an NBA veteran and who spent many years underperforming for my Utah Jazz. Jarron is straight and claims to have had no idea whatsoever that his twin brother is gay until very recently. Jarron and Jason have never publicly confirmed or disproven that they are monozygotic (identical) twins. My understanding of twins is that, especially as they grow older, identical twins prefer to emphasize their individuality rather than their genetic commonality, causing them to reject the “identical” moniker. For a variety of reasons, identical twins have slight variations in appearance that usually allow them to be differentiated by people who are paying attention, even though they have the same genes. But most people who have watched the Collins over the years would find it shocking if they were not monozygotic (more shocking than one of them being gay, actually).

There is a long history of studying variation in genetic phenotypes with twin studies. Homosexuality has always proven a genetic puzzle because it lowers reproductive fitness and, therefore, should die out over time. A recent study in the Quarterly Review of Biology (University of Chicago Press) says, “Pedigree and twin studies indicate that homosexuality has substantial heritability in both sexes, yet concordance between identical twins is low and molecular studies have failed to find associated DNA markers.” Thus, if the “born this way” mantra is true, it is clearly more complicated than a simple genetic story.

This same study offers a different account of the biological origins of homosexuality. The authors propose an epigenetic model of sexual orientation. Epigenetic studies (which try to understand how genes are expressed) are all the rage now (just last week I was at an NBER conference where there was an interesting paper on epigenetics and cognitive development in rhesus monkies), and many biosocial phenomena are thought to result from the combination of genes and the environment, where the prenatal environment of the developing fetus is particularly important. It seems that epi-markers are often heritable, which would account for observed heritability in the absence of DNA markers.

I have read a variety of twin research over my career, since twin studies are quite common in economics. Dabbling into this genetic research on homosexuality, I am struck by how little there has been in the past couple of decades, especially given the importance of gay rights as a social concern. But perhaps the politics explains the lack of science. It would be disconcerting, at least, to embark on a field of study where an increasingly large group of politically motivated, influential and often angry people are already convinced they know the answer: sexual orientation is innate and immutable. The activist community wants acceptance, not understanding. Hence, most people will avoid doing science that will cause people to hate them if they get unpopular answers (or, even worse, label them as hateful for even asking the questions).

Both the innate and immutable claims might prove to be true"

The expansive concept of “the figure” reaches into almost every area of contemporary life. With more data than ever at their fingertips, scientists are using figures to make better decisions by the numbers. In the visual arts, the figure defines or puts into perspective the space around it. And of course the figure refers to the physical body and raises questions about how we understand ourselves as both individuals and integral parts of community.

Asymptotic behavior of autoresonant germ
========================================

When $\beta=0$ there exist pure algebraic solutions of (\[pr\]) as $\tau \gg 1$. They were studied in [@KG]. Similar solutions of second order dissipativeless equations are called slowly varying equilibriums [@Haberman].

Let us construct a solution of (\[pr\]) with a slowly varying leading-order term as $\beta>0$. After the following substitution $$\theta=\tau\beta^2,\quad \beta\Psi=\varphi$$ we obtain $$i\beta^4\varphi'+(\theta-|\varphi|^2)\varphi+i\beta^3\varphi=\beta^3 f.
\label{perturbedPR}$$

We construct the solution of the form $$\varphi(\theta,\beta)=\bigg(\sqrt{\theta} +\beta^3
\rho_1(\theta)+\beta^4R(\zeta,\theta,\beta)\bigg)\exp\left\{i(\alpha_0(\theta)+\beta\alpha_1(\theta)+\beta^2A(\zeta,\theta,\beta))\right\},
\label{sol1}$$ where $0<\beta\ll 1$ and $\zeta=\beta^{-3}\theta$ is a fast variable.

Substitute (\[sol1\]) into (\[perturbedPR\]) and gather terms with the same order of $\beta$. It allows us to determine functions $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$ and $\rho_1$ $$\begin{aligned}
\sin(\alpha_0)&=&-\frac{\sqrt{\theta}}{f}, \\
\alpha_1&=&\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\theta(f^2-\theta)}}, \\
\rho_1&=&\frac{\sqrt{f^2-\theta}}{2\theta}.\end{aligned}$$ The residual terms $R$ and $A$ are solutions of the system $$\begin{aligned}

OS X PostgreSQL client with a GUI?

I've recently found a need to work with a PostgreSQL database. As I'm completely new to PostreSQL, I'd like to have a nice GUI for it, much like one for MySQL. 
It must:

Support tunneling over SSH
Support listing databases
Support running queries

Is there an app that does this?

A:

pgAdmin III, the ""official"" GUI client for PostgreSQL is available for OSX, too.
At least the Windows version supports SSH tunneling so I'm pretty sure the OSX version does so, too. Listing databases and running queries are standard features for any database frontend so those features are supported, too.

A:

At work I am using DB Visualizer. This is a database manipulation tool that supports a large number of database systems, including PostgreSQL. It is written in Java, which means it is cross-platform compatible. I have experience with the free Linux version of it, but the website states it supports the 3 major OS-es.
Here is how it fits your requirements:

Support tunneling over SSH

According to the features list, it does support SSH tunneling for known_hosts and has private key support (see Connection Management section)

Support listing databases

It does support listing and browsing databases and database infrastructure.

Support running queries

It has Query window that allows executing queries and examining the results
Still there are some drawbacks to it, I'll list the few I am considering important and the ones I have personally rated as downsides:

It is commercial, although free version with limited functionality is available. That free version seems to support all items of your list though.
Built-in support only for some of the database engines. You may require to manually import database JDBC drivers for commercial servers, it is possible with the GUI though. PostgreSQL is supported by default, so this will not bother you.
It runs on Java, so you need to have a Java runtime pre-installed, or download the heavier executable which has an embedded JRE. Having Java involved could reflect on the memory consumption of your machine, thus affecting the computer performance.
Using the free version, I find it too basic and feature-stripped (by the time writing of this post), compared to pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench and quite far behind Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - the other database tools I have experience working with. In other words - do not expect too much from it. Your list of requirements is basic enough as well, so I assume you can do without luxuries. Remember, though, I use the free version on Linux, so your experience with it on a Mac will hardly be any worse, and I am not complaining at all.
The syntax highlighting may not support all the language features. I had the ""pleasure"" of working a lot with IBM Informix using this software and the syntax highlighting of keywords and even specific dialect constructs was missing or incorrect, but bear in mind that Informix is not well supported in general. I cannot recall similar issues with PostgreSQL, but it does not mean there could not be any.
The free version limits the number of open query windows to ONE! This seemed a serious drawback at first, but it fairly compensates with back and forward navigation, that allow you to change the query to any recently open file. Also, DbVisualizer can launch multiple instances, which with a different query in each window.
The free version goes real bad here. It allows you to execute only one single statement per query!!! This can become problem for complex scripts with strict sequential logic and specific syntax. For instance, was unable to successfully call MySQL stored procedure definition script due to statement delimiters messing up.

If you are looking for a free tool that can work with a variety of database engines, possibility for custom support of unknown or commercial vendors (by manually providing the drivers in their JDBC-standard implementation), simple user interface and a reason to install JRE on your machine, then behold the almighty DB Visualizer!
Besides being a little mocky at times in my description, I find this software valuable and suitable for nearly all of my needs. Now, let me list some of the advantages I really appreciate:

The free version is enough for database access, browsing and querying. 
Being Java based, it requires JDBC drivers to work with different database engines. Since JDBC"

title: On the Exponent of a Verbal Subgroup in a Finite Group
---

Introduction
============

A number of outstanding results about words in finite groups have been obtained in recent years. In this context we mention Shalev’s theorem that for any non-trivial group word $w$, every element of every sufficiently large finite simple group is a product of at most three $w$-values [@shal], and the proof by Liebeck, O’Brien, Shalev and Tiep [@lost] of Ore’s conjecture: Every element of a finite simple group is a commutator. Another significant result is that of Nikolov and Segal that if $G$ is an $m$-generated finite group, then every element of $G'$ is a product of $m$-boundedly many commutators [@nisegal].

Our interest in words began in [@ams99] where it was shown that if $G$ is a residually finite group in which all commutators have orders dividing a given prime-power, then the derived group $G'$ is locally finite. Later, in [@lola; @vari; @comu68; @deltacom] we treated other problems on local finiteness of verbal subgroups in residually finite groups. Inevitably, at a crucial point we had to deal with questions about the exponent of a verbal subgroup of a finite group.

Recall that a group has exponent $e$ if $x^e=1$ for all $x\in G$ and $e$ is the least positive integer with that property. Given a word $w$, we denote by $w(G)$ the verbal subgroup of $G$ generated by the values of $w$. The goal of the present paper is to prove the following theorem.

[Theorem A.]{} [*Let $w$ be a multilinear commutator and $G$ a finite group in which any nilpotent subgroup generated by $w$-values has exponent dividing $e$. Then the exponent of the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is bounded in terms of $e$ and $w$ only.*]{}

This result provides a potentially useful tool for reduction of questions on finite groups to those on nilpotent groups. Historically, tools of this nature played important role in solutions of various problems in group theory, most notably the restricted Burnside problem [@hahi].

Multilinear commutators (outer commutator words) are words which are obtained by nesting commutators, but using always different indeterminates. Thus the word $[[x_1,x_2],[x_3,x_4,x_5],x_6]$ is a multilinear commutator while the Engel word $[x_1,x_2,x_2,x_2]$ is not. An important family of multilinear"

Installing a shiftable or rotatable feedthrough is very unpractical, particularly in the ultra-high vacuum system used for Fourier transform mass spectrometry (operating in the range of 10xe2x88x9210 mbar). Furthermore, these devices are hardly suitable for carrying out experiments on a particular stored ensemble of ions. Aside from this, the methods used for switching over are time consuming and do not offer any possibility (particularly during routine operation) of performing electron and photon interaction studies using the same stored ions in the same sequence of experiments.
It is also worth mentioning another ion dissociation method which has recently been used to obtain information on structure, namely surface induced dissociation, SID. With this method, a prepared surface is required which is attached near to the inner surface of an ion trap such as an ICR trap. This surface is usually inserted"

abstract: 'In this paper, we estimate the X-ray emission from close-in exoplanets. We show that the Solar/Stellar Wind Charge Exchange Mechanism (SWCX) which produces soft X-ray emission is very effective for hot Jupiters. In this mechanism, X-ray photons are emitted as a result of the charge exchange between heavy ions in the solar wind and the atmospheric neutral particles. In the Solar System, comets produce X-rays mostly through the SWCX mechanism, but it has also been shown to operate in the heliosphere, in the terrestrial magnetosheath, and on Mars, Venus and Moon. Since the number of emitted photons is proportional to the solar wind mass flux, this mechanism is not very effective for the Solar system giants. Here we present a simple estimate of the X-ray emission intensity that can be produced by close-in extrasolar giant planets due to charge exchange with the heavy ions of the stellar wind. Using the example of HD 209458b, we show that this mechanism alone can be responsible for an X-ray emission of $\approx 10^{22}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is $10^6$ times stronger than the emission from the Jovian aurora. We discuss also the possibility to observe the predicted soft X-ray flux of hot Jupiters and show that despite high emission intensities they are unobservable with current facilities.'

Introduction
============

X-ray emission has been observed for many of the Solar system objects, e.g. for Mars [@Holmstroem2001; @Gunell2004; @Dennerl2002], Venus [@Bhardwaj2007; @Dennerl2002b], Earth and the Moon [@Collier2014; @Bhardwaj2007], Jupiter and the Galilean satellites [@Cravens2003; @Bhardwaj2007], Saturn [@Branduardi-Raymont2010], comets [@Cravens2002; @Lisse2004], and in the heliosphere [@Cravens2001].

For the Solar system planets, X-rays are known to be generated via different mechanisms. The main mechanisms are:

– continuum Bremsstrahlung emission due to collisions with electrons (produces mostly hard X-rays);

– excitation of neutral species and ions due to collisions,"

332,19,2881,"The Last Will of Henry V & the Inheritance of an Empire

Henry V was not supposed to die on August 31, 1422. Not when he was only his 30s, not when his son was than a year old, and not when England was establishing a dual empire inclusive of France. The death itself was a national tragedy, one which would have had a huge impact on the health and viability of his successor’s reign regardless, but it was it was his final will and last-minute codicils that first drew the battle lines against which England found itself fighting for the next 60+ years.

Henry V’s reign was short and glorious – the perfect combination to help solidify his status as one of history’s legends. Two years after ascending the throne, he led the underdog English to victory at the famous Battle of Agincourt. Two years after that, he returned to take back what England believed was hers – Normandy and Aquitaine and, perhaps, France itself, depending on who you asked and when. To Henry, his return in 1417 was nothing short of a “reverse conquest,” and a taking of what was England’s by right – divine right.

By the winter of 1419, Rouen had fallen and in June 1420, King Charles VI displaced his son by naming Henry his heir via the Treaty of Troyes. The alliance was sealed with the marriage of Henry to Charles’s youngest daughter, Katherine of Valois. The couple returned to England, had Katherine crowned and before Henry returned to France in June 1421, Katherine was pregnant.

Henry wrote his will before he left England, as was custom for any king heading towards war. He knew full well that he would soon have a child to account for, but he clearly believed that he would live through the coming wave of his conquest, return home and outlive his aging father-in-law, Charles VI. In fact, he wouldn’t. In December 1421, Katherine gave birth to a son, and five months after that Katherine, accompanied by Henry’s younger brother, John, Duke of Bedford, joined him in France.

By then, Henry’s health was on the decline. Dysentery swept the English army in the autumn and winter, and by the time Meaux fell in May after a long siege, Henry is believed to have caught it. News of his poor health spread enough by July that public prayers were held in his honor. One his way to meet Philip, Duke of Burgundy, a stop was forced in Corbeil. He made it to the Ch"

This is why a master key, which has no additional code, opens everything — a concept familiar to anyone who's been walked in on by housekeeping.

If Tobias could collect enough room keys, he could compare their magnetic signatures and see what they had in common. Separate the common code from the extra information of individual room codes and voilà — he had a blueprint for a master key. In theory it was easy. But what was the next step?

Every Marc Weber Tobias problem is built with the basic assumption that all locks, however complicated, can be broken down into a series of simple steps; confront each in turn and you may break the lock. Now Tobias sat on the rented bedspread of Deerfield Beach Hotel, staring at the lock, breaking it down step-by-step in his mind. He knew he needed to compare the magnetic fingerprints of dozens of locks, which meant he first needed to collect those dozens of magnet fingerprints from locks up and down the hallway. This meant that he needed to invent a fast-and-dirty Showa hotel lock decoder, one small enough to fit through a credit card-sized key slot, and one smart enough to read those magnets, record the data, and present it all back to him. And he had to do it himself in his Florida hotel room.

By fixing the 5D Newton constant $G_5=\frac{3 L^3}{4}$, one can produce the proper splitting between the vector and axial vector Regge trajectories. The produced spectra of scalar $f_0$, pseudoscalar $\pi$, vector $\rho$ and axialvector $a_1$ are shown in Fig.\[pif0rhoa1-mass\] compared with experimental data [@pdg]. The experimental data for $f_0$ are chosen as in Ref.[@Gherghetta-Kapusta-Kelley]. With only 4 parameters, all produced meson spectra in the graviton-dilaton-scalar system agree well with experimental data. We would emphasize that our model can incorporate both chiral symmetry breaking and confinement properties in the hadron spectra, and the slope of Regge trajectories is $4\mu^2$ with $\mu=0.43 {\rm GeV}$. In a similar dynamical holographic QCD model in Ref. [@dePaula:2008fp], the linear Regge behavior is realized but the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism is missing.

The string tension of the linear quark potential.
-------------------------------------------------

Under the metric background $A_s(z)$ solved from Eq.(\[eom-aphikai\]) with the positive quadratic dilaton background and the scalar profile Eq.(\[chiz\]), the quark potential can be solved numerically. In the UV limit, one can derive the Coulomb potential $V_{\bar{q}q}=-\frac{0.23 g_p}{R_{\bar{q}q}}$ as given in Ref.[@Maldacena:1998im]. In the IR limit, we can get the linear potential $V_{\bar{q}q}=\frac{g_p}{2\pi} b_s^2(z_c) R_{\bar{q}q}$. From the solutions in Eq.(\[eom-aphikai\]), we have $b_s^2 \approx 4 \mu^2$, which indicates that the string tension of the linear quark potential $\sigma_s \sim 4 \mu^2$. The numerical result for the quark potential $V_{\bar{q}q}$ as a function of quark anti-quark distance $R_{qq}$ is shown by the solid line in Fig.\[Vqq\]. The two parameters are fixed as $g_p=2.3$ and $\mu=0.43 {\rm GeV}$. The result agrees with the Cornell potential (dot-dashed line) [@Cornell] $V^c(R)=-\frac{\kappa}{R}+\sigma_{str}R+V_0$ with $\kappa\approx

Can Democrats turn the Idaho panhandle purple?

In 2010, Democrats could have gone after Phil Hart. The Idaho state representative by then had federal liens placed on property for refusing to pay taxes. He now owes over half a million dollars in back taxes.

The only problem was, Democrats hadn’t shown up.

“Even though he was in real trouble, we didn’t have anyone on the ballot,” says Idaho Democratic Party Chair Larry Grant.

While Hart is gone — he lost his Republican primary this spring — Grant cites him as the inspiration for Democrats fielding candidates across the state this year. Idaho Democrats recruited more than 90 candidates, just in case “some [GOP] candidate is going to steal an RV or refuse to pay their taxes,” Grant says.

Democrats may need all the help they can get after the beating the party took in 2010 — losing its one congressional seat and three seats in the Legislature.

Regardless, the strategy of showing up this time extends to North Idaho. Democrats have a candidate this year in each of the nine legislative districts that include Kootenai County. In District 2 — Hart’s old stomping grounds, which runs north of Coeur d’Alene — Democrats are contesting all three legislative seats for the first time in more than 10 years. In fact, the man running for Hart’s open seat is the last Democrat to hold office in Kootenai County.

“Trying to make a change with Phil Hart,” is why Dan English filed to run for Hart’s now open seat. English, 61, has been a Coeur d’Alene city councilman and school board member. His election loss in 2010 as Kootenai County Clerk — a position to which he was appointed in 1995 and won the next four elections — also marked the end of Democrats holding a countywide position.

La police a durci le siège de l’Université polytechnique de Hongkong (PolyU), lundi 18 novembre, un peu avant l’aube, après plusieurs jours d’un blocage qui s’était considérablement tendu ce week-end.

Les « braves », surnom des manifestants qui se battent en première ligne, ont à leur disposition, sur place, des centaines de cocktails Molotov, avec lesquels ils ont réussi à mettre le feu à un camion blindé, et des tonnes de pavés, qu’ils lancent au bras ou à la catapulte, ainsi que des flèches tirées à l’arc… Mais c’est surtout en déclenchant un feu à l’une des entrées pour bloquer l’accès de la police que les occupants ont réussi à défendre leur position, lundi matin. L’annonce, vers minuit dimanche, que la police allait tirer à balles réelles et la circulation en ligne d’images des armes semi-automatiques entre les mains de policiers participant à l’opération ont déclenché une vague de panique et de soutien d’une partie de la population, inquiète pour ses jeunes présents sur le campus – quelques milliers, selon nos estimations. Des Hongkongais se sont alors rapprochés de la zone de tension, derrière les cordons de police, parfois pour bloquer les véhicules de police ou pour tenter des diversions.

Lundi matin, une nouvelle vague de citoyens en tenue de travail, ainsi que des manifestants, en noir de la tête aux pieds, ont afflué dans le quartier touristique de Tsim Sha Tsui, où ils ont dressé des barricades sur Nathan Road, afin de soutenir moralement les occupants de PolyU et compliquer la ­tâche de la police. Mais le noyau dur des manifestants retranchés à l’intérieur arrive à court d’option face au siège, désormais total, de la police, qui empêche tout ravitaillement. Dans la soirée, des dizaines de manifestants sont parvenus à s’échapper, descendant en rappel depuis une"

arbitrator as well, and did not. These facts decide the issue. The inclusion of a

conspiracy allegation does not “operate to change what would otherwise be

intrinsic fraud into extrinsic fraud.” Tracy v. Muir, 90 P. 832, 835 (Cal. 1907).

      There was also no connivance. For connivance to justify rescission, a

contracting party who enters into a contract under duress must show that another

contracting party, although not responsible for the duress, “knows that it has taken

place and takes advantage of it by enforcing the contract, particularly a contract

made with inadequate consideration.” Chan v. Lund, 116 Cal. Rptr. 3d 122, 134

(Ct. App. 2010) (citing Leeper v. Beltrami, 347 P.2d 12 (Cal. 1959) (en banc), as

modified on denial of reh’g (Dec. 30, 1989)), as modified on denial of reh’g (Oct.

28, 2010). State Fund cannot make such a showing. The 2010 Settlement

Agreements all contained a provision that stated that “[n]o party executed [the]

Agreement under duress, economic or otherwise.” Because any assertion that the

Zaks Defendants connived with respect to the 2010 Settlement Agreements

depends on the notion that Roth’s entry into the 2009 Agreement and Defendants’

attempt to enforce the 2009 Agreement coerced State Fund into entering the 2010

Agreements, this provision waives and thus forecloses State Fund’s connivance

argument.

      Finally, State Fund failed to take the additional steps required to effect

rescission under California law. State Fund failed to give notice of its intent to


                                          5
rescind the 2010 Settlement Agreements “promptly upon discovering the facts”

that it believed entitled it to rescission, and it never offered to restore everything of

value that it had received under these agreements. See Cal. Civ. Code § 1691.

State Fund’s failure to do so was substantially prejudicial to Defendants-Appellees.

See id. § 1693.

2.    The district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendant-

Appellee Bruce Roth because there was insufficient evidence of concerted action

between Roth and any other Defendant-Appellee. State Fund has failed to

establish essential elements of its RICO and RICO conspiracy claims: State Fund

has not introduced evidence to show that Roth was associated together with any

other Defendants-Appellees for a common purpose of engaging in a course of

conduct, and intended to participate in the association in fact.

3.    The district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendants-

Appellees Sana Ullah Khan; Physicians Mobile Medical Group, Inc.; Precision

Care Medical Group; True Imaging Medical Group; Windstar Medical Associates;

Crescent Diagnostic Medical Group, Inc.; and Crescent Comprehensive

Management, Inc. because State Fund’s claims against them were barred by the

four-year statute of limitations for civil RICO actions. See, e.g., Pincay v.

Andrews, 238 F.3d 1106, 1108 (9th Cir. 2001). State Fund has not introduced

evidence of new acts or injuries within the four years preceding this suit; a third-

As Seen On: Season 3, Episode 1: “Electronics Store”

Premise: In response to a local Best Buy using aggressive pricing to hijack customers from the little guy, Nathan clashes with the electronics behemoth by taking advantage of its “price match guarantee.”

Bennett Kogon

Present Day: While there is no longer a $1 sale on TVs and the alligator has returned home, the shop owner informed me that its appearance on Nathan for You has undoubtedly helped with business. Best Buy be damned: Speers TV lives on as one of the oldest operating independent businesses in South Pas.

Bennett Kogon

As Seen On: Season 3, Episode 5: “Smokers Allowed”

Premise: Looking for a loophole to circumvent California’s health regulations, Nathan finds a way to allow smoking in a public space by making it part of a theatrical production. By presenting a normal bar scenario as if it were a play, people visiting the 1881 Club would be able to smoke freely without concern of the law. He called it “Smokers Allowed.”

Present Day: There wasn’t even the slightest trace of smoke in the air. And yet, I was tempted to light up a cig just as the “actors” had done. I just wish someone had brought in a skateboard deck to show off.

L.A. Fame on Facebook

As Seen On: Season 2, Episode 2: “Souvenir Shop/ELAIFF”

Premise: To encourage commerce at one of the many souvenir shops along Hollywood Boulevard, Nathan stages the filming of a fake movie called The Web, starring a Johnny Depp impersonator passersby are allowed to believe is actually Johnny Depp. Those hoping to catch a glimpse are offered the opportunity to star as extras in the film. Their roles? Paying customers in a souvenir shop.

Present Day: Even though filming has wrapped,you can still purchase a variety of keychains and little plastic trophies from L.A. Fame knowing that it was the centerpiece of Nathan Fielder’s The Web. Now we just need to track down the Depp impersonator to autograph all of these mementos."

Due to the lack of literature of the effects of sleep and time-of-day effects on reliability, we did not have sufficient grounds to make predictions about this measure. However, because few variables have an appreciable effect on high confidence--accuracy \[[@RSOS170501C61]\], it seems reasonable to suppose that the same might be true of sleep. This investigation is a first step toward understanding how sleep may influence eyewitness identification performance.

2.. Material and Methods {#s2}
========================

2.1.. Participants {#s2a}
------------------

We used a sample size similar to other forensically relevant experiments in which discriminability and reliability were assessed (i.e. *n* = 1000 per condition) \[[@RSOS170501C25],[@RSOS170501C55]\]. Sensitivity analysis revealed that by setting the parameters to standard values of *α* = 0.0125 (corrected for each hypothesis test *α* = 0.05/4 = 0.0125) and 1−*β* = 0.95, *n* = 1000 per experimental condition can detect an effect size of *d* = 0.18 in a two-tailed test. Participants (*N* = 4000) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: wake (*n* = 1000), sleep (*n* = 1000), AM control (*n* = 1000) and PM control (*n* = 1000).^[2](#FN2){ref-type=""fn""}^ Participants were also randomly assigned to a target-present or target-absent line-up. When 4000 participants took part, data collection ceased. Royal Holloway, University of London Research Ethics Committee approved this study.

Participants were recruited online using the work source site Amazon Mechanical Turk \[[@RSOS170501C62]\]. To ensure good quality data, participation was limited to those who have hit approval rates of at least 85%. Approval rates are based on the quality of the responses on past tasks. Participant location was restricted to the US to ensure that data collection took place across only four time zones (Eastern Standard Time, Central Standard Time, Mountain Standard Time and Pacific Standard Time). Individuals had to meet the following criteria: age between 18 and 40 years; not currently diagnosed with any sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia, sleep apnoea), psychiatric disorder (e.g. depression, post-traumatic stress disorder), or neurological disorder (e.g. mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer\'s disease) that may affect memory \[[@RSOS170501C63]--[@RSOS170501C67]\]; not work as a shift worker; have not travelled across time zones within two weeks prior to participating; and not currently taking any prescribed medication that may affect sleep or memory.

2.2.. Materials {#s2b}
---------------

### 2.2.1.. Pre-screening questions {#s2b1}

The pre-screening questions included yes--no questions about the inclusion criteria listed above.

### 2.2.2.. Video {#s2b2}

The study material was a 35 s video featuring a young adult white male (the target) stealing a laptop and mobile phone from an empty office. The target\'s face was clear throughout the video.

### 2.2.3.. Line-ups {#s2b3}

The line-ups were six-person simultaneous photo line-ups. Target-present line-ups contained a photo of the target and five fillers, and target-absent line-ups contained six fillers. The fillers matched the description of the target, which were provided by participants (*n* = 19) who watched the video and answered questions about the target\'s appearance. The averaged descriptors were entered into the Florida Department of Corrections database \[[@RSOS170501C68]\], and photos of 100 individuals who matched were extracted and grey scaled. The target and fillers were randomized to appear in any of the six line-up positions.

Overall, we do not condone the use of our research in a manner that restricts the political or human rights of gay and bisexual men or any other group. “[14]

If (and I want to stress the if) the gay community is at greater risk from disease, then help and resources need to be provided to minimize and protect against that risk. It’s no different to the dangers of smoking or anything else that affects a section of society. As for the effect of homosexuality on others, I have not done any research into this. I think it would be harder on the child of a same-sex couple in school and the likely hood of bullying is probably greater. This is my own personal view based on my experiences of bullying which I was on the receiving end of for many years. That said, to use scientific data in an attempt to marginalize and ridicule a section of society is just hostile and not what science is for though like religion, it has been abused.

Where we stand today

If you back someone into a corner, chances are they will attack back and it seems that is now what is happening. This was highlighted by Will Young’s outburst on Question Time where he said anyone who speaks out against same-sex marriage should be imprisoned on hate crime charges.[15] It’s not just in Britain, in Australia there was a Q & A where David Marr branded the Bible’s stance as “bigotry and cruelty and hatred”. [16] Now these are likely to be the extreme ends of either view but like most things in the media, these are the ones that get the most attention. But it seems there is a shift in public perception, that if you don’t agree with someones views you must hate them. This seems to be an absurd stance to take. Disagreeing with someone is not the same as hating them and part of the problem is that people have forgotten the art of disagreement. Jesus respected and accepted everyone but he certainly did not always agree with what they were doing. As John Dickson put it;

“It was the genius of Jesus that he could flex two mental muscles at the same time: he could have deep convictions about right and wrong yet extend love and friendship to all regardless. This is a lost art. Nowadays, we either stop loving those we disagree with, or in the name of love, adjust our own moral convictions.” [17]

Words like “sinner” are thrown around by some Christians as if it doesn’t apply to them. But we are all sinners, that’s the whole reason Jesus had to do what he did. It’s by this notion that we endorse sin every day. Further claims of “you can be saved from the sin of homosexuality” rings very hollow to the thousands (if not more) Christians who are gay and just offensive to atheists. As Ravi Zacharias pointed out, it is completely possible to be possible to be a committed Christian and a homosexual [18] so the notion that homosexuality is something you can be saved from flies completely in the face of this.

The treatment of the gay community has been deplorable by some sections of Christians and the attacks on Christians by some sections of the gay community have been equally as horrendous. Until we can get to a position where both sides are less interested in throwing abuse and more in sensible discussion, the issue will continue to be a minefield and ultimately go no where. If you do have the chance to talk over the points, just remember you are talking to"

==========

With more than 2 million deaths a year, tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem. As one-third of the world\'s population is infected, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*is probably the most widespread human pathogen and the number of TB cases is growing at a rate of 2% per year \[[@B1]\]. This bacterium is remarkably well-adapted to its host, in which it can persist for years without inducing symptoms. Despite its worldwide dissemination and presence in diverse host populations, the genetic variability of *M. tuberculosis*appears to be very low with the exception of hot spot regions in the genome that are associated with mobile elements \[[@B2]-[@B5]\].

Previous studies on W-Beijing family strains have identified variations in putative DNA repair genes (*mutT2*, *mutT4*and *ogt*). These variations are found only in the W-Beijing family; they can therefore be considered to be specific markers of this family and suggest that a mutator phenotype, at least transient, may have contributed to the host adaptation of this family of strains \[[@B6]\].

Durbach et al. \[[@B7]\] co-inactivated DNA repair genes, namely *ada*/*alkA*and *ogt*, in strain H37Rv and showed that the resulting mutant displayed a mutator phenotype under nitrosative stress.

While studying the genetic diversity of *M. tuberculosis*isolates in the Central African Republic (CAR), we described an MDR-prone family characterized by a T family spoligotype and a synonymous variation in the DNA repair gene *mutT*1 \[[@B8]\]. This prompted us to screen our set of well-defined isolates from CAR \[[@B8],[@B9]\] by sequencing putative anti-mutator genes including *ada/alkA*to identify other variations that could be markers of relevant clinical strains.

Comparisons of CAR strain sequences with published \""*M. tuberculosis*complex\"" genome sequences revealed an SNP common to these strains and *M. bovis*strain AF2122. This suggests either horizontal DNA transfer between *M. bovis*and *M. tuberculosis*CAR strains or convergent evolution. Medigue et al. and Denamur et al. \[[@B10],[@B11]\] demonstrated horizontal transfer of DNA repair genes in *E. coli*. To determine whether there has been transfer between *M. bovis*and *M. tuberculosis*strains, we looked at polymorphism in the regions upstream and downstream from this common SNP by PCR sequencing. We provide evidence that this SNP may have occurred twice independently and might therefore be an example of convergent evolution.

Variations in the *ada/alkA* and *ogt* genes in a series of MDR isolates
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variations in *ada/alkA*and *ogt*genes were assessed in fifty-five MDR strains collected between 1993 and 2001 in CAR. PCR products corresponding to *ada/alkA*and those corresponding to *ogt*were obtained for each MDR CAR strain in our collection. Direct sequencing of PCR products revealed four variations in DNA repair genes: one in *ogt*and three in *ada/alkA*(table [1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}).

The *ogt*variant is a C to G substitution causing the replacement of a Threonine by a Serine at position 15 in Ogt, noted A CC→A GC (Thr15→Ser). This variation is carried by three CAR isolates. It has been previously observed in other strains and considered to be characteristic of Haarlem strains \[[@B6],[@B12]\].

356,29,14175,"8 Trends that Will Define the Future of Email Marketing: Webinar Recording

Email marketing has experienced great shifts in recent years, and is set to undergo dramatic changes before the end of the decade.

We explored the future of the channel in our recent Email Marketing in 2020 report, where we asked 20 experts to share their vision for how email will change over the next several years.

We recently hosted a webinar where Justine Jordan and I discussed the 8 most impactful trends from the report, which touches on everything from personalization and automation to inbox functionality and privacy.

Didn’t have a chance to make it to the webinar? Don’t worry—we recorded the whole thing!

Attendees of the live webinar had some great questions, we’ve answered here.

Can you define “Single View of the Customer”?
Chad: Having a single view of the customer allows your organization to see all interactions across all touchpoints. For instance, you’d be able to see all of a customer’s interactions with your emails, website, store, and call center all in one place. This kind of visibility allows more nuanced interactions, such as using store purchases to inform tailored product suggestions in your emails or suppressing marketing emails after a customer contacts the call center with a serious complaint in order to avoid an unsubscribe due to annoyance.

How do you balance the trends of interactivity and minimalism? Or put another way: How can emails of the future be both short, consumable emails and microsites?
Chad: While it sounds contradictory, an email can have simultaneously both incredibly rich functionality and very little. It’s accomplished through responsive design and use of multipart MIME.

So today, responsive design enables an email to adapt to the screen size that it’s viewed on and to the email client that it’s viewed on. In 2020, our concept of responsive will be much broader than the desktop > tablet > smartphone modes that we think of today. It will also include the microscreens of wearables and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, plus"

359,10,3178,"Why the NSA Called Me After Midnight and Requested My Source Code

The story behind my top secret coffee cup

Please listen carefully and don’t hang up. Those were the first words this unknown male caller said to me when my brother handed me the phone.

It was the July 4th weekend, 2000, give or take a day, and Mr. X knew to say that first because he was calling me after midnight at my brother’s house in Connecticut. This was beyond creepy because I lived in California and nobody knew I was in Connecticut except for my immediate family, who were all there with me in the house. I had only arrived the day before as I do most years about this time for our annual family picnic.

Why was this guy calling me?

It was a matter of national security.

The caller apologized for waking us up and said his name was Dave. He asked me to get a pen and paper because he was about to give me some important instructions that would allow me to confirm his identity. Then he dropped the bomb and said “it was a matter of national security.”

By now some of the other people in the house had started to gather around where I was standing in the kitchen by the wall-mounted phone. What the hell was going on? I signaled to my brother to bring me a pen — stat.

I was still trying to process what was going on, and strangely, I didn’t even have the frame of mind to ask Dave how he got this number. He sounded serious and spoke with an air of authority; I guess I was already convinced he was on the level.

Okay, I’m ready to write.

Dave told me he was with the NSA in Bethesda — the National Security Agency. He couldn’t say anything more until I called him back. This is why I needed the pen. He was about to give me a series of steps to follow to call him back in a way that proved his identity and cemented the"

The court held that an equitable subrogee need not delay seeking recovery from a third-party tortfeasor until the insured has exhausted her efforts to collect therefrom. Id., 626 N.Y.S.2d 994, 650 N.E.2d at 845. In reaching this conclusion, the court first recognized that the ""dual objective"" of the subrogation doctrine is to prevent double-recovery by the insured and ""to require the party who has caused the damage to reimburse the insurer for the payment the insurer has made."" Id., 626 N.Y.S.2d 994, 650 N.E.2d at 844. The court then acknowledged that ""[an] insurer's obligation runs to its insured, and then only to the extent of the policy limits."" Id. ""Thus, an insurer's action based on partial subrogation through its insured will not necessarily interfere with the insured's right to be made whole by the tortfeasor and... the insurer need not delay its subrogation claim against the third party to avoid impairing the insured's rights."" Id. In addition, the court discounted the possibility that an insurer's recoupment of its payout might result in ""unequal bargaining positions"" between the insured and the third-party tortfeasor's insurer by taking away the incentive of the latter to engage in settlement negotiations. Id., 626 N.Y.S.2d 994, 650 N.E.2d at 845. Finally, the court reasoned that ""i[f] the insurer is required to forego its rights while the insured delays in asserting its claim against the third party,... the delay may compel the insurer to litigate a stale claim, or worse, may result in its action being time barred."" Id.
The Court finds Winkelmann's holding and reasoning to be persuasive and adopts the rule enunciated therein in the absence of direct California authority. Moreover, the Court concludes that Winkelmann does not conflict with California case law on subrogation or the relevant public policy considerations underlying the made-whole rule.
The right of subrogation is, in essence, a means of balancing the equities as between the insurer, the insured, and the third-party tortfeasor. An insured who has suffered an injury has a legal right to be made whole; the made-whole rule is the legal doctrine that prevents insurers from interfering with that right. But where the insured has been fully compensated for his injury, subrogation ensures that the insured is not unjustly enriched by receiving a windfall. Subrogation's primary purpose, therefore, is to prevent the insured from obtaining double recovery. See Allstate Ins., 60 Cal.Rptr.3d at 789. Additionally"

OPINION
PETERSON, J.
Associated International Insurance Company (Associated) appeals from a judgment in favor of United States Elevator Corporation (USEC) on USEC's complaint for damages and declaratory relief. Associated claims the trial court erred when it held that it was responsible to pay certain claims against USEC under a contract of excess insurance. (1a) In reversing, we will hold that ambiguities existing in a *639 primary insurance contract must be construed so as to compel the broadest grant or expansion of insurance coverage thereunder; and that this rule of construction is not vitiated because its application may incidentally curtail or eliminate the coverage of a separate excess insurance contract issued by a separate insurance carrier, which had no responsibility for the ambiguity in the primary insurance contract.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
USEC manufactures, installs, services and maintains elevators. It is a subsidiary of Cubic Corporation (Cubic). Cubic purchased two policies of primary liability insurance extending coverage to USEC from Insurance Company of North America (INA). Coverage thereunder was effective as to the first policy from March 1, 1979, to March 1, 1980; and as to the second policy from March 1, 1980, to March 1, 1981. The material portions of these policies are identical.
For the same two years of insurance coverage provided under the INA policies, USEC was also insured by two successive excess liability insurance policies of Associated. In all material respects, these policies are also identical.
We will hereinafter sometimes refer to USEC as the ""insured"" under all of these primary and excess policies.

A. The INA Policies

The INA policies provided USEC with the following coverage: 1. Single Occurrence  Liability limits of $500,000 were provided for each single occurrence; i.e., for each accident occurring during the policy period resulting in a single loss or multiple losses, coverage was limited to $500,000.
2. Aggregate Limit  As here pertinent, the policies defined certain types of losses as a ""products hazard"" and ""completed operations hazard."" Such losses were subject to the aggregate limit of the policies which was a limit of $500,000 annual (policy year) liability. This aggregate limit applied to all such ""products hazard"" and ""completed operations hazard"" losses; i.e., INA's annual indemnity liability therefor was limited to $500,000, regardless of the number of such defined losses occurring as a result of an accident or accidents during the policy year.
3. Deductible Features  These policies were purchased with a deductible provision of $500,000, by which USEC, as the INA insured, was responsible *640 for payment of the first $500,000 of all losses resulting from each accident occurring during the policy periods; and by which USEC was further responsible for payment of the first $500,000 of those losses subject to the annual aggregate limit.
4. Effect of Deductible Features  The parties concede that the first effect of this $500,000 deductible provision of the policies was simply to leave USEC, as insured thereunder, with no indemnity coverage from INA as to any single occurrence, because the deductible $500,000 equaled the $500,000 liability limit INA had accepted under the policies; and that the further effect of this $500,000 deductible provision was to leave USEC with no indemnity coverage from INA as to the defined losses covered by the annual $500,000 aggregate limit, because the annual deductible of $500,000 equaled the $500,000 annual aggregate limit INA had accepted under the policies.
Thus, USEC only received for the primary insurance premium it paid INA the professional investigative and claims services of the latter as to all such occurrence claims, and all such claims subject to the aggregate limit, for injuries and damages arising under the INA policies. The premiums paid by USEC to INA were substantially less than USEC would have paid for the INA policies without the deductible feature above summarized.

B. The Associated Policies

The Associated policies were issued to extend indemnity"

(5th Cir. 2000). Bradford fails the first prong of the Reyes-Requena test such
that the district court properly construed his § 2241 petitions as a successive
§ 2255 motion. See Reyes-Requena, 243 F.3d at 904; Padilla, 416 F.3d at 425-26.
Thus, the district court properly transferred the successive motion to this Court.
             C.     Motion for Authorization
      Bradford separately moves for authorization to file a second or successive
§ 2255 motion. A prisoner must seek authorization from this Court before a
second or successive § 2255 motion may be filed in the district court. See
§ 2255(h); 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A). The movant must make a prima facie
showing that his proposed § 2255 motion relies upon either (1) “newly discovered
evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be
sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable
factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense” or ("

I’m sure I wasn’t the only person once upon a time who, hearing that Oliver Stone was making a movie called JFK starring Kevin Costner, assumed that it would be a biopic, with Costner playing the fallen president. When I eventually found out that the movie was going to be an investigation into the assassination itself, with the crusading New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison as its hero, I felt disappointment: Who wanted to watch another courtroom drama? We had courtroom dramas coming out our ears in the late eighties and early nineties.

I needn’t have worried. Stone’s film turned out to be more than a legal procedural. First and foremost, of course, it was a controversy magnet. Stone endorsed (more than endorsed — magnified and dramatized and even melodramatized) Garrison’s elaborate conspiracy theory that Kennedy had been killed by a massive cabal involving the military-industrial complex, the U.S. intelligence apparatus, shady Southern businessmen, Lyndon B. Johnson, “the homosexual underworld,” and a host of other players who were peeved at the young president’s efforts to roll back the American war machine and the nascent military effort in Vietnam. The film portrayed Garrison as an earnest, Capra-esque hero who just wanted his country back from the war mongers.

But in many ways, Garrison was just a vessel. The real attraction in JFK was the film’s densely packed, kaleidoscopic whirr of mixed-media imagery – golden-hued cinematography cut with newsreel cut with fake newsreel cut with still shots cut with flashbacks cut with re-creations. Here"
369,3,227,"^1$ function $Y=Y(t,\,x)$ such that $X-Y$ has a local maximum at $(t_0,\,n_0)$, without loss of generality, we assume $X(t_0,\,n_0)-Y(t_0,\,n_0)=0$, take the plane $t=t_0$ (see Figure \[mathproof\]).

![Graphs of $X(t_0,\,\cdot)$ and $Y(t_0,\,\cdot)$[]{data-label=""mathproof""}](viscosity.pdf){width=""45.00000%""}

Since $X-Y$ attains a local maximum at $(t_0,\,n_0)$, by (\[twoside\]) there must hold $Y_n(t_0,\,n_0) <0$. By continuity, there exists a neighborhood $\Omega_1$ of $(t_0,\,n_0)$ such that $ Y_n(t,\,n)<0,~~\forall (t,\,n)\in\Omega_1$. Then, we may define $M(t,\,\cdot)$ to be the inverse of $Y(t,\,\cdot)$ in $\Omega_1$. Obviously, $M(t,\,n)\in C^1(\Omega_1)$, and $N-M$ attains a local maximum at $\big(t_0,\,X(t_0,\,n_0)\big)$. Using the fact that $N(t,\,x)$ is a viscosity solution and applying (\[subsol\]), we deduce M\_t(t,x)  f(-M\_x(t,x)) Differentiating with respect to $t$ the identity $Y\big(t,\, M(t,\,x)\big)=x$, and using (\[a\]), we have 0 = Y\_t + Y\_nM\_t  Y\_t+Y\_nf(-M\_x) = Y\_t+Y\_nf(-[1Y\_n]{})  = Y\_t-(-Y\_n) In the above deduction, we have used the fact that $M(t,\,\cdot)$ and $Y(t,\,\cdot)$ are both $C^1$, and are inverse of each other. Therefore, differentiating $n=M\big(t,\,Y(t,\,n)\big)$ w.r.t. $n$ yields $1=M_x\cdot Y_n$.

Since $Y$ is arbitrary, (\[b\]) implies that $X(t,\,n)$ is a subsolution. The case for supersolution is completely similar.

Similar proof can be used to show the converse: given a viscosity solution $X(\cdot,\,\cdot)$ to (\[eqn2\]), $N(t,\,\cdot)$ obtained by inverting $X(t,\,\cdot)$ is a viscosity solution to (\[eqn1\]).

Numerical algorithm and value conditions {#BJF}
========================================

In this section, we focus on the numerical scheme for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation \_t X(t,n)-(-\_n X(t"
370,25,3899,"S_n)}$ for each $n$. (As we shall see, the operators $\mathfrak O^k(\alpha)$ turn out to be the counterpart of the Chern character operators in [@LQW1].) The idea of relating Jucys-Murphy elements to vertex operators has been used in [@LT] in the study of class functions of symmetric groups. In particular, when $X$ is a point, the operator $\mathfrak O^1$ reduces to the Goulden’s operator [@Gou] which admits a vertex operator interpretation [@FW].

By studying the interaction of the operators $\mathfrak
O^k(\alpha)$ and Heisenberg operators, we are able to verify all the axioms. Therefore, as formal consequences of the axiomatization, we obtain the counterparts in the symmetric product setup of all the main results for the cohomology rings of Hilbert schemes in \[[**LQW1-4**]{}\]. Namely, we prove that $O^k(\alpha,n)$, as $0 \le k <n$ and $\alpha$ runs over a linear basis of $H^*(X)$, form a set of ring generators of ${H^*_{\text{orb}}(X^n/S_n)}$. We also show that there is another set of ring generators in terms of Heisenberg algebra generators. We establish the stability of the ring ${H^*_{\text{orb}}(X^n/S_n)}$, which tells us in what sense the orbifold cup product on ${H^*_{\text{orb}}(X^n/S_n)}$ is independent of $n$. We further obtain a description of the operators $\mathfrak O^k(\alpha)$ as the zero mode of a certain explicit vertex operator when $X$ has a positive dimension. (Such a description has been given in [@LT] when $X$ is a point. There is however a remarkable difference between these two cases.) The components of these vertex operators generate a ${{\mathcal W}}$ algebra acting on ${{\mathcal F}_X}$. The description of the operator $\mathfrak O^k(\alpha)$ as the zero mode of a certain explicit vertex operator provides us a new way to construct a sequence of Frobenius algebra $\mathfrak F_A^n$ starting from a Frobenius algebra $A$, cf. Remark \[orbrem:zeromode\]. (Compare with the different construction in [@LS2] of the Frobenius algebra $A^{[n]}$).

For a global quotient $M/G$, we introduce a deformed orbifold cup product on $H^*_{\text{orb}}(M/G)$ (actually first on $H^*(M,G)$) depending on a rational (or complex, if we consider the orbifold cohomology group with ${ \mathbb C }$-coefficient) parameter $t$. This reduces to the original construction in [@CR] for $t=1$, and to the construction of [@FG] (also cf. [@LS2]) for $t=-1$. In the case of symmetric products, we explain how the parameter $t$ is reflected in terms of some modifications on Heisenberg algebra and vertex operators. By comparing our results on the symmetric products with results on Hilbert schemes in [@LQW1], we obtain a new proof of the ring isomorphism between ${H^*({ X^{"

373,22,16658,"Only foolish snobs don’t believe in William Shakespeare

A new film about the Bard merely fuels the absurd conspiracy theories that
surround our best loved plays.

What do Shakespeare, Keats and Dickens have in common, apart from being great writers, and masters of the English language? The answer is pretty obvious. None of them went to university: to some extent, all three were self-educated. Ben Jonson said that Shakespeare had “small Latin and less Greek”, and likewise I don’t think Dickens and Keats, despite the latter’s Ode to a Grecian Urn, had much of either.

Who is the odd one out, then? Just as easy? Nobody, I think, has ever suggested Keats didn’t write that ode and others, or that Dickens wasn’t the author of Bleak House and Great Expectations. But Shakespeare – ah, Shakespeare – there’s a whole industry devoted to trying to prove that somebody else wrote his plays. So here we go again, with a movie from Roland Emmerich, director of Godzilla, called Anonymous, opening on Friday. The “Shakespearean thriller” hands the authorship to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, whom the movie, incredibly, has as the love-child and incestuous lover of Queen Elizabeth.

Never mind that Oxford died in 1604, some years before Shakespeare’s last plays were written and produced. Such considerations are a mere bagatelle when conspiracies are being revealed. Never mind that nobody at the time attributed the authorship to anyone but the man from Stratford. Evidently, they were all fooled, even Ben Jonson, a fellow playwright who knew William Shakespeare and was not devoid of jealousy.

It is not hard to guess at the director’s interest in the authorial conspiracy. But what of those not thinking of box office returns? Snobbery is the reason for their nonsense. The “uneducated” Shakespeare, an actor and theatre manager, who attended neither Oxford nor Cambridge, could not – could he? – have had all the knowledge of Greece and Rome and Italy etc displayed in the plays.

This argument falls flat for three reasons. First, the knowledge isn’t that great. Almost all the stuff in the Roman plays is taken – cribbed, if you like – from North’s translation of Plutarch’s Lives. Indeed, some of the great speeches in Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra are no more than versifications of North’s prose. There are many lines in the plays which suggest that the author had read Ovid’s works, but this required no knowledge of Latin. Arthur Golding’s marvellous translation of the Metamorphoses was available to him. However, Shakespeare did make mistakes which a better-educated and well-travelled man such as Oxford might not have made. His knowledge of Italian geography is patchy, and he thought Bohemia had a sea-coast.

Second, and more to the point, is the evidence that the plays were written by a working man of the theatre. Sources in the shape of old plays, novels, stories, histories and chronicles have been found for all of them. T S Eliot argued that the problem with Hamlet was that Shakespeare found difficulty in reconciling the original revenge play, which he was refashion"

Burn-in, as it applies to televisions, is bad. Burn-in describes a form of image retention where the screen permanently retains an image even when it's no longer being displayed. Watch too much CNBC, and eventually the outline of that stock ticker is going to burn into the display. Burn-in as it applies to headphones, on the other hand, is good--according to some audiophiles, who swear that new cans need to be burned in for 40 or 100 or 200 hours before regular use. But not everyone agrees. ""Please stop burning in your earphones,"" Wired writes. ""Earphone burn-in is a bunch of hokum.""

Wired's Bryan Gardiner explains ""There's zero evidence this does anything but defer your enjoyment of music and add more confusion to an already complex topic."" Burning in a new pair of headphones involves playing music or sound on them continuously for dozens or hundreds of hours, often loops of white noise or pink noise or sweeping tones.

The ""why"" behind burn-in has to do with the earphone drivers. Burn-in proponents argue that drivers become more flexible after some use, altering the sound they produce. Supposedly, the burn-in period improves the headphone sound, or at least has them arriving at the sound they will deliver for the rest of their life. But Wired argues it's a waste of time.

""As with many of the numinous subjects in the audiophile realm, this odd little custom sits squarely at the intersection of psychology, science, marketing, and that eternally subjective thing known as'sound quality.' And that makes it particularly troublesome,"" Gardiner writes. ""Matt Engstrom, director of monitoring products at Shure, admits there is evidence that suggests transducers in larger headphones can experience burn-in, and that this could, in theory, produce different sound over time. Again, no one has shown this conclusively, largely because a) companies aren't rushing to tell audiophiles they've been wrong all these years and b) there's no single industry standard for testing headphones.""

So there's no industry-wide conclusive standard for burning in. There's little real data about the process. That doesn't mean it's completely pointless. At Inner Fidelity, audio expert Tyll Hertsens tested two AKG Q701s, headphones infamous for needing long multi-hundred hour break-in periods. He burned in one pair of headphones for 90 hours, measuring and listening along the way. He left another pair pristine. The charts Hertsens made do show some change over time in the sounds produced by the headphones, but not enough to convince him that the burn-in process was responsible for those changes.

""While the data showed only very small differences, the data was clearly above the noise, and a general trend observable,"" he writes. ""While, it seems to me, much of the change observed could easily be due to movement, especially in the frequencies above 5kHz, some changes seem more likely due to break-in. In particular, the changes in frequency response around the fundamental resonance of the driver at 80Hz, and in %[Total Harmonic Distortion]+noise at the same frequency and at around 40Hz.""

Later he performed a single-blind test and was able to distinguish between a broken-in pair of Q701s from a pair that hadn't been burned in. Hertsens writes:

""It's clear to me, having had the experience, that there is indeed an audible difference when breaking-in a pair of Q701 headphones. I've seen measured differences, and now experienced audible differences. While the measured differences are small, I believe the human"

HANLEY, J.
The sole issue on this appeal is as follows: Was the defendant's answer sufficient either to negate the essential allegations of the plaintiff's complaint or to raise an affirmative defense thereto?
The plaintiff's contention here, as in the trial court, is that the defendant's answer was comprised of negative pregnants and was insufficient to place the allegations of the complaint in issue.[2]
Negative pregnants occur in responsive pleadings where, as in the instant answer, the denials are stated in the very words employed in the complaint. Such denials *578 were condemned by this court as early as Schaetzel v. Germantown Farmers' Mut. Ins. Co., supra, because they are pregnant with alternative admissions to the allegations of the complaint. An examination of the denials contained in defendant's answer reveals that, although they are not framed in the exact words of the complaint, the similarity is indeed striking. The most crucial shortcoming of the defendant's answer, however, is its admission that he executed the written instrument, which was under seal, yet failed to allege an affirmative defense to its collection.
Under sec. 891.27, Stats., a seal upon an executory instrument is presumptive evidence of sufficient consideration. See: Estate of Cortte (1939), 230 Wis. 103, 106, 283 N. W. 336; Spankus v. West (1936), 222 Wis. 238, 267 N. W. 910. It is defendant's contention on this appeal that denial of the receipt of the $2,000 and denial that a loan was made constitute the inferential allegation of gift as a defense. In support of this contention, he relies upon sec. 263.27, Stats., which states:
""Pleadings liberally construed. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.""
While it is true that pleadings are to be liberally construed, sec. 263.13, Stats., states:
""The answer of the defendant must contain:
""(1)...
""(2) A statement of any new matter constituting a defense, in ordinary and concise language, without repetition."" (Emphasis supplied.)

Como passar cada linha de resultado  para uma variável?

A:

Para armazenar cada linha de resultado em uma variável, basta criar um array e adicionar as linhas nele:
$variavel = array();
while ($linha = mysql_fetch_assoc($resultado))
    $variavel[] = $linha;

Deste modo, todos os valores retornados pela query ficarão armazenados em $variavel, que poderá ser utilizada da maneira que achar melhor.
Colocando os Valores em Variáveis Completamente Diferentes
Com exceção de alguns casos muito específicos, sendo que só me vem a mente o desenvolvimento de Frameworks com carregamento dinâmico de módulos ou classes, ou algo do tipo, não vejo vantagem alguma em se fazer isso, se tratando de uma gambiarra nos demais usos.
Mas, aí vai.
Você pode construir o nome de uma variável em uma string, e então referenciar a variável com este nome duplicando o operador $. Por debaixo do pano, o que o PHP faz é simplesmente substituir a variável do tipo string, pelo seu conteúdo, e então referenciar o novo nome de variável. Este procedimento pode ser realizado várias vezes, inclusive.
Implementação:
$contador = 0;
while ($linha = mysql_fetch_assoc($resultado)) {
    $nome = ""variavel"". $contador++; // criamos o nome da variável.
    $$nome = $linha; // criamos a variável propriamente dita.
}

// deste momento em diante, podemos referenciar diretamente as variáveis. Mas devemos tomar cuidado para saber QUAIS variáveis estão definidas e não.

// assumindo que pelo menos 3 linhas foram buscadas no banco de dados, o seguinte có"

Fedde Schurer (West Frisian pron. [ˈfɛdə ˈskyːrər]; Dutch pron. [ˈfɛdə ˈsxyːrər]) (Drachten, 25 July 1898 – Heerenveen, 19 March 1968) was a Dutch schoolteacher, journalist, language activist and politician, and one of the most influential poets in the West Frisian language of the 20th century.

Life and career
From 1904 on, Schurer grew up in the Frisian fishing village of Lemmer, and from a young age worked as a carpenter. Through self-education in the evenings he studied to become a schoolteacher, and in 1919, he was appointed in that position to the local Christian elementary school in Lemmer. His wife Willemke ""Willy"" de Vries, who was also a schoolteacher, and his colleague at this school, he had actually met when he was still a carpenter's apprentice, as she was the girl who delivered the newspaper at the carpenter's workshop everyday. Schurer and Willy were married on 1 July 1924.

In 1930, his openly pacifist stance caused Schurer to lose his job, after which he moved to Amsterdam, where he was appointed to a state-run school. He was a talented orator, and his pacifist and socialist views were seen as a danger to society at that time, which is why the BVD, the Dutch secret service, started a file om him. Schurer joined the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), a Christian-socialist splinter party, and in 1935–1936 he served as a member of the provincial assembly of North Holland for a year. In World War II he was involved with the Dutch resistance in Amsterdam, where his house was used as a temporary hiding place for people wanted by the Nazis, before they could be smuggled out of the city.

After the war, Schurer returned to Friesland, where he lived in Heerenveen, and worked as a journalist. Like most people from Friesland, he was a native West Frisian speaker, and from a young age he had been an ardent supporter of his mother tongue. When in several court cases in Friesland in 1950 and 1951 the judge denied the defendants the right to speak Frisian, Schurer wrote a sharply worded editorial rebuke in the Friese Koerier newspaper. He was then charged with slandering the judge, and had to appear in court on Friday, 16 November 1951, in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden, together with another journalist, Tsjebbe de Jong, who stood accused of the same offence.

On the Zaailand square, in front of the Leeuwarden Palace of Justice, a large crowd gathered that day. There were some supporters of Schurer (among them renowned Frisian authors like Douwe Tamminga, Anne Wadman and Eeltsje Boates Folkertsma), some Frisian nationalists, members of the Frisian-language press (who weren't allowed in the court-room) and a group of students carrying plackards, but it happened to be market day that day, and a lot of the people there were simply market goers who came over to see what all the fuss was about.

10 years ago today, on Thursday 11th March 2004, 191 people died in a ""terrorist"" attack on a train in Madrid. A small group of radical Islamists, connected in some way to Al Qaeda, left rucksacks loaded with explosives on a packed commuter train, and then presumably got off (not for them the Paradise and Virgins promised for freedom fighters apparently).

And basically that's all that matters, that 191 people's lives were wasted and hundreds of families destroyed forever - all for nothing.

As I think this is the main point of today's commemoration and I have nothing further to add, I wasn't going to blog about it today - but reading many comments and interviews with families of the victims, I have realised that many people outside of Spain do not know the other aspect to this story which has filled Spanish news on and off ever since that dreadful day....

Background: for some still surprising reason to me, the Spanish government had previously abandoned its traditional role as a meeting point for cultures and religions, and thrown its hat in with Blair and Bush when they decided to invade Iraq in the search for pink unicorns, or was it weapons of mass destruction? This decision was very controversial and led to demonstrations of millions of Spaniards (and Catalans) demanding Spain keep out of that war.

Introduction.
=============

The classical Brunn-Minkowski theorem is an inequality for the volumes of convex sets. It can be formulated as a statement about how the volumes of the vertical $n$-dimensional sections of a convex body in $\R^{n+m}$ vary with the section; more precisely it says that the $n$:th root of the volumes define a concave function on $\R^m$. The theorem has many applications, and it has also been generalized in many different directions ( see e. g. the survey, [@Gardner]).

One important generalization is Prékopa’s theorem, [@Prekopa], which can be seen as a version of the Brunn-Minkowski theorem for convex functions instead of convex sets. Let $\phi(x,t)$ be a convex function on $\R^n_x\times \R^m_t$, satisfying some mild extra conditions. We define a new function on $\R^m$ by $$e^{-\tilde\phi(t)} =\int_{\R^n} e^{-\phi(t,x)} dx.$$ Then Prékopas theorem says that $\tilde\phi$ is also convex. Measures of the type $$e^{-\phi} dx,$$ where $\phi$ is convex, are called [*log concave* ]{}, and in this terminology Prékopa’s theorem says that the marginals, or push forwards, of log concave measures are log concave. If we admit convex functions that attain the value $\infty$, the Brunn-Minkowski theorem is a direct consequence of Prékopa’s theorem, corresponding to the case when $\phi$ is the indicator function of a convex body, i. e. the function which is zero on the convex body and infinity outside. (Properly speaking we get a version of the Brunn-Minkowski theorem with $n$:th roots replaced by logarithms. This is the ’multiplicative version’ of the Brunn-Minkowski theorem, and is easily seen to be equivalent to the ’additive version’.)

Among the many different proofs of Prékopa’s theorem, the one that is relevant to us here is the proof of Brascamp and Lieb, [@Brascamp-Lieb]. It goes by first proving the [*Brascamp-Lieb inequality*]{}, which is a Poincaré inequality for the $d$-operator (on functions). In the case when $n=1$ (which is really the main case) it says the following: Let $u$ be a smooth function on $\R$, satisfying $$\int_\R u e^{-\phi(x)} dx =0,$$ where $\phi$ is a smooth function, which is strictly convex in the sense that $\phi''>0$. Then $$\int_\R |u|^2 e^{-\phi} dx\leq \int_\R\frac{|u'|^2}{\phi''} e^{-\phi}dx.$$ From this, Prékopa’s theorem (and therefore also the Brunn-Minkowski theorem) follows just by differentiating $\tilde\phi$ twice, and applying the Brascamp-Lieb inequality to estimate the result. Actually, the two results are ‘equivalent’ in the sense that the Brascamp-Lieb theorem follows from Prékopa’s theorem too. ( See [@Dario-Boaz], which also gives a nice complement to the oversimplified historical picture described above.)

Now we observe that the Brascamp-Lieb inequality is the real variable version of Hörmander’s $L^2$-estimate for the $\dbar$-operator, [@Hormander], [@Demailly"

The present invention relates to a parallax barrier LCD, and more particularly, to a system for controlling brightness flicker of a parallax barrier LCD having a wide viewing angle that is capable of minimizing the brightness flicker by adjusting a permittivity curve depending on different times into a predetermined waveform when split barriers are on/off by movement of a viewer's viewing angle, and a method thereof.
(b) Description of the Related Art
Various methods for a technology relating to a stereoscopic display using binocular disparity are being proposed. One of representative methods allows a viewer to acquire a cubic effect by installing a lenticular lens or a parallax barrier spaced by a predetermine distance on a 2D image panel to cause different image information to be transmitted to a viewer's left and right eyes.
In the stereoscopic display technology using the lenticular lens, left and right images are arranged on a focus surface of a lens called a semi-cylindrical lenticular screen in a stripe pattern, and the left and right images are split depending on the directionality of a lens plate through the lens to allow the viewer to view a stereoscopic image without glasses.
The width of one lens is determined by a pixel width of a display device. Two pixels respectively corresponding to the left and right eyes are provided to allow a pixel at the left side of the lens to be viewed by only a right eye and a pixel at the right side of the lens to be viewed by only a left eye, thereby splitting the left and right images.
In the stereoscopic display technology using the parallax barrier, thin stripe vertical slits for transmitting or shielding light are arranged between a viewer's eye and an image at a regular interval and left and right images are alternately disposed at the front or back of the slits by an appropriate interval, and as a result, the left and right images are optically split when the image is viewed through the slit at a predetermined location, causing the viewer to acquire the cubic effect.

For each individual vibrational mode, the maximum enhancement can be obtained when the energy of the excitation laser is in the middle of the Raman shift and the LSPR spectral maximum, where both the incident and Raman scattered photons can be strongly enhanced. Therefore, not all the vibrational modes of molecules can be uniformly enhanced in one SERS test \[[@B21-sensors-15-10422],[@B22-sensors-15-10422]\]. These understandings are important for rational design and optimization of SERS substrates.

### 1.2.2. Chemical Enhancement

The electromagnetic enhancement mechanism cannot fully explain the magnitude of SERS enhancement. Evidences showed that there should be a second enhancement mechanism which works independently of the electromagnetic enhancement. For instance, the SERS intensities of CO and N~2~ molecules differ by a factor of 200 at the same experimental conditions \[[@B23-sensors-15-10422]\], while electromagnetic enhancement should not depend on molecular species.

These observations can be explained by a resonance Raman mechanism (chemical enhancement) in which the new electronic states arising from chemisorption serve as resonant intermediate states in Raman scattering. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the adsorbate can be symmetrically positioned in the energy band diagram with respect to the Fermi level of the metal ([Figure 2](#sensors-15-10422-f002){ref-type=""fig""}). In this case charge-transfer excitation (either from the metal to the molecule or vice versa) can occur at around half of the energy of the intrinsic excitation energy of the adsorbate, which greatly increase the number of excited electrons and thus Raman signal. Research showed that the magnitude of the chemical enhancement is usually 10--100 \[[@B23-sensors-15-10422]\].

Researchers worked on the development of a comprehensive theory to describe the SERS enhancement mechanisms and factors for a long time. Recently, Lombardi *et al*. \[[@B24-sensors-15-10422]\] derived a single expression for SERS enhancement based on Herzberg-Teller coupling, which includes contributions from: (1) the surface plasmon resonance in the metal nanoparticle; (2) a charge-transfer resonance involving transfer of electrons between molecules and the conduction band of the metal; and (3) resonances within the molecules themselves. In the study, they demonstrated that the three types of resonances were tightly bonded by Herzberg-Teller vibronic coupling terms and could not be treated individually. However, they did not consider the non-resonance changes in the molecular polarizability that occurs upon adsorbing to the metal surface. Valley and his co-workers \[[@B25-sensors-15-10422]\] studied both normal and surface-enhanced Raman spectra for a set of substituted benzenethiols. They found that the enhancement obtained by experiments varies by a factor of 10 as a result of chemical substitution. Stronger electron donating groups on the benzene unit lead to higher enhancement. The experimental results agree well with the calculation from the static polarizability derivatives determined by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).

Constantine Joseph Beschi (8 November 1680 – 4 February 1747), also known under his Tamil name of Vīramāmunivar, was an Italian Jesuit priest, missionary in South India, and Tamil language littérateur.

Early years
Born in Castiglione delle Stiviere, Beschi got his secondary education in the Jesuits' High School at Mantua. After becoming a Jesuit in 1698, he was trained in Ravenna and Bologna from where he requested and obtained, from Superior General Michelangelo Tamburini, permission to be sent to the Jesuit mission at Madurai in South India. Sailing from Lisbon he reached Goa in October 1710, from where he proceeded immediately to South India. He arrived in Madurai in May 1711.

In South India
Inspired by what was done in China, Beschi adopted the native Tamilians' lifestyle in his life and in his missionary work. For example, he adopted the saffron coloured robe generally worn by a sannyaasi (Indian ascetic). He visited several important centres such as Tirunelveli, Ramanaathapuram, Thanjaavur and, of course, Madurai to learn the Tamil language. He met with persecution in 1714–15 and escaped a death sentence. This gave him more time to master the Tamil language in which he soon showed great proficiency.

During the first six years, he worked as a missionary in Elakurichy, a town near Tiruvaiyaru. Then he served as parish priest in Kamanaayakkanpatti, one of the oldest mission centres in Tamil Nadu. He worked in the Thanjaavur area till 1738 and settled in 1740 on the Coromandel coast where he remained till the end of his life.

He helped build the Poondi Matha Basilica at Poondi near Thanjavur, Vyaagula Mathaa Church at Thanjaavur, The Periyanaayagi Maatha Shrine, Konankuppam at Mugasaparur in Konankuppam, and Adaikala Maatha Shrine at Elakurichi. These churches are now Catholic pilgrim centres.

He died at Ambalakkaadu in Thrissur, Kingdom of Cochin (now a part of the state of Kerala), and is buried at Sampaloor, where his tomb can be seen.

Contribution to Tamil literature

Constantine compiled the first Tamil lexicon - a Tamil-Latin dictionary. He also compiled the comprehensive Chaturakarati (ச�"

Before and at the time of the accident, the doors had a low-energy electric hydraulic operator. The door consists of swinging doors that open outward and then return to a closed position. The door had a timer that was set to open for a predetermined time delay. The door, however, also operated just as any other manual door in that a spring closed the door. The door did not close under electric power. Thus, a person could exit either manually or through the automatic feature. In the automatic feature, once the door begins to close, a person would need to manually re-open the door by using physical or kinetic force. If the door closed after the predetermined time delay, a person assisting someone holding a walker would be unable to make the door reopen automatically. *689 He did not recall the time delay, but estimated that it was approximately the ""normal"" time of fifteen seconds.
Mr. Borgardt testified that, in September 2006, a different operating system was installed. This consisted of a safety sensor package, mats, and a motion sensor. Although the new system would be safer for one-legged people than the low-energy operating system, this did not mean that the low-energy operating automatic door was defective or that its design was not good for the use for which it was intended. As the door currently exists, it will not close on a person.

INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL
The present matter actually involves an involuntary dismissal under La. C.C.P. art. 1672:
B. In an action tried by the court without a jury, after the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his evidence, any party, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal of the action as to him on the ground that upon the facts and law, the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court may then determine the facts and render judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the moving party or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.
The standard of review of an involuntary dismissal was stated by this Court as follows:
When a motion for dismissal at the close of the plaintiffs evidence is made, the trial court should apply the preponderance of evidence standard in weighing and evaluating the evidence.
Proof by a preponderance of the evidence means that, taking the evidence as a whole, such proof shows that a fact sought to be proved is more probable than not..... Under article 1672, the trial judge may grant a motion for involuntary dismissal when the plaintiff has failed to show a right to relief..... In non-jury trials, the appropriate standard for the trial court's determination of a motion to dismiss pursuant to art. 1672(B) is whether the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish his claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Our review of the trial court's determination is based on the manifest error standard....[1]

HEARSAY
During Ms. Cornman's direct examination, Mrs. Graffs counsel attempted to elicit testimony that, after the accident, Ms. Ream told Ms. Cornman that the staff was worried about the door prematurely closing on people and there were such instances that occurred before the accident. Specifically, counsel asked whether, after the accident, Ms. Cornman discussed the accident with Ms. Ream. Ms. Cornman replied, ""Well, you know, the day that I fell, [Ms. Ream] mentioned that that had happened[.]"" The Hospital objected on the basis of hearsay.
The trial judge sustained the Hospital's objection to hearsay testimony and allowed Mrs. Graff to make a proffer of proof outside of the presence of the judge. Mrs. Graff argues that the trial court erred by refusing to allow the testimony.
On the proffer, Ms. Cornman testified that she spoke to Ms. Ream on the date of the accident and afterwards. When asked whether Ms. Ream told Ms. Cornman that,"

The ""pattern-and-practice"" probe, as it's known, will focus on use of force, deadly force, accountability and how the Chicago Police Department ""tracks and treats"" those incidents, she said.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he welcomes the investigation and promised the city's total cooperation in achieving the ""mutual goal"" of keeping Chicago safe while respecting citizens' rights.

""Nothing is more important to me than the safety and well-being of our residents and ensuring that the men and women of our Police Department have the tools, resources and training they need to be effective crime fighters, stay safe and build community trust,"" Emanuel said in a statement.

He later told reporters that the city will be made better because of the investigation.

""We accept it, and we need it,"" he said, describing the current moment as an inflection point.

""None of the measures we have taken have ever measured up to the seriousness, the scope, the scale of the challenge in front of us as a city,"" Emanuel said.

City, department under fire

Word of the federal probe comes about two weeks after police released the October 2014 video of Officer Jason Van Dyke fatally shooting Laquan McDonald on a Chicago street, and it comes after reports released by the city over the weekend indicate that accounts from police on the scene appear to contradict what the footage shows

The video of McDonald's fatal shooting outraged many Chicagoans, who took to the streets to protest what they felt was an excessive use of force and dishonesty by the city and Van Dyke's fellow officers, who initially accused McDonald of threatening officers. The demonstrators also questioned why it took more than 400 days to release the video, despite the city paying McDonald's mother $5 million in April.

The spotlight on the case shone bright enough to illuminate another case -- that of Ronald Johnson, who was killed by police eight days before McDonald's death. Video from that incident was shown to reporters Monday, as Emanuel promised"

404,20,5567,"With the 2010s at their end, our “Redemption Decade” series explores how California’s economy rebounded from the destruction of the Great Recession. This is Part 2, on housing.

California’s fierce debate over high-cost housing says volumes about the state’s recovery from the real estate crash of a decade ago. Bad bets on high-risk mortgage lending put property owners in deep financial distress and slashed overall values.

Here’s how my trusty spreadsheet sets the scene:

Then: California’s median sales price of an existing single-family home tumbled 21% in 2009 to $274,960 after falling 38% the year before, stats from the California Association of Realtors show. Rents — as measured by an average of consumer price data for Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego — rose 2.4% in ’09 compared to 4.4% in 2008 before falling (yes, rents were falling) 0.1% in 2010.

Now: So far in 2019, house prices are up 5% to $605,680 while rents are up 4.2%.

The decade: California house prices rose 120% vs. 26% in the 2000s. Rents are up an average 3.5% in the 2010s vs. 4.6% in the previous 10 years.

The redemption

A decade ago, California’s housing crisis was about people who could not afford the home they owned.

Ultra-aggressive lending put too many homeowners into mortgage payments they couldn’t make for homes that proved to be badly overvalued. Developers took in equally easy-to-get money and overbuilt residential and commercial properties.

When it all began to unravel in the middle of the 2000s, the fallout was widespread. Not only did real estate suffer, but the pain dispersed into any business that took in property-related cash. So as 1-in-13 California jobs disappeared between 2008 through 2010, the state had few buyers in a market flooded with desperate sellers.

Home values plummeted by more than half in 2008-09 and made a mess of 2009 selling conditions. Some 71% of home sales statewide were either foreclosure-related or a “short sale,” in which case a lender agreed to accept less than what was owed on the collateral, according to Attom Data Solutions.

Trust me, 10 years ago few would predict today’s far healthier conditions. Distressed sales represent just 7% of statewide sales, leaving many to complain there are no housing bargains to be found.

Let me use a simplistic measurement of California’s “premium” house pricing — the ratio of California’s median to a comparable U.S. midpoint — to convey the pricing crunch.

Over the past 50 years, California houses sold on average for 70% more than a typical U.S. residence. And the last time California shoppers could buy at below-average valuations was … you guessed it … 2009. So you see what economic devastation can do for “affordability.”

Fast-forward to the end of this decade and a California house hunter will pay 2.2 times what a typical American home costs. The Golden State’s home prices have rebounded at twice the U.S. upswing: up 120% since 2009 vs. 60% nationwide.

And renters, by my three-metro California index, are hard hit, too: paying 41% more over the past five years. That’s well above the 27% average for half-decade periods in the past 50 years and the biggest jump since 2005.

The “whys” behind these growing price gaps are by no means simple.

One cause seems to be forgotten: The real estate collapse into the Great Recession wiped out many builders.

In the five years ended 2012, residential construction ran at one-third the historical pace due to a dearth of lenders and real estate investors willing to fund development. Even with homebuilding’s return to 70% of its historical California pace in the past five years, the decade’s construction shortfall is eye-catching.

California has built just 8% of the nation’s new residential units in the 2010s. That’s well below the state’s 11.5% slice of U.S. residential construction seen during the previous four decades.

And clearly, residential construction failed to keep pace with California employers’ thirst for workers. In the dark days of 2009, I can all but guarantee that nobody predicted the state’s"

The Subaru Outback is not emotive, but it offers an impregnable alternative to the small SUVs on the market. Select the base flathead engine with the premium trim line and this model stays just under the $30,000 price threshold.

Subaru’s successes in recent years are well noted, what has transformed this niche car manufacturer into a mainstream brand. Certainly, Subaru isn’t inclined to take the battle to GM or Toyota for market supremacy, but it is outselling the world’s new number one automaker, Volkswagen, in the toughest and most profitable consumer market in the world. And it is doing so by building the kinds of models people want: all-wheel drive utility vehicles and cars.

The Subaru Outback straddles the SUV/wagon divide, by delivering what essentially is a tall wagon. Where the Chrysler Pacifica and now the Toyota Venza failed to gain the kind of traction in the segment needed to make a go of it, the Subaru Outback has mastered it. Indeed, the Outback may be the poster vehicle for everything that Subaru is doing right.

2015 Subaru Outback

A 2015 Subaru Outback was a recent weekly visitor and a reminder to me of an Outback model I had some 18 months earlier. That earlier model was powered by a 3.6-liter inline-six engine; the latest sampler had the smaller 2.5-liter inline-four. Both engines are horizontally opposed or “BOXER” motors with aluminum cylinder blocks and heads. Subaru is sticking with the technology because it works and this company knows that messing with success is simply ludicrous.

Both engines come paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Moreover, each one can be operated in manual mode with six “steps” mimicking gears. The clicks of the stick or by accessing the paddle shifters provides the manual simulation some drivers desire. Personally, it isn’t my favorite way to get around, but it may work for you.

The engine on hand delivers 175 horsepower and 174 foot-pounds of torque. Those numbers seem relatively low, even with multi-port fuel injection and electronic throttle control at the ready. Crazily, we are seeing a performance war going on where manufacturers are squeezing additional power out of smaller numbers while still attempting to attain the ever increasing EPA corporate average fleet economy or CAFE numbers. Subaru isn’t participating in the insanity, although I am certain that some people would prefer that"

After simulated ischaemia for 48 hrs, coculture with EnSCs resulted in ∼50% fewer TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes relative to culture alone ([Fig. 4](#fig04){ref-type=""fig""}A and B). To evaluate a possible paracrine effect of EnSCs on cardiomyocyte proliferation, the coculture period was extended for an additional 8 days. Proliferating cardiomyocytes were detected by double immunostaining of Ki67 and TnT ([Fig. 4](#fig04){ref-type=""fig""}C). Coculture increased the dual Ki67/TnT-positive cells by about threefold relative to the control group ([Fig. 4](#fig04){ref-type=""fig""}D). Conditioned medium from EnSC cultures also enhanced tube formation of HUVECs ([Fig. 4](#fig04){ref-type=""fig""}E). HUVEC tube length was significantly increased in the presence of conditioned medium at all time-points ([Fig. 4](#fig04){ref-type=""fig""}F). These results confirmed that cytokines released from EnSCs are cardioprotective, possibly mitogenic and pro-angiogenic, and may stimulate cardiac myocyte re-entry into the cell cycle.

Norbert Sandor Balogh (born 21 February 1996) is a Hungarian footballer who plays as a forward for Hull City. He was also part of the Hungarian U-19 at the 2014 UEFA European Under-19 Championship.

Career
Balogh grew up in very poor circumstances in Hajdúböszörmény, Hajdú County, Hungary. His parents did not earn enough money, therefore he often starved. Balogh's parents could not afford to buy new shoes for him, therefore he was often mocked at school. In an interview with Nemzeti Sport, Balogh said that he did not mind that he was brought up in poor circumstances because as an adult he can appreciate the success more. But he never forgets where he comes from. He is still in touch with his old friends from his birthplace. He remembers during the summers he played football with his friends even if they did not have food.

414,15,17184,"Pingualuit Crater Lake, Québec. Pingualuit ᐱᖑᐊᓗᐃᑦ​ is an Inuit word meaning pimple. Ironically, Pingualuit Crater Lake is said to have the purest freshwater on earth. The crater surrounding the lake was formed by a meteorite over 1.4 million years ago in the Pleistocene Epoch. The meteorite evaporated on impact in an explosion which melted thousands of tons of stone and wiped away all life for hundreds of kilometres around the crater. Local Inuit people consider this unusually calm place to be a site of extreme power, where one comes to revitalize oneself. In order to protect this unique impact crater, Pingualuit National Park was established in 2004. Photo Credit: NASA

The Pingualuit Impact Crater (AKA – New Quebec Crater, AKA – Chubb Crater) is the small dot in the upper right centre of this image. Lake Couture (another impact structure) is visible as the open water to the lower left centre.Pingualuit Impact Crater is filled by an almost perfectly circular 3 km diameter lake which contrasts sharply with the irregular lakes of the area. It is larger than the smallest crater on the moon that is visible by telescope from earth.

In August of 2001, I fulfilled the dream I vowed in the 1950’s to complete after I watched Dr. Meen describe his exploration of the Pingualuit (AKA Chubb) crater on TV. Here I am, actually flying GOZooM over the crater!! The energy released on forming Pingualuit was on the order of 1018 Joules. This is equivalent to the energy in 250 megatons of TNT, greater than the energy in the largest nuclear device (Grieve).

In Northern Quebec, Canada, there is a pristine simple crater that in 1999 was renamed the Pingualuit Meteorite Crater. The crater is larger than the smallest crater on the moon that is visible by telescope from earth. The crater is 3.44 km in diameter with a depth of 400 metres. The lake which occupies the crater is 267 metres deep and it is Quebec’s deepest lake. The crater rim is over 100 metres above the surface of the enclosed lake with a pitch of 40 to 45 degrees down to the water. Uplift from the original impact extends outward to a distance equal to almost twice the diameter of the crater.

The regolith on the crater wall made it extremely difficult and dangerous to climb on.Yours truly standing on the rim of the Pingualuit Impact Crater, a lifelong dream fulfilled!!Regolith covered rim of the Pingualuit CraterThis is the earliest known aerial photograph of Chubb Crater, taken by the U.

Ben Meen, The National Geographic Society–Royal Ontario Museum Expedition to Chubb Crater, Ungava, Quebec, 1951, p. 2).

Abstract :
Aerial photographs of Chubb Crater, a striking 3.4 km-wide circular basin in the far north of Quebec, led the Ontario prospector Fred W. Chubb to think it might be an extinct volcano, and possibly the site of a diamond-bearing diatreme. V. Ben Meen, the Director of the Royal Ontario Museum of Geology and Mineralogy in Toronto, however, suspected it was an impact crater caused by a meteorite. Meen led two expeditions to the crater in 1950 and 1951. Despite early opposition and the initial absence of corroborative field evidence, he held on to a persistent belief in the crater’s meteoritic origin. Later fieldwork ultimately provided strong evidence in support of this view. The discovery of the crater led to the development of a program at the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa to search for additional impact craters on the Canadian Shield, and the development of valuable criteria by which they could be authenticated. The craters discovered through the program fit well on the Baldwin curve relating crater depth to"

Been laid low by cold or flu?

If your cold hasn't already befuddled your head, being confronted by a gazillion different remedies on the pharmacy shelves could just take you over the line.

More than $250 million worth of cold, cough and flu remedies are sold in Australia every year. For many products there's not much convincing evidence that they work – but nor is there much evidence they don't work.

Confused?

We sift through the options and guide you on what – if anything – is worth buying for different symptoms. The better news is that you might be able to skip the pharmacy spree with some simple home remedies.

Know your enemy!

The ingredients in cough, cold and flu treatments target one or more particular symptom, so match your symptoms to the treatments. Many products are combos treating more than one symptom, so try to buy only those that address the symptoms you actually have.

Loose, chesty cough?

Consider expectorants and mucolytics

""Chesty cough"" liquids contain expectorants and/or mucolytics. Expectorants, including guaiphenesin, ammonia and senega, help make coughing out secretions easier, while bromhexine, a mucolytic, thins mucus in the lungs.

Dry cough?

Consider suppressants

""Dry cough"" liquids, as well as many combination cold and flu tablets, contain suppressants such as codeine, pholcodine and dextromethorphan. However, the effect is little better – if at all – than a placebo. Use them only for painful, dry and persistent coughs – using suppressants for chesty coughs could delay recovery.

Blocked nose?

Consider decongestants

Decongestants reduce the ""stuffed up"" feeling and mucus formation. They're not always effective, so you may or may not experience any noticeable difference.

Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant, but it's kept behind the counter because it can be used to make methamphetamine. If you want to purchase it, you will have to ask the pharmacist for it and show ID.

Phenylephrine (look for PE on product labels – e.g. Sudafed PE) has been marketed as a substitute for pseudoephedrine, but is not as effective.

Spray (topical) decongestants, including oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, are faster-acting than oral decongestants and have fewer side effects. They should be used sparingly – continued use can make congestion worse.

Runny nose?

Consider anticholinergic spray

Atrovent nasal spray contains ipratropium bromide (which is an anticholinergic), which can help dry up a runny nose and is also recommended for allergies.

There's not much evidence oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, brompheniramine, doxylamine and chlorpheniramine help dry up a runny nose caused by colds, but they may make sleeping easier by countering the stimulating effects of decongestants.

Side effects include dry eyes and mouth and daytime drowsiness – these effects are usually, but not always, found in night-time products, so check the label. People with narrow-angle glaucoma or an enlarged"

RNA expression levels in patients from the TCGA dataset was obtained by RNA-Seq and the expression levels were presented as RPKM (millions of readings per kilogram of mapping) and then transformed by log2 (FPKM +1). The DNA methylation status of patients from the TCGA dataset was determined by human methylation of the 450k chip and the expression levels were presented as between 0 to 1 using the ACTL10 related probe; 0 indicated no methylation and 1 indicated 100% methylation.

The P-value and hazard ratio (HR) of the whole genome gene expression profile and the whole genome DNA methylation profile was calculated using the prognosis of CN-AML from the TCGA dataset and the HR function in the survcomp package. The ACTL10 gene met the criterion of P\<0.05 for both RNA expression and DNA methylation. Subsequently, ACTL10 RNA expression levels were divided into a high expression group and a low expression group (ACTL10 RNA-high expression group and ACTL10 RNA-low expression group) through the maximally selected rank statistics method from the surv_cutpoint package of survminer. The methylation status of ACTL10 DNA was also divided into a methylated high group and a methylated low group (ACTL10 DNA methylation-high group and ACTL10 DNA methylation-low group) using the maximally selected rank statistics method from the surv_cutpoint package of survminer.

Systemd Socket Activation Trigger a bash script

I would like to periodically trigger a remote bash script.  How this needs to work is that a 3rd party application will connect to a CentOS 7 system on a specific TCP port and send a short text message.   SSH is not an option because of the 3rd party application.
When the message is received it needs to pass the IP address to the bash script.  I would like the bash script to run and then go dormant until the next message.  I would prefer not to write a daemon.  I just want to keep this simple.

SHE lay, the gilded lily with geranium lips, in the midst of the flower of
night. Kindlier than the moon, her body glowed with more than harvest gold. Fierier than
the portent of a double Venus, her green eyes shot forth utmost flames. From the golden
chalice of love arose a perfume terrible and beautiful, a perfume strong and deadly to
overcome the subtler fragrance of her whole being with its dominant, unshamed appeal.

She lay with arms outstretched, as if awaiting the visitation of some god.

Some ghastly god, for sure? For where she lay, the gilded lily with geranium lips, was,
as it were, a flower of night.

It was a small square room, black from edge to edge. A dull dead black that gave back
no light from the two solemn candlesticks of silver, crowned with long guttering tapers,
which gave the only relief in all that world of night.

These stood at the head of her strange couch. It was a huge coffin, lidless, with
hinged sides, whereon she lay. She had losened the girths and lowered the sides, to
stretch herself at ease. Six black ropes of silk hung from the ceiling with their hooks,
which could be attached to rings on the {187} sides of the coffin, so that at will it
might be made to swing slowly to and fro.

A heavy rug of black cats' skin was spread under her, as if her body, gleaming now like
moonstone, now like amber, would coax electric sparks from the fur.

Wonderful was the body of the woman; she changed ever as she lay. She outran the gamut
of all music and flowers and jewels and soft words; there is nothing beautiful upon the
earth that she did not resemble. At the sides of the room stood tall pier-glasses in black
frames, cunningly disposed so that from the centre one could see endless avenues of her
beauty, reaching out into infinity.

Even the roof was mirror-clad, so that as she lay upon the furs she might look upward,
and see herself hanging like a star from the black vault of night.

Besides her in the temple was but one strange image. Carved of that polished black
granite of Egypt, which seems, as it were, the very bodily form of the Night of Time,
there squatted a god upon his pedestal; an inscrutable god, smiling, ever smiling with a
smile that spoke unfathomable lust and cruelty resolved --- by what theurgic alchemy? ---
into a pure and passionless bliss. It was a thing eternal as the stars --- nay, before it
the very stars might bow as in the reverence of Youth to age! Yet in it stood a strength
and beauty as of golden youth.

Its skin was polished and shining, not as if reflecting the guarded light of the
electric globes, but as if the very soul of light --- a light too essential to be
recognized as light by men --- did inhabit and inform it.

As she lay, the gilded lily, she moved the passionate lips {188} in some mysterious
orison that was subtler and stronger than prayer.

""Have not I wooed Thee and awaited Thee? But Thou comest not. By what spell may I
conjure Thee? Am I the mock of Thy majesty? Ah, my god, my master, my lover --- nay, that
Thou art not.

""But I love Thee! I worship Thee!""

With supreme force she cried out upon the God; she tore at her beautiful flesh with her
fingers; she writhed upon the fur; words of dreadful passion bubbled at her lips; her
mouth was like a raging sea of blasphemy; she moaned and struggled, torn by some internal
force even as a woman in childbirth; she sank back into black silence, exhausted, numb.

But now the words came back like echoes from the infinite --- I love thee! I worship
thee!

The lights went out; the black god gathered himself together; his mighty form outran
the limits of space. He gathered himself in force and fire; he concentrated himself; as a
black cloud he wrapped her round -- body and soul. He ate her up with his first kiss; his
arms crushed her into his mouth as a boy might crush some golden grape; the majesty of his
passion clove her with white-hot steel; her life rushed headlong down the steeps"

Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein generally relate to seismic acquisition systems, devices and methods, and more specifically to management and testing of such systems.
Discussion of the Background
Seismic waves generated artificially for the imaging of geological layers have been used for many years. Reflection seismology is a method of geophysical exploration used to determine the properties of a portion of a subsurface layer in the earth, which information is especially helpful in the oil and gas industry. Seismic waves (i.e., sound or other pressure waves) are sent into the earth, directed toward the subsurface area. Seismic data are collected regarding the time it takes for the reflections of the generated seismic waves to come back to one or more receivers. Reflections are generally representative of interfaces between the layers of the subsurface. The seismic data can therefore be analyzed to generate a profile (image) of the geophysical structure, i.e., the layers of the investigated subsurface. This type of seismic acquisition or exploration can be used both on the subsurface of land areas and for exploring the subsurface of the ocean floor. For example, marine techniques send energy waves into the earth by first generating the energy waves in or on the ocean.
One way to perform marine seismic acquisitions or surveys is to tow an array of seismic receivers, which may be disposed on elongated streamers, by a vessel over the geographical area of interest (GAI) and to generate source signals with one or more sources (towed by said vessel or a dedicated vessel which tows only the sources), and receive corresponding reflections while traversing the GAI. This process is sometimes referred to as “shooting” a GAI or cell being surveyed.
As marine seismic surveying has increased in sophistication, it has become possible to tow more sources and receivers behind a single vessel. Streamers can now be up to 18 km long, towed at approximately 5 knots, 10 m below the ocean surface. In addition to sources or receivers, streamers can include “birds” with control surfaces used to position the streamer vertically or horizontally. Streamers can also include other components such as in-sea modules that process seismic data, recover modules, mammals detection modules, ranging modules, etc.
Given the length of streamers, they are generally stored spooled on winches on the back of the vessel when not in use. For example, a storage winch can hold up to 18 km of a streamer having a diameter up to 60 mm. Furthermore, components of streamers are often detachable from each other. This permits reconfiguring a streamer to include the number of positioning elements (e.g., birds), receivers, noise cancelling sections or other elements required to shoot a particular GAI. In this respect, note that a streamer may include tens if not hundreds of components that can be arranged in many different ways to form the streamer. Therefore, once a streamer is placed on a spool, it is very difficult to identify each component of the streamer and decide whether the streamer has the correct configuration for a next seismic survey. Even more, after a seismic survey is finalized and the vessel is deployed for another seismic survey requiring a different streamer configuration, it is logistically difficult for the vessel's operator to determine each component of the streamer for reconfiguring the streamer.
It is therefore desirable to be able to locate a particular element on a streamer to be removed or replaced while configuring streamers for a GAI, or for maintenance. It is also desirable for operators of seismic measurement systems to be able to audit their equipment inventory, e.g., their stock of streamer components. It is further desirable to be"

When I mouse over one of the elements of that group(an invisible circle) I want one of the other elements (the red circle on that specific node only which I gave an id of ""backcircle"") to do something. Currently this is what I have, but it does it to all nodes not just the one I'm hovering over's element.
this.node = this.d3Graph.selectAll(null)
.data(this.props.nodes)
.enter()
.append(""g"")
.attr(""class"", ""nodes"");

this.node.append(""circle"")
.attr(""id"", ""backCircle"")

Computing the equation of state of cold matter we determine neutron and hybrid star masses and radii. In an extension of the investigation we consider the cooling behavior of the compact stars and derive a general relation between the star’s mass and rotation and its cooling behavior. Finally we study the effect of $\Delta$ resonances for star matter, especially with respect to possible solutions of stars with small radii.'

title: 'Nuclear matter, nuclei, and neutron stars in hadron and quark-hadron models'
---

Introduction
============

A central topic in modern nuclear physics is the study of the general behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. One expects a transition from the effective degrees of freedom in vacuum and ground state matter, hadrons, to a phase of quarks and gluons at high temperatures and/or densities. This can be described by the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement transition. The actual structure of the transition is still unknown, perhaps with the exception in the case of vanishing chemical potential, where lattice results show a cross-over transition. Some lattice results also point to a critical end-point of a first-order transition line in temperature and chemical potential [@fodor]. In order to describe the matter, a main challenge for theory is to develop models that can cover all the ranges of temperatures and densities. This requires a model that is able to reproduce both nuclear matter ground state properties and the quark and gluon phase beyond the phase transition. In the following we develop an effective theoretical description along these lines. Results for neutron star properties and their cooling behavior within this approach will be presented. In addition we study the influence of the $\Delta$ baryons on stellar properties.

Effective Chiral Model
======================

In order to describe hadronic physics as well as quark degrees of freedom we couple an effective chiral flavor-SU(3) model for hadrons [@chiral1] with a modified version of the so-called PNJL quark model. The model includes the lowest SU(3) multiplets of hadrons and quarks. Baryonic and constitutent quark vacuum masses are generated via spontaneous symmetry breaking by the coupling of the particles to the scalar fields, which attain non-zero vacuum expectation values. Explicitly the Lagrangian reads [@eu]: $$\begin{aligned}
&L = L_{Kin}+L_{Int}+L_{Self}+L_{SB}-U,&\end{aligned}$$ Here, the interaction term between baryons, quarks and mesons is given by $$L_{Int}=-\sum_i \bar{\psi_i}[\gamma_0(g_{i\omega}\omega+g_{i\phi}\phi+g_{i\rho}\tau_3\rho)+M_i^*]\psi_i,\nonumber$$ with the effective baryon and quark mass $M_i^*$ $$M_{i}^*=g_{i\sigma}\sigma+g_{i\delta}\tau_3\delta+g_{"

abstract: 'Despite their success for object detection, convolutional neural networks are ill-equipped for incremental learning, i.e., adapting the original model trained on a set of classes to additionally detect objects of new classes, in the absence of the initial training data. They suffer from “catastrophic forgetting”—an abrupt degradation of performance on the original set of classes, when the training objective is adapted to the new classes. We present a method to address this issue, and learn object detectors incrementally, when neither the original training data nor annotations for the original classes in the new training set are available. The core of our proposed solution is a loss function to balance the interplay between predictions on the new classes and a new distillation loss which minimizes the discrepancy between responses for old classes from the original and the updated networks. This incremental learning can be performed multiple times, for a new set of classes in each step, with a moderate drop in performance compared to the baseline network trained on the ensemble of data. We present object detection results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and COCO datasets, along with a detailed empirical analysis of the approach.'

==========

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous common alleles that affect cancer susceptibility \[[@CR1]--[@CR4]\], yet the combined effects of the alleles currently discovered are too small to explain the bulk of heritable disease risk. This suggests, that the genetic influence on cancer susceptibility might not be entirely due the combined additive effects of individual alleles. Experimental mouse models of cancer are ideal for examining the effects of genetic modifiers that act epistatically with known susceptibility loci. Epistasis is difficult to detect in human GWAS due to the very large sample size required. However, it is straightforward to engineer mutant mice in which a known susceptibility locus is altered to change the risk of disease. By crossing the mutant onto a population of mice with different genetic backgrounds of naturally occurring variation, it is theoretically possible to map modifier loci.

The great majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) develop from adenomas \[[@CR5], [@CR6]\]. *Apc* mutations are found in the germ line of patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and in over 80 % of sporadic colorectal adenomas \[[@CR7]--[@CR11]\]. *Apc* is a tumor suppressor gene \[[@CR7]\], that encodes a large protein \[[@CR8]\] that regulates Wnt pathway activity through its interaction with the transcription factor β-catenin \[[@CR12]--[@CR17]\]. *Apc* also interacts with numerous actin and microtubule-associated proteins \[[@CR17]--[@CR19]\]. Roles for *Apc* in cell migration have been demonstrated *in vitro* and in mouse models \[[@CR13], [@CR20]\].

Several mouse models with heterozygous germline mutations of *Apc* exist, and all of these develop adenomatous intestinal polyps \[[@CR21], [@CR22]\]. Different mutations are associated with different disease severities. For example, *Apc*^*R850X/+*^ (*Min*) mice typically develop \~100 intestinal polyps at 3--4 months of age, whereas the *Apc*^*1322T/+*^ mice develop polyps earlier in life, and the *Apc*^*1638N/+*^ model produces only a handful of polyps at over a"

Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s Palestinian predicament is truly vexing. The
stakes are so high, and the confidence in the outcome is so low it is no
surprise Netanyahu’s response in the past three years has been to do virtually
nothing.

Netanyahu’s decision to maintain the status quo, beyond reasons
of substance, was reinforced by his own ideological predisposition, a
fundamental mistrust of Palestinian intentions and political expedience. Serious
advances toward a final-status arrangement with the Palestinians would only have
produced not only significant security risks for Israel, but would also have
alienated the Likud base and its so-called “natural” partners, placing his
coalition in jeopardy.

Inaction, however, is unlikely to continue to be
viable policy for the new Netanyahu government, no matter what its
composition.

Surely, few would dispute that international pressure has
been mounting for Israel to end the occupation and to allow for the emergence of
an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank. The UN General Assembly vote
last November to upgrade the PA to observer-state status, which was secured with
the active and passive support of many key Israeli allies, was broadly perceived
as a signal of those"

Cancer specimens and thyroid cancer patients {#Sec3}
--------------------------------------------

The first studied cases were multiple cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) with 10 common types of cancer (breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix) in quadruplicates of each with matched normal tissue and duplicated cores per case (except single cores for the prostate cases). These tissue microarrays were purchased from US Biomax Inc. (MC802 from US Biomax Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).

Also, we studied 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid nodules of different histologic types; thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed in 193 patients: 168 were papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 25 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC). The most frequent histotype among papillary carcinomas was the classic variant (CPTC) (107 cases), followed by the follicular variant (FVPTC) (48 cases) and the tall-cell (TCPTC) variant was identified in 13 cases. We also obtained benign tissue from patients, including 31 follicular adenomas (FA) and 42 goiters (G), and 15 normal thyroid tissues obtained from the contralateral lobe of FA (Normal Tissue). The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system was used to detect aggressiveness at diagnosis for differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Patients were managed according to Latin American Thyroid Society (LATS) and Ameican Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines and followed for a period of 12 to 175 months (median = 35; mean = 41.1; SD \[standard deviation\] = 26 months). All the clinical, surgical, and pathological reports, also as follow-up data, were recorded.

For diagnostic confirmation, two experienced pathologists (JV and FAS) reviewed carefully and independently all tumours. Cases presenting conflicting results or areas of poor differentiation were excluded. Paraffin blocks of formalin-fixed tissues were collected and, in each case, the most representative area of the tumour, normal surrounding tissue, tumour areas of invasiveness, and metastatic tissue were selected and micro-dissected, whenever available. The Research Ethics Committees of the AC Camargo Cancer Center, São Paulo, Brazil (1259/09-C), approved this study protocol.

Immunohistochemical detection {#Sec4}
-----------------------------

Commercial TMA slides of multiple cancer types were purchased from US Biomax Inc. (Rockville, Maryland, USA). Thyroid TMA was constructed (in triplicates) using the semi-automated TMArrayer (Beecher Instruments®, Silver Springs, MD, USA). The thyroid tissue samples investigated, were obtained and maintained in the tissue bank of the A. C. Camargo Hospital.

Immunohistochemistry was performed manually, as follows: Five μm TMA sections were placed on electrically charged slides, de-paraffinised, and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of alcohol. The endogenous peroxide activity was quenched for 15 min. With H~2~O~2~ and the tissue sections were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval in a steamer (90 °C for 30 min), using 10% citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0). Tissues sections were then incubated overnight at 6 °C, with appropriate antibodies. The specification of the antibodies used, the code/clone, the company, the titration, and the antigen retrieval procedure are presented in Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}. The advanced biotin-free polymer detection system (DAKO, Carpenteria, CA, USA) was used. The chromogen DAB (3.3-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride; Sigma, St Louis, MA, USA) was applied at room temperature for 5 min. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Positive and negative"

Exiled Tibetans gather in India to discuss new way

It's been almost 50 years since the Tibetan god-king fled across the Himalayas and created his government-in-exile in this hill town. Decades later, the Dalai Lama and his followers are still in Dharmsala.

And the struggle for Tibet? That, they increasingly say here, has been futile.

""We have failed to bring any positive change inside Tibet,"" said Samdhong Rinpoche, prime minister of the government-in-exile. ""The majority of Tibetans are increasingly frustrated and want more forceful change.""

Now, nearly everything is on the table for discussion. Starting Monday, exiled Tibetans from around the world will gather in Dharmsala, called together by the Dalai Lama for a six-day meeting that could end years of carefully moderated policies toward Beijing.

In a town of often-feuding exiles, many now have at least one thing to agree upon: Their movement has reached a crossroad. The Dalai Lama is growing old, a young generation of activists want tough talk toward China and Beijing is moving thousands of ethnic Han Chinese into Tibet.

""In ten or 15 years, when we look back at this, we're hopeful that we'll see this as a historic conference,"" said Tsewang Rigzin, president of the Tibetan Youth Congress, one of the more militant activist groups. ""We know that we have to be rational and reasonable"

It seems like the majority of anime today has come down to how best to mix up the standard romance comedy by adding some theme to the same exact type of characters. Fitting into this style perfectly we have anti social protagonist meets school beauty via being forced into club interaction.

The Shin Megami Tensei games have always been a great demon fighting RPG series, and with how Persona 4 did as an anime, I do think that this will work out decently. I personally haven’t tried out Devil Survivor 2, but I did play the first one. Although the story in the first game wasn’t really anything you would proudly tell anyone about, it was still a fun overall experience. As I have said earlier, I do think that this anime has a chance of turning out decently, but I wouldn’t place any higher hopes beyond that. So don’t expect a 9/10 anime, because you’ll be disappointed :3

This series always felt a little off to me so I was never all that interested. Maybe had they put some extra effort into sculpting the setting to be less chuuni maybe there would be something worth it here.

442,23,5690,"What is the best VR headset that you can buy?

2019 is set to be a great year in the world of virtual reality, with VR headsets from the likes of Oculus, HTC and Sony finally achieving mainstream success and recognition. Even the prices have begun to drop, making VR accessible to more people than ever before.

The flip side is that there are now more VR headsets on the market than ever before, making it hard to choose one to buy. Don’t fret; we at Tech Advisor have used all of the popular VR headsets, and here’s where we tell you what to look out for when buying a headset, along with our recommendation of the best VR headsets on the market right now.

VR headset buying advice

So, what kind of things should you consider if you’re on the market for a VR headset?

Mobile, PC or standalone?

The biggest factor to consider when on the market for a VR headset is how you’re planning on powering it. There are three types of VR headset on the market at the moment; smartphone-powered, PC-powered or standalone, with the latter being a relatively new option for prospective VR users.

Mobile VR headsets are shaped like a VR headset, but they require a smartphone for the display, internals, tracking and everything else needed to provide a mobile VR experience. This is generally thought of as a beginner’s VR headset; it gives you access to a budget range of experiences, 360-degree videos and basic games, but doesn’t provide much in the way of actual interaction with virtual environments.

The next step up is to opt for the Gear VR or Google Daydream; these mobile VR headsets only work with certain smartphones, and aim to deliver a higher quality experience than those provided by generic mobile viewers. Both platforms have dedicated app stores full of VR experiences and games, and both come with controllers that allow you to interact with the games and apps you download.

If mobile VR isn’t your cup of tea, the second option available to you are standalone VR headsets. These started appearing in 2018, with the Oculus Go being the most popular option on the market at the moment. These are, as the name suggests, standalone VR headsets that don’t require a smartphone or PC for use.

The experience is similar to premium mobile VR headsets like Gear VR and Google Daydream, and come with a dedicated controller for VR interaction. These are slightly more expensive than mobile VR headsets but with upgraded visuals and simplicity of use compared to cheaper options, it’s the ideal for many consumers.

Finally, you have the option to buy a PC-powered VR headset. These headsets are the most capable on the market, providing high-end games and VR experiences with incredibly accurate location-based tracking and advanced controllers for full immersion. The catch? The headsets are also the most expensive available at around £400+, and require a £500+ PC to be able to power the experiences.

Controllers

Though it may not sound like it, controllers are a very important area when it comes to picking a VR headset. That’s because the controllers vary depending on the system, with some offering true 1:1 positional tracking while others don’t. Controllers are your gateway into the virtual world, allowing you to reach out and interact with the environment, so you want them to be as accurate and comfortable as possible.

Generally speaking, the high-end VR headsets like the Vive and Rift offer great controllers with true"

No. 04-12353. Non-Argument Calendar.
United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.
January 27, 2005.

J. Hue Henry, J. Hue Henry, P.C., Athens, GA, for Plaintiff-Appellant.
James C. Whelchel, Whelchel, Carlton & Waller, LLP, Moultrie, GA, for Defendant-Appellee.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.
Before BLACK, BARKETT and GODBOLD, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:


1
Jerry Jackson Lee, a medical doctor, enjoyed staff privileges at a hospital operated by the Hospital Authority of Colquitt County, Georgia. The hospital required its staff to renew hospital privileges every two years. Dr. Lee's renewal application led to an investigation into his professional competency. He sued seeking injunctive relief and damages, alleging that the hospital failed to follow its bylaws concerning the renewal of his staff privileges. The district court granted summary judgment for the hospital. We affirm.


2
The hospital's medical staff reappointment application required that applicants disclose any prior suspensions of privileges or disciplinary action at any hospital. The form asked: ""Have your privileges at any hospital ever been suspended, diminished, revoked, or not reviewed."" Another question asked: ""Have you ever been denied appointment, clinical privileges, renewal thereof or been subject to disciplinary action by any hospital or medical organization."" Dr. Lee answered both of these questions in the negative.


3
Dr. D.W. Adcock, a retired physician employed as the hospital's Medical Director, initially reviewed Dr. Lee's application. Dr. Lee's negative answers to the two questions quoted above raised Dr. Adcock's suspicions. He was aware of an incident that had occurred at another hospital in Worth County, relating to Dr. Lee's performing a hysterectomy on a woman who was pregnant at the time. He recalled that the incident was well known in the Worth County community and that it had been reported in a newspaper. He also recalled that Dr. Lee had received some form of discipline for this incident. He wrote Dr. Patel, the chief-of-staff of the Baptist Hospital Worth County seeking information on Lee's staff privileges at that hospital. Also he requested that Dr. Lee meet with him ""to discuss a staff matter."" At that meeting Dr. Lee confirmed that he had performed a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman and that he had been suspended for a period of several days. He explained that the medical staff at the other hospital had told him the incident was a ""non-event"" and that he need not mention the matter in his application for reappointment at the Colquitt County hospital. In another letter to Dr. Adcock, Dr. Lee stated that he had been placed on a temporary suspension during the investigation of the incident at the Worth County hospital, but stated that the suspension had been ""rescinded.""


4
By a subsequent letter to Dr. Adcock, Dr. Patel described the Worth County hospital's response to the incident involving the hysterectomy as follows:


5
In May of 1999, Dr. Lee's clinical privileges were summarily suspended based on his care and treatment of a patient at Baptist Hospital Worth County. His suspension was lifted after a three-week period with the understanding that peer review activities, as well as a quality assurance review, were ongoing.


6
In July of 1999, Dr. Lee was placed on probation for a period of twelve months with mandatory consultation and proctoring of his GYN surgical cases. During this time, I was responsible for consulting with Dr. Lee and approving all his GYN surgical cases prior to surgery. I also conducted a prospective review of all of his surgical cases during this year.


7
Dr. Lee's probationary period ended in July of 2000 with the expectation that he will continue to institute and follow practices and procedures standard within his specialty and in line with his delineation of privileges.

446,11,22753,"CM Swap Yet Again in Uttarakhand

With hardly six months left for the Uttarakhand Assembly elections, the ruling BJP has replaced the State’s Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ with BC Khanduri.

When the BJP came to power in 2007, Khanduri was made CM. When BJP lost all five seats of the State to the Congress in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Khanduri was removed, but replaced by Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’.
In Nishank’s rule, forgeries and scams became commonplace. The CAG Report exposed how Rs.200 crore was swindled in the Haridwar Mahakumbh in 2010. There were also allegations of scandals in allotment of 56 power projects. BJP’s own District Panchayat President from Tehri, Ratan Singh Gunsola, accused that he was asked to pay Rs.2 crore as a bribe for allotment of a power project! As the heat over these scandals increased, all the 56 allotments were cancelled. The Nishank Govt was also embarrassed by the exposure of the fraud involved in transfer of Citurgia Biochemicals’ land to Sturdia Developers, a matter which came to the courts. Hundreds of crores, received from the Centre for disaster relief, were siphoned off to fill ministers’ personal coffers. The death of Swami Nityananda brought the question of illegal sand mining and criminal mining mafia to the fore.

But now, the RSS and BJP, eager to ride the anti-corruption wave against the Congress, are eager to first jettison any embarrassing baggage and at least put up an appearance of being ‘clean’. First, Yeddyurappa’s head rolled in Karnataka. And now Nishank was the next to go.

448,24,4731,"I have had several friends bug me about this on-and-off for a while now, so I decided to write up the experience using non-rustup methods of installing Rust. The following is what I discovered after looking around the Rust Forge and main website, as well as going through the contents of the tarballs and comparing to the contents of the ~/.rustup directory.

The state of non-rustup installation methods

The download page

The Rust installation tarballs seem a bit neglected. The download page (https://forge.rust-lang.org/other-installation-methods.html) only lists tarballs for the latest versions, and only for full distributions (not components or targets). The link to past releases 404’s (https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/index.html), and there is no visible way to download the targets that don’t have rustc/cargo (looking at x86_64-unknown-linux-musl in particular), and no way to browse for them because of the aforementioned 404.

The tarballs themselves

The tarballs are in a layout that requires the use of an./install.sh script to place them in a configurable prefix (default /usr/local ). It goes beyond just copying files into place, however, and there are a few stateful bits. The installer writes manifest files with absolute paths, which seem to only be used for the uninstall script. On linux it will also try to create an ld.conf.d file (but only if you installed to the standard prefix?) and then run ldconfig (regardless of where you installed), which will fail unless you’re running with sudo. This part seems extra weird to me as the rustup version seems to live with user-only installs just fine and doesn’t have to mess with ldconfig.

Why should we care?

Rustup is handy, right? I think rustup is a great and useful tool as a Rust developer. There are cases where we should have a better story around installing one particular Rust version and leaving it at that. Build and CI springs immediately to mind; if you care about reproducibility you want to also make sure you’re using an exact version of a toolchain in addition to an exact version of a codebase. I believe it’s also an extra inhibition to people finding a Rust project, getting interested, and trying to compile from source.

I’ve also talked to several people who balk at the standard curlbash installation method for rustup and are also then nonplussed at having to click through several steps (while being reminded that rustup is a thing you should use) to get to the tarballs. Hopefully they then don’t notice the broken links to the past versions or the inability to add targets after that.

Why can’t you just use X?

Docker

Using docker to get a specific Rust version to build with is like using a (hard-to-debug) sledgehammer to kill a fly. Besides, if we simplified per above, it would be simple to install Rust yourself inside the container if you wanted to start from your own base to build. I prefer the model of starting with something I know and adding other stuff, rather than the docker solution which would be starting with someone else’s base and then adding/removing.

Distro Packages

No guarantee they will have the version you request to build with No guarantee the version that you build with on distro version X will exist on distro version Y No guarantee the compiler versions will be the same across distros, because of vendor patchsets No guarantee the components/targets you want will be available via the system package manager Juggling package managers and package names across distros

The tarballs that exist today

It would be nice if I could glue things together in such a way that I can do the minimal amount of bash-calling and privilege-escalation before starting my build, which is the only place I’m hoping"

Although most demographic variables were not significantly different between groups ([Table 4](#t4-crt-2016-533){ref-type=""table""}), the number of patients who had more than one hepatic metastases was significantly greater in the ECA-MRI than the Gd-EOB-MRI group (p=0.029).

### 2) Diagnostic performance

The 114 patients who underwent liver surgery had 260 focal hepatic lesions. For per-lesion analysis, the AUROC between ECA-MRI (0.924; 95% CI, 0.818 to 1.000) and Gd-EOB-MRI (0.914; 95% CI, 0.825 to 1.000) was not significantly different (p=0.885). For the 99 lesions ≤ 1 cm, the AUROCs between ECA-MRI (0.895; 95% CI, 0.752 to 1.000) and Gd-EOB-MRI (0.894; 95% CI, 0.805 to 0.984) did not differ significantly (p=0.993).

### 3) Early intrahepatic recurrence

The cumulative incidence of early intrahepatic recurrence was significantly higher (p=0.031) in the ECA-MRI (28.6%) than the Gd-EOB-MRI group (11.6%). The results of univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with early intrahepatic recurrence are shown in [Table 5](#t5-crt-2016-533){ref-type=""table""}. Differentiation of the primary colorectal tumor was not included in the univariate and multivariate analyses because of inhomogeneous data distribution. The type of contrast agent (ECA vs. Gd-EOB) was the only significant variable predicting early intrahepatic recurrence on univariate analysis (subdistributional hazard ratio \[SDHR\], 0.365; 95% CI, 0.146 to 0.915) (p=0.032). Multivariate analysis also revealed that the use of Gd-EOB-MRI was a good prognostic factor (SDHR, 0.288; 95% CI, 0.110 to 0.757) (p=0.012).

Discussion
==========

The results of this study demonstrated that the overall diagnostic performance of ECA-MRI and Gd-EOB-MRI for the evaluation of focal hepatic lesions in colorectal cancer before treatment did not differ significantly. In addition, the detection rate of additional significant hepatic lesions on MRI compared with CT was similar between groups. However, the early intrahepatic recurrence rate for patients who underwent hepatic resection was significantly higher in ECA-MRI (28.6%) than in Gd-EOB-MRI (11.6%) (p=0.031).

Several meta-analyses have described the diagnostic performance of Gd-EOB-MRI for the detection of CRLM \[[@b19-crt-2016-533],[@b20-crt-2016-533]\]. Chen et al. \[[@b19-crt-2016-533]\] reported that the pooled weighted sensitivity of Gd-EOB-MRI for detecting liver metastases was 93% (95% CI, 90 to 95). In a recent meta-analysis, Gd-EOB-MRI showed an excellent per-lesion sensitivity of 91.2% (95% CI, 83.7 to 95.4) for detecting CRLM \[[@"

453,29,3412,"The present invention relates to a method of fusing an electrofusion joint having an electric resistance heating wire embedded therein, a method of confirming the state of fusion and an electrofusion joint suitable for use in such methods.
Electrofusion joints have been developed recently and are finding spreading use in various fields such as jointing of plastic pipes of water works, sewage pipes and gas pipes and in various forms such as a saddle joint, an elbow joint, a T joint and a cap joint. In general, an electrofusion joint is a molded article with an electrical resistance heating wire embedded therein. Fusion of this type of joint to a pipe is conducted by applying an electrical current at a constant voltage and for a predetermined time while fitting the joint on a pipe end or pressing the same against the pipe end so as to cause the interface to be molten thereby to melt and fuse the interface. In some cases, however, electrofusion is conducted without setting any definite time, i.e., by terminating the supply of electrical current upon detection of melting. For instance, the melting of the interface is detected by providing a detection hole b extending to the region near the electrical resistance heating wire a as shown in FIG. 11 and detecting the pressure of molten resin flowing into the hole by means of a pressure switch. According to the method of this type, bonding by fusion can simply be accomplished by fitting or pressing a joint to a pipe and then supplying an electrical current to the joint. Thus, electrofusion method of the type described enables the fusion bonding to be completed easily and in a short period of time as compared with the conventional method which requires the joint to be fitted or pressed to the pipe after thermally fusing the abutting surfaces of these joint and pipe. In addition, this type of method offers a comparatively high reliability of bonding by fusion.
One of problems encountered with this type of method is that completion of fusion cannot easily be confirmed through an appearance check, particularly when the length of time of the electrical power supply is fixed.
Conventionally, operators are obliged to lift, swing or pull the joint in order to confirm the pipe joint after the fusion, in order to confirm whether the fusion has been conducted safely.
Various other methods also have been proposed and used for the purpose of confirming the state of fusion. For instance, in one of these known methods, a detection hole 60 leading to a region in the vicinity of the electrical resistance heating wire is provided as shown in FIG. 4 and the state of fusion can be detected by observing the state of expansion of the molten resin through the hole 60. Alternately, a hole is formed in the joint so as to reach a region in the vicinity of the electrical resistance heating wire and a radially movable indicator is received in the hole so that the completion of fusion is confirmed by recognizing a radial movement of the indicator caused by spreading of the molten resin. In another known method, a temperature indicator tape capable of changing its color according to the temperature is adhered to the surface of the pipe joint so that the completion of fusion is detected through observation"

========================================================================================================================================================================================================

The mental health practitioner\'s entry in gynecology and their earliest role in treating patients with infertility dates back to the 1930s when nearly 30% of all cases were diagnosed to suffer from unexplained infertility. It was back then that infertility was thought to arise due to an unidentifiable medical condition and thus attributed to a latent psychodynamic conflict in the person. Women with infertility were understood to have an unconscious childhood conflict with their own parents resulting in two kinds of personality styles, i.e., emotionally immature or overambitious/masculine. Infertile men, on the other hand, were reported to have high sexual anxiety and experience an unconscious threat from their overprotecting and dominating mothers.\[[@ref1]\]

In the 1970s, the psychobiological linking between stress, behavior, and fertility started being explored. Historical records\[[@ref1]\] reflect that the first consumer movement and patient approach to psychological health and care in infertility were guided by Barbara Menning (an infertility nurse). Menning recognized the role of grief in infertility. She is acknowledged as the first person to openly talk about the emotional strain, religious myths, stigma, moral, and ethical dilemmas associated with it. She later went on to publish the first self-help book, formed the first infertility support group named as ""resolve"" and a newsletter to facilitate coping with its consequences. Menning added on that the ""advent of newer and better medical technologies placed a higher emotional risk for people subjected to them."" Infertile couples are vulnerable and exploited by several sources even today to ""have a baby at any cost.""\[[@ref1]\] Therefore, she recognized the role of mental health professionals (MHPs) and behavioral scientists in this field. She proposed that the infertility team should step forward to support the grief of couples and reduce the emotional burden of treatments through careful patient selection, psychological counseling, treatment insurance, and implementation.\[[@ref2]\]

Later, Menning\'s efforts and simultaneous birth of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) led to the establishment of a strong patient advocacy movement owing to which the agenda of ""emotional well-being of patients"" was brought to the forefront. Consequently, infertility distress began to be understood as a consequence of infertility rather than its cause. This stirred research on the positive and negative effects of infertility, gender-based outcomes, associated marital and sexual consequences, and treatment stage-wise effects on psychological health. The role of MHP during the earlier days was to find the most eligible patients for *in vitro* fertilizations (IVFs) and was restricted to determining suitability for donor programs. They were usually involved with the pretreatment screening and preadoption assessment. With time, this role changed to pretreatment counseling that catered to a larger group of patients, with the idea of developing models for meeting the emotional needs of patients during difficult treatment choices and stages. In addition, counseling was found to be helpful in preparing couples for treatments and protecting them from worsening mental health. Researchers began to believe that tailor-made interventional programs were beneficial for minimally distressed (about 80% of infertile patients) and especially advantageous for the high-risk population (20%--30% of patient population with depression/anxiety).\[[@ref3][@ref4][@ref5][@ref6]\]

In 1980s, the role of MHPs was expanded to enroll them as team members in third party reproductive programs (donor sperm, donor oocyte, donor embryo, multifetal pregnancy"

460,6,361," not automatically declare a child marriage void. It specifies that only if the child is taken away from their lawful guardian by enticement, force or deceitful manner, or is sold or trafficked for the purpose of marriage can the marriage be void. The other acceptable scenario to make a child marriage void is if a court injunction before the marriage itself was violated.

It is important for India to integrate child rights as the core issue in the fight against child marriages. This is not only about forced marriages, it about children entering wedlock without any prior understanding of the relationship as well as the consequences. It is about children held against their will. It is about denying children their basic right to life, education and development.

According to Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) report on child marriages in India, the law creates confusion by declaring some marriages void and some others voidable. Marriage of a minor solemnized by use of force, fraud, deception, enticement, selling and buying or trafficking is a void marriage, while all other child marriages are voidable at the option of the parties to the marriage and hence valid marriages until they are nullified by the court. If the law does not attribute consent to a child, it must render all child marriages void, as all child marriages then become marriages that have taken place either through some form of coercion or use of fraud, trafficking and such other illegal means, or by influencing the mind of the child.

In 2012, a Jaipur based NGO Sarathi Trust facilitated India’s first known child marriage annulment. Even though The Child Marriage Prohibition Act allows annulment of marriage, this is only possible by approaching the courts by either party in the marriage. In majority of the cases in India, both the parties in child marriage are minor children who might not be able to navigate themselves to approach law enforcement authorities or courts directly. A large number of children feel intimidated by lack of education and girls feel unsafe by reporting incidents against their married home or parents. The 2011 Census of India also indicated that girls were disproportionately effected by child marriage and that eight in ten illiterate children who were married were also girls.

One of the top reasons girls are not sent to school after puberty is because of fears regarding sexual safety and violence in spaces outside of home. It is very critical to create safe spaces for them to study, meet their peers and understands their sexual and reproductive rights. Even if a child is married before she turns 10, she remains at her parent’s home till she reaches puberty. These safe spaces will allow her to understand the consequences of her moving to a married home and might also give her strength and courage to exercise her rights to annul the marriage.

According to UNICEF, the best strategy to delay marriage for children is to retain them in school longer. According to Indian law, a child is entitled to free and compulsory education only till 14 years of age and many children from economically weak backgrounds drop out after"

Chronic diseases and their risk factors account for most of the global burden of disease.[@R1] Nine in 10 adult Australians have at least one of the behavioural or physiological risk factors for chronic disease including smoking, poor nutrition, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, overweight or obesity, hypertension or dyslipidemia.[@R2] General practitioners (GPs) are well placed to work with patients to manage these risk factors because of their high population coverage (over 80% of the population present in primary care at least once a year), and patient acceptance of their role in preventive care.[@R3] [@R4] They are thus in an ideal position to assess and provide advice about lifestyle-related behavioural risk factors.[@R5]

468,21,18773,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Surprised and upset by the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies, China has lowered expectations for significant progress from this week’s trade talks with the United States, Chinese government officials told Reuters, even as President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressed fresh optimism.

While Beijing theoretically wants to end the trade war, Chinese Communist Party officials are not optimistic about the size or scope of any agreement with Washington in the short-term, the Chinese officials said.

Top U.S. and Chinese trade and economic officials will meet in Washington on Thursday and Friday to try to end a 15-month-old trade war that is slowing the global economy and threatens to upend decades-old trade systems. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to take part.

Without significant progress, Trump is set to hike the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said: “If we can make a deal, we’re going to make a deal, there’s a really good chance.”

“In my opinion China wants to make a deal more than I do,” Trump added.

Based on the current situation, there is a possibility that this week’s talks between the world’s two largest economies could end in a deadlock, according to a Chinese official briefed on preparations for the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked about the probability of reaching an agreement, the official said, “This is not an easy task. It requires a lot of preparation work and consensus on both sides.”

For trade relations or overall ties between the two countries to improve, more time is needed, Chinese officials said.

While previous lower-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials aimed to create a good atmosphere for the upcoming meeting, the U.S. blacklisting of 28 Chinese companies has generated a negative atmosphere instead, Chinese officials said.

The U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday blacklisted video surveillance firm Hikvision and 27 others, days ahead of the talks. The Commerce Department barred the technology and artificial intelligence companies from doing business with U.S. firms, citing human rights violations of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. Chinese officials said the action interfered with China’s sovereignty.

Both sides should not escalate disputes or they will drift apart, said a second Beijing-based Chinese official briefed on the talks this week.

The trade talks come in the wake of tit-for-tat bans on certain visas for each other’s officials and a controversy sparked by a Twitter post by an executive with the National Basketball Association’s Houston Rockets supporting anti-government protests in Hong Kong.

“We can add the Diplomatic war to the Financial war, Currency war and Technology war, that we already have,” John Browning, managing director at brokerage BANDS Financial in Shanghai, said in a note to investors.

While there is a huge contingent of high-level Chinese officials traveling to Washington, “to my jaded perception it looks less than a delegation rather a funeral cortege,” Browning wrote.

The U.S. demand that the Chinese Communist Party fundamentally change how it directs China’s massive economy to shift to a more Western model of free-market capitalism is irrational and misguided, a Chinese diplomat in the United States said.

“What we achieved during the past few decades shows that our system is good for development in China,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

China would not ask the United States to shift to an economy that relies heavily on state-owned enterprises, or ask it to start fully funding education, as China’s does, he said, so why should Washington expect the same from Beijing?

Topping the news: Former first lady Michelle Obama told a Salt Lake City crowd yesterday that she cringes at climate of fear created by the current president. [Trib]

-> Rep. Chris Stewart tweeted -- and then quickly deleted -- a comment saying that liberals were wetting their pants over President Donald Trump’s speech to the United Nations. [Trib]

-> A legislative committee took the first step to raise fees for a concealed weapons permit this week to the dismay of The National Rifle Association and the Utah Shooting Sports Council. [Trib]

-> A new federal audit says Western Governors University should repay some $700 million in financial aid. [Trib] [DNews]

Tweets of the day: From @zblox: “If you had the parlay of ‘In 2017, Donald Trump will be President and BYU will sell Coke on campus,’ please return Biff’s Almanac.”

-> From @RobertGehrke: “It’s remarkable the lengths BYU will go to in order to distract people from their lousy football team.”

-> From @pbump: “Mike Allen should try contacting Spicer over Venmo.”

-> From @RepChrisStewart: “NK fires missiles over Japan. We do nothing. Putin invades Ukraine No responce. BYU sells coke. I can’t remain silent. The madness has to end.”

471,7,24770," the 3-foot arm on pole # 48 was a deviation from engineering plans and the modifications were noted in red before the work order was sent back to the engineering department. The work order, plaintiff's exhibit 20, contained the following notation:
""Removed pole top pin, installed 4 foot alley arm, crossbar, for clearances * * * Install 8 foot special bare cross-arm cut off for 4-foot alley arm.
Clearance for rotary antenna
T.V. antenna near phase wire * * *""
An ""X"" drawn on the map contained in the work order ""may have designated the tower.""
Subsequent to the installation of the tower and prior to the date of his injuries, plaintiff climbed up and down the tower with the antenna 30 or 35 times. About three weeks before the accident on April 5, 1970, plaintiff took the colinier antenna down from the tower and loaned it to a friend. During that period of time the only antenna on the tower was a small police antenna attached about one-third the distance from the top of the tower and facing south.
On the morning of April 5, 1970, plaintiff, then 16 years old, planned to replace the colinier antenna on top of the tower. He and a school friend, Glen Farfel, brought the colinier antenna back to the site and re-attached the horizontal radial arms to the vertical element of the antenna. The day was windy and near freezing and, after warming up inside the Spence home, the boys returned outside to put up the antenna. Plaintiff, facing north, climbed about 20 feet up the tower and Farfel handed him the uppermost portion of the antenna. Taking the antenna in his left hand, plaintiff tilted it slightly to clear the garage roof and then climbed to where his chin was even with the top of the tower. The antenna was in a vertical position and the horizontal radials pointed north, southeast and southwest. Plaintiff moved the antenna up by sliding it through his left hand and raising it with his right hand.
*1066 As to the position of the antenna when it came into contact with the 7200-volt phase wire, Farfel testified that plaintiff had raised the antenna its full length and was attempting to mount it in the tower when the antenna began to sway toward the power line. The antenna tipped one foot north and one of the radial arms came into contact with the 7200-volt phase"

As the total correlation can be split into a classical part and a quantum part [@Henderson.JPhysA.34.6899.2001], various measures of quantum correlations are proposed by considering different notions of classicality and operational means to quantify quantumness. Amongst them, quantum discord [@Ollivier.PhysRevLett.88.017901.2001] has attracted much attention. Quantum discord has been defined as the mismatch between two quantum analogues of classically equivalent expression of the mutual information. It can be also expressed as the difference between total correlation, measured by quantum mutual information, and the classical correlation defined in [@Henderson.JPhysA.34.6899.2001]. The notion of quantum discord goes beyond entanglement: separable states can have nonzero discord. In particular, it is believed that quantum discord is the figure of merit for the DQC1 model of quantum computation [@Datta.PhysRevLett.100.050502.2008]. Generally speaking, quantum discord plays an important role in quantum information processing [@Merali.Nature.474.24.2011].

In order to obtain the classical correlation (and thereby the quantum discord) of a bipartite quantum system, one has to perform measurement on one subsystem to extract the information about the other subsystem, i.e., locally accessible information. Hence this sort of one-sided measurements implies that classical correlation and quantum discord are not symmetric under the permutation of subsystems. As a measure of correlation, whether classical or nonclassical, one would expect that it is symmetric. Some symmetric measures of correlations have been proposed in Refs. [@Terhal.JMathPhys.43.4286.2002; @Horodecki.PhysRevA.71.062307.2005; @Luo.PhysRevA.77.022301.2008; @Modi.PhysRevLett.104.080501.2010]. The key step in obtaining these measures is to consider the classical-classical (CC) states. The state $\rho$ is called a CC state, if it can be expressed as the mixture of locally distinguishable states, namely, $\rho_{cc}=\sum_{i,j}p_{ij}{\vert i \rangle}{\langle i \vert}\otimes{\vert j \rangle}{\langle j \"

Hi everyone,

We are in need of beta testers for our VPN apps and service. We have a few
beta testers, but we are in need of many more.

The VPN provides new features that are unique to Oeck. We also offer high
levels of security. Any and all help would be very much appreciated.

The service is completely free for the duration of beta, so please feel free
to use the service for as long as you like.

Regards, Peter @ Oeck.

Why should we trust you with our internet traffic logs?

To add to this, three more pieces of feedback:

1\. Where is the company incorporated? This is a critical piece of information
when choosing a VPN provider, and I cannot find it anywhere on your website.
It should be front, and centre.

In Germany the law says you need an ""Impressum"" page added to your website,
with your company information on it. While I do not live in Germany, I made a
point of adding that page to every website I put online[1].

2\. The website does not work with JS disabled. If you tell me you sell
security, or privacy, and your website does not work with JS disabled, I will
likely walk away.

3\. In general, I tend to trust a company more if they open source their code,
and if they run their business in the open. Mullvad[2], and Confirmed VPN[3]
come to mind.

I would also recommend that you read, and try to meet the criteria set by the
PrivacyTools folks[4], as a lot of your target audience will come from them,
and trust their choices.

EDIT: Found the incorporation information in the FAQ after navigating a
bit[5]. That is on me, my sincere apologies.

477,19,21489,"Q:

Which transformations are canonical?

Which transformations are canonical? 

A:

Be aware that there exist various definitions of a canonical transformation (CT) in the literature:

Firstly, Refs. 1 and 2 define a CT as a transformation$^1$
$$ (q^i,p_i)~~\mapsto~~ \left(Q^i(q,p,t),P_i(q,p,t)\right)\tag{1}$$
[together with a choice of a Hamiltonian $H(q,p,t)$ and a Kamiltonian $K(Q,P,t)$; and where $t$ is the time parameter] that satisfies
$$  (\sum_{i=1}^np_i\mathrm{d}q^i-H\mathrm{d}t)
-(\sum_{i=1}^nP_i\mathrm{d}Q^i -K\mathrm{d}t)
~=~\mathrm{d}F\tag{2}$$
for some generating function $F$.
Secondly, Wikipedia (October 2015) calls a transformation (1) [together with a choice of $H(q,p,t)$ and $K(Q,P,t)$] a CT if it transforms the Hamilton's eqs. into Kamilton's eqs. This is called a canonoid transformation in Ref. 3.
Thirdly, Ref. 3 calls a transformation (1) a CT if $\forall H(q,p,t) \exists K(Q,P,t)$ such that the transformation (1) transforms the Hamilton's eqs. into Kamilton's eqs.
Fourthly, some authors (e.g. Ref. 4) use the word CT as just another word for a symplectomorphism $f:M\to M$ [which may depend on a parameter $t$] on a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, i.e.
$$ f^{\ast}\omega=\omega.\tag{3}$$
Here $\omega$ is the symplectic two-form, which in local Darboux/canonical coordinates reads $\omega= \sum_{i=1}^n\mathrm{d}p_i\wedge \mathrm{d}q^i$.
Fifthly, Ref. 1 defines an  extended canonical transformation (ECT) as a transformation (1) [together with a choice of $H(q,p,t)$ and $K(Q,P,t)$] that satisfies
$$ \lambda(\sum_{i=1}^np_i\mathrm{d}q^i-H\mathrm{d}t)
-(\sum_{i=1}^nP_i\mathrm{d}Q^i -K\mathrm{d}t)
~=~\mathrm{d}F \tag{4}$$
for some parameter $\lambda\neq 0$ and for some generating function $F$.

Now let us discuss some of the relationships between the above five different definitions.

The first definition is an ECT with $\lambda=1$. An ECT satisfies the second definition, but not necessarily vice-versa, cf. e.g. this and this Phys.SE post. 
The first definition is a symplectomorphism (by forgetting about $H$ and $K$). Conversely, there may be global obstructions for a symplectomorphism to satisfy the first definition. However, a symplectomorphism sufficiently close to the identity map and defined within a single Darboux coordinate chart does"
478,25,3027,Introduction {#s
479,9,12212,"In 1988, a bank called Guardian Savings and Loan made financial history by issuing the first ever “subprime” mortgage bond.

The idea was revolutionary.

The bank essentially took all the mortgages they had loaned to borrowers with bad credit, and pooled everything together into a giant bond that they could then sell to other banks and investors.

The idea caught on, and pretty soon, everyone was doing it.

As Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera describe in their excellent history of the financial crisis (All the Devils are Here), the first subprime bubble hit in the 1990s.

Early subprime lenders like First Alliance Mortgage Company (FAMCO) had spent years making aggressive loans to people with bad credit, and eventually the consequences caught up with them.

FAMCO declared bankruptcy in 2000, and many of its competitors went bust as well.

Wall Street claimed that it had learned its lesson, and the government gave them all a slap on the wrist.

But it didn’t take very long for the madness to start again.

By 2002, banks were already loaning money to high-risk borrowers. And by 2005, all conservative lending standards had been abandoned.

Borrowers with pitiful credit and no job could borrow vast sums of money to buy a house without putting down a single penny.

It was madness.

By 2007, the total value of these subprime loans hit a whopping $1.3 trillion. Remember that number.

And of course, we know what happened the next year: the entire financial system came crashing down.

Duh. It turned out that making $1.3 trillion worth of idiotic loans wasn’t such a good idea.

By 2009, 50% of those subprime mortgages were “underwater”, meaning that borrowers owed more money on the mortgage than the home was worth.

In fact, delinquency rates for ALL mortgages across the country peaked at 11.5% in 2010, which only extended the crisis.

But hey, at least that’s never going to happen again.

Except… I was looking at some data the other day in a slightly different market: student loans.

Over the last decade or so, there’s been an absolute explosion in student loans, growing from $260 billion in 2004 to $1.31 trillion last year.

So, the total value of student loans in America today is LARGER than the total value of subprime loans at the peak of the financial bubble.

And just like the subprime mortgages, many student loans are in default.

According to the Fed’s most recent Household Debt and Credit Report, the student loan default rate is 11.2%, almost the same as the peak mortgage default rate in 2010.

This is particularly interesting because student loans essentially have no collateral.

Lenders make loans to students… but it’s not like the students have to pony up their iPhones as security.

That’s what made the subprime debacle so dangerous.

Millions of homes were underwater, so when borrowers didn’t pay, lenders didn’t have sufficient collateral to cover their loan exposure.

With student loans, there is no collateral. Lenders have no security to recoup their loans.

So when students don’t pay, someone is going to take a hit.

That ‘someone’ will likely be you.

That’s because hundreds of billions of dollars of these student loans are either owned or guaranteed by the United States government.

So as borrowers stop making payments, it’s the taxpayer who will suffer yet another massive loss.

Let’s be honest, though, there’s something seriously screwed up with this system.

481,22,5576,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - A long-running Russian doping scandal. Corruption scams. Major cities say ‘no’ to staging the Olympics Games.

If the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were a publicly traded company, its stock might be struggling to stay afloat in a sea of damaging headlines.

Instead, it has never been in better financial health, thanks increasingly to enduring and growing support from Asia -- from the region’s sponsors, governments, cities and sports fans.

The IOC’s revenue from broadcast rights, its main income source, is setting records, touching $2.87 billion at the Rio summer Games in 2016, up 12 percent from London 2012, and is set to reach new heights at the Tokyo Games in 2020.

Its top sponsor program, which made up a fifth of its revenues in 2013-16, topped $1 billion for the first time between Russia’s 2014 Sochi winter Games and Rio 2016, two of the most challenging events for the Olympics brand.

Sochi, which cost around $50 billion, was a symbol of Olympics over-spending and is also now synonymous with alleged systematic Russian doping. Rio was hit by a ticket-scalping and corruption investigations involving senior Olympic officials.

But in interviews at the Pyeongchang winter Games, executives betting on the Olympic brand say they do not lose sleep over the scandals. Unlike misbehaving athletes who can lose sponsors overnight, the brand is “resilient”, some say.

Sponsors say their customers simply don’t care that much.

""I haven't seen any evidence that the brand has taken negative hits,"" said Louis Vega, vice president of Olympic and sports solutions for Dow DWDP.N, an IOC top sponsor.

Sponsors’ comments and the IOC’s swelling coffers contrast with some experts who doubt that the value of the Olympics brand can withstand the barrage of bad publicity and a drop in interest among Western cities in staging the Games.

Andrew Zimbalist, economist at Smith College in Massachusetts and a former adviser to a ‘No Olympics’ campaign in Boston, says sponsors understand this but won’t admit it.

482,29,23652,"The ability to quickly and cleanly sever tubular members, such as well casings that are deep underground, is an essential step during well maintenance and salvage operations. Typically, the industry relies on mechanical or explosive devices to perform such cutting. One type of explosive device, that is often used, is a shaped charge explosive cutter, which provides a simple, fast, and inexpensive method by which to sever pipes within a wellbore. During typical operations, shaped charge explosive cutters are lowered to a selected depth within a well, using a wireline, at which time they are detonated, producing pressure and/or molten materials that cut through the casing.
A typical shaped charge tubular cutting device contains two circular layers of explosive material, each having a truncated cone shape. Outlining the sloped side faces of the explosive circular layers are thin metal rings, called half-liners. These two components are joined together, apex-to-apex, forming a shaped charge assembly having a liner with a V-shaped cross section. The shape charge assembly is sandwiched between two end plates, typically made from steel. Lastly, the six elements (two layers of explosive, two half-liners, and two end plates) are aligned coaxially and enclosed within a cylindrical housing, in the recited order.
The end plates contain an opening along the central axis to provide a pathway for an explosive detonator to be placed adjacent to the top circular layer of explosive material. The two circular layers of explosive material may also contain an opening along their central axes, providing a space for an explosive detonator to be placed between the circular layers of explosive material.
After the shaped charge tool is assembled, it is lowered into the tubular member. For optimal effectiveness, the circular shaped charges within the tool must be aligned at a substantially perpendicular angle, relative to the tubular wall. Following the placement of the shaped charge tool at the proper location within the tubular member, the shaped charge is detonated.
Once the charge is detonated, a shock wave propagates radially along the transverse plane between the circular half charges and collides with the V-shaped liner, forcing the two liner surfaces together at high speeds. The resulting impact between the two liner surfaces results in extreme pressure being generated. At these high pressures, the metal liner exhibits plastic and/or fluid-like characteristics. While the expanding shock wave folds the metal liner together into a disc shape, the shock wave continues to advance radially along the transverse plane, pushing and accelerating the liner material to flow radially along the transverse plane at extreme velocities, forming a jet of liner material able to cut through the tubular member.
Traditional fabrication procedures for circular shaped charge tools include independent fabrication of the half-liner pieces, each having a truncated cone shape, with an open base and apex surface. The circular explosive discs can be formed using half-liners as the outside wall portions of the mold. The apex surface of the explosive disc is formed against the bottom of a flat mold, the explosive material is packed into the area between the mold and the half-liner, then a top mold plate is pressed against the explosive material, solidifying and bonding the material with the half-liner. This method forms a circular disc of explosive material, with the half-liner outlining the radial walls of the disc. A unified disc of explosive material bonded with a half-liner is called a half-charge. To form the shaped charge tool, two half charges are placed apex-to-apex, in a cylindrical housing between two steel plates, as described above.
Another traditional fabrication procedure for making circular shaped charge tools includes forming the circular explosive disc without half-liners outlining the radial walls of the explosive disc. The explosive charge material is formed into a truncated cone shape by using a mold to shape every surface of the charge, including the outside wall surface. This fabrication technique results in the half-liner and the explosive material disc being separate components, which must later be arranged within a cylindrical housing.
A shaped charge assembly comprising two or more explosive charge members, such as half-charges, results in small areas of"

487,5,17499," It was there held that if the original petition is deficient in the number of signers on the day of filing no jurisdiction can be invoked. Likewise if it later becomes deficient in that respect the jurisdiction already invoked is lost and no additional signatures may be supplied. It should be noted that the decision in that case was by the judge of the court of common pleas of Ashtabula county, Ohio. As we understand it, that is a trial court and not an appellate court.
It would be impossible to follow the jurisdictional rule in Wisconsin without reversing our prior decisions. If literally followed, the jurisdictional rule would prevent the withdrawal of signatures from the original petition. Under that *643 theory any time the number of signatures fell below the required number the council would lose jurisdiction to take any further steps with respect to the proposed annexation. However, we have held not only that signatures may be withdrawn at any time before final action by the city council but that those signatures can be reinstated by the filing of a petition withdrawing the withdrawals. This court has not had occasion to pass upon the filing of supplemental petitions containing the signatures of electors who did not sign one of the original petitions. However, two of our circuit judges, of dignity and intelligence equal, at least, to the judge of a court of common pleas in Ohio, have so ruled. It was so held in 1952 by E. M. DUQUAINE, circuit judge for Brown county, In re Town of Preble. It was also so held by FRANCIS X. SWIETLIK, circuit judge for Milwaukee county, in a suit between the town of Greenfield and the city of Milwaukee in 1955. The reasoning of those learned circuit judges is persuasive.
Therefore, we hold that, if other procedural steps outlined by the statutes are complied with, a city council must have a sufficient petition or petitions for annexation before it at the date of the introduction of the annexation ordinance and adoption of an order providing for its publication. The council must again determine that sufficient signatures of qualified electors are filed with it before it can finally enact the ordinance. Between those two dates signatures may be withdrawn and reinstated and supplemental petitions containing the signatures of qualified electors in the area who have not theretofore signed may be filed with and considered by the council in determining the sufficiency of the petitions at the time it finally enacts the ordinance. Under our procedure, the signing of the petitions is a substitute for a referendum to determine that a majority of the electors within the area favor annexation. Therefore, it must be determined by the city council that a majority of the electors do favor *644 annexation before an ordinance therefor can be introduced. A similar canvass of the petitions must be made just prior to the final enactment of the ordinance. The council did have petitions bearing the signatures of a majority of the electors within the area"

To honor the spirit of ""American Sniper"" and Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, Springfield Armory has announced the Legend Series 1911 TRP Pistol, with a portion of the proceeds going to provide direct support to the Chris Kyle FROG Foundation.

In his best-selling book, American Sniper, Kyle tells how his Springfield Armory TRP may have saved his life during combat.

“In 2004, I brought over a Springfield [Armory] TRP Operator, which used a.45 caliber round. It had a 1911 body style, with custom grips and a rail system that let me add a light and laser combo. Black, it had a bull barrel and was an excellent gun—until it took a frag for me in Fallujah. I was actually able to get it repaired—those Springfields are tough.”

Springfield Amory will produce one thousand TRP Legend Series pistols, each with a unique serial number ranging from CK0001 through CK1000. Separately, the company will laser engrave each pistol identifying its placement in the series.

The Legend Series pistols will come packaged in a custom and also serialized mahogany presentation case. Additionally, a memorial copy of the best-selling book, American Sniper, signed by Chris’ wife, Taya Kyle, will accompany the package. The attractive presentation case also includes a.999 pure silver Chris Kyle limited edition challenge coin and a Springfield Armory certificate of authenticity.



MSRP of the Legend TRP commemorative edition pistol is $2,499, with a portion of the proceeds from each pistol sold benefiting the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation.

The first pistol in the Legend Series was presented to Taya Kyle by Springfield Armory CEO Dennis Reese at a ceremony during the 2016 SHOT Show in Las Vegas. Kyle immediately announced her intention to auction this one of a kind pistol during the 2016 National Rifle Association Annual Meetings & Exhibits, with all proceeds to benefit the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation. Taya Kyle will auction Chris Kyle Legend Series 1911 TRP Pistol No. 1. This auction will take place in Springfield Armory booth #5823 at the NRA annual meetings in Louisville, Ky.





The on-line auction will go live Sunday, May 1 under Springfield Armory’s charity account on Gunbroker.com and will end at 3 p.m. May 21 at the NRA Annual Meetings. Live bidding will start at 2:45 p.m. in the booth. Persons who wish to bid live in the booth for this No. 1 Limited Edition pistol can sign up in the booth at 2 p.m. with a Springfield representative and receive a number and bidding paddle. You can view the live auction here.

Taya Kyle will be present to award the winner (if winner is present) with the pistols along with Springfield Armory President and CEO Dennis Reese. Upon completion of the auction, Springfield Armory will also present a check to Taya Kyle for the full amount of auction proceeds.

The following people will sign the serial No. 1 pistol certificate of authenticity: Taya Kyle of the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation; President and CEO of Springfield Armory Dennis Reese; NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, and NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox.

Now run by Taya Kyle, the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation supports members and families of those who serve. According to Taya Kyle, “One of the big benefits of doing this with Springfield Armory is that part of the proceeds will go to the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation. The mission of the foundation is to honor God, country and family by serving those who serve. To us, that"

Oleg Anatol'evich Matveychev (Russian: Олег Анатольевич Матвейчев, born 1 February 1970) is a Russian politician and spin doctor for the Kremlin. He is currently a professor at National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Matveychev has published various books on politics and public relations. One of the most popular Russian bloggers.

Career
In 1993 Matveychev graduated in philosophy from the Ural State University. He then did a PhD in the philosophy of politics and law with the thesis topic of Philosophy of Hegel's Politics and Modernity. From 1996 he became an active political consultant for Russian regional elections and participated in over 60 campaigns.

Politics
From 2006 to 2010 Matveychev was a staff member of Presidential Administration of Russia. 
In 2010 Matveychev became deputy governor of the Vologda Oblast.
In 2011 he became deputy governor of the Volgograd Oblast.

Controversy
In 2010, according to the Guardian newspaper, Matveychev caused controversy by writing on his blog that ""he dreamed of gathering the Russian opposition on a city square and calling in an army of tanks to mow them down. 'And then, like after Tiananmen in China, we would also have 10% annual economic growth after 20 or 30 years'"".

Matveychev is an opponent of copyright. He was involved in at least two plariarism scandals, where Matveychev was the one whose writings were plagiarized, once by Anna Chapman, and a second time by the Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky in his book ""Myths about Russia"", particularly in the chapter about ""unwashed Europe"" and ""clean Russia"". Matveychev had announced that he is not going to pursue any action as the copyright impedes innovation and ""behind every thought or object is every human being who ever lived"".

Matveychev is an author of alternative theory about ending of Trojan War, with the Trojans as winners.

Additionally, Matveychev was behind the idea to change a name of a real person to Harry Potter to participate in Yekaterinburg regional elections.

While many devices such as the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 advertise things like 5x zoom cameras, many aren’t true optical zoom. The difference is that optical zoom has no loss in quality, while digital zoom will either dump resolution in exchange for a tighter field of view, or just artificially add detail to a digital crop.

Huawei is one of the few companies that has been consistent in its focal length claims, using innovative methods to achieve lossless long lenses. The P30 Pro was an achievement in its own right: It was one of the first phones to achieve true 5x optical zoom with a prism mechanism, which reflected the light 90 degrees to a tilted sensor for extra z-distance.

US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has been lobbying heavily for US interests behind the scenes [EPA]

New York, New York - Some years back, the Comedy Channel featured a map illustrating how most Americans see the world. The biggest part of it was pictured as ""US""; the rest of the world was shown as ""THEM"".

This may be true of public understanding - in part, because of the way our media works or doesn't work - but it's not true of the way our government operates as an often stealth force in global affairs.

Inside Story - Saving the euro

For many, the crisis in Europe resembles the saying ""What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas"" - they see it as a clash of countries rather than currencies or interests, ignoring America's omnipresent financial presence and role in a number of Europe's problems that were undeniably made worse by irresponsible spending on every level.

In fact, it was American firms and banks that shovelled many of the loans into European countries that they are struggling to pay back. It was they who encouraged Europe's banks to take on much of the very debt that they are now complaining about.

American companies also encouraged Europe's financial institutions to invest in fraudulent subprime loans and derivatives that cost them billions.

That's why some on the Continent were blaming the US for exporting a type of ""financial AIDS"", or likening the economic collapse to financial terrorism. Now that so many of these deals collapsed, plunging Europe into crisis, the US is working in a shadowy manner to put ""Humpty Dumpty"" back together.

As the Washington Post reports:

""Senior US officials are playing a behind-the-scenes role in efforts to contain the European debt crisis, cajoling the region's leaders to take more steps to calm markets and trying to mediate among European governments with competing interests.

""US officials have served at times as a quiet intermediary between European political leaders and the powerful European Central Bank, which tries to stay out of the political fray. In particular, according to US officials, Americans have passed along information about how much money European governments might be willing to contribute to a rescue fund, a crucial question for the central bank as it considers its actions.""

It is not just the government that is meddling here, but also the powerful Federal Reserve Bank, which many Europeans think of as a government institution when it is actually run by privately-held US banks and operates in their interest. (It too operates secretly, but was just forced to reveal that it loaned a whopping $17.7tr in 2008 to save many banks, some of which were in Europe.)

-   Finally in Section V, we illustrate the feasibility of content-centric wireless networks with an exemplary campus wireless network that encompasses the above concepts.

Exploiting new dimensions in wireless content delivery
======================================================

Historically, leapfrogs in mobile communications are often associated with the discovery of new dimensions and diversities. The breakthroughs in time-frequency, code, space, and multiuser diversities have been the sources of wireless bit rate breakthroughs (by three orders of magnitude) for the past three decades. In light of the fact that the mobile media contents are highly diversified, both in characteristics and distribution channels, we can anticipate a dramatic increase of the ability of mobile content delivery by exploiting the so-called content diversity (at application level) and network diversity (at infrastructure level), via approaches that take advantage of the computation and caching capabilities within the wireless networks.

Various approaches have been attempted to exploit the content and wireless network diversities. In particular, the so-called *converged network*, which combines broadcasting with cellular, provides a highly efficient and practical means to simultaneously capture the content and network diversity gains. A number of results have been reported on converged network. The authors in [@adaptiveScheme] proposed and analyzed a hybrid scheduling scheme for mixed multicast and unicast traffics in cellular systems. A collaborative scheme is proposed in [@cost_converged] to optimize the trade-off"
